There should be a small amount of fabric that you can pinch up at the heal. Although, it should not be baggy. 4.	the heel of the shoe may slip off. This does not mean it is too long. Once you sew on ribbons and the elastic the problem will be fixed. Pay close attention to if you are slipping down in the shoe. If you are, the shoe is too big, which could cause problems such as bad blisters if danced on. Does everything feel comfortable? Does this particular style of shoe enable your foot to be in the correct position? If not, then you should try a different style, or even different brand. Make sure to pointe and flex your feet to ensure that the heel is not painfully tight. If everything looks and feels great, then you have found a keeper!

Adjust_Abnormally_Positioned_Canine_Teeth.txt	Begin_Revision	0.846	### Realigning Your Dog's Teeth	23	However , this process is poorly documented and only recommended in extreme conditions .	### Understanding Canine Teeth	94	This process is poorly documented and only recommended in extreme conditions .	<delete><However><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><this><3><This><1>	True	"Realigning Your Dog's Teeth  1. Let your dog play with a hard rubber ball or Kong toy for 45 minutes a day. If the jaw length discrepancy your pup is dealing with is minimal, this conservative, readily available option may suffice. A hard rubber ball or Kong toy of appropriate size used during active play for a minimum of 15 minutes three times a day can act as a passive orthodontic device to help lateralize the mandibular canine teeth. * The technique in the Journal of Veterinary Dentistry showed correction in 28 of 38 cases in young dogs of various breeds and partial improvement in three additional dogs. In all the cases where the technique failed, there was not just a tooth in the wrong position, but rather a skeletal malocclusion. 2. Try an orthodontic device known as an ""inclined plane."" The second most conservative treatment option is a passive orthodontic device called an inclined plane, usually placed at 7 to 9 months of age. This is most commonly made with a composite material that can be fabricated to allow for a “sliding board” effect. The device engages the mandibular canine teeth when the mouth is nearly closed, resulting in slow, lateral movement of the canine teeth, guiding the tooth to its normal space. * The most common type of material used to create the device is a chemical-cured composite used for temporary crowns in humans. The material exits the mixing tip as a liquid but hardens to a solid mass within a few minutes. * The teeth are etched prior to placement, which allows the composite to adhere to the teeth. Composite is placed on the etched and dried teeth to allow for retention, and the material is built up over the area of palatal trauma. Once the material sets, it is shaped with burs to allow for the ideal angulation and divergence of the mandibular canine teeth. 3. If you do choose to use an inclined plane, take good care of your dog's teeth. This device requires good home care and thorough brushing to keep the device clean. In addition, it may become dislodged if dogs are allowed to chew on hard items while the device is in place. Monitor what your dog chews on and brush his teeth regularly to make sure this device stays effective * The device may be kept in the mouth as a retainer once the teeth have moved to their desired position, or a retainer may be placed between the mandibular canine teeth for at least a few months to prevent the teeth drifting back to their original position. Continue monitoring your dog's teeth to see if this is necessary. 4. Turn to crown reduction if necessary. The third option for treatment of mal-positioned permanent mandibular canine teeth is crown reduction. Since removal of even a small portion of the crown will result in pulp exposure, this procedure is done with an aseptic technique, and once the crown is reduced to approximately the height of the adjacent mandibular third incisor tooth, a portion of the coronal pulp is removed to create space for placement of medicament and filling material. * Also called vital pulp therapy, this procedure has a high rate of success when pulp exposure occurs aseptically and the duration of pulp exposure is confined to minutes rather than days or hours. The material placed directly on the pulp may be either calcium hydroxide or mineral trioxide aggregate. * After this part of the process, a glass ionomer intermediate restorative layer is placed, followed by a layer of composite to provide a seal that prevents bacteria from penetrating the previously exposed pulp. Though this procedure can be done in one administration of anesthesia, monitoring with dental radiographs is recommended at six months postoperatively and every 12 months thereafter. 5. If absolutely necessary, get the teeth extracted. The final treatment option is extraction of the mandibular canine teeth that are causing palatal trauma. This is perhaps the least desirable option because the mandibular canine teeth comprise such a large part of the rostral mandible, and as a result extraction of both mandibular canine teeth will likely lead to functional and esthetic changes. *"	The mandibular canine tooth is the largest tooth in the dog's mouth and the attachment root is strong too. Extraction of the canine tooth will cause potential functional, long-term changes. Moreover, it is not recommended in an aesthetic point of view. The mandibular canine tooth consists of roots above 60-70% of the total length. The surgical procedure to extract the canine tooth is often discouraged.

Decide what kind of cat to get. Do you want a pedigreed cat or a ""moggie,"" the cat word for mutt? Pedigreed cats are beautiful, but they often come with health problems. Moggies aren't purebred but they are less expensive to adopt and have fewer health and personality issues. * If you're interested in a pedigreed cat, research reputable breeders and be sure to get confirmation that the cat is coming from someone with plenty of experience in genetics and breeding. * Since the parentage of moggies isn't usually known, it's important to make sure they are tested for diseases upon adoption. 2. Decide what age the cat will be. Adopting a kitten can be a lot of fun, but it also takes a lot more work than adopting a cat. Kittens are full of energy and aren't yet independent, while cats can usually fend for themselves pretty well, and their presence tends to be more serene. * If your family has very young children or babies, it's not a good idea to adopt a kitten, since kittens should never be handled roughly. * Consider adopting a cat on the older side if you are a senior yourself. Older cats tend to get overlooked at shelters, but they usually make excellent companions later in life. 3. Decide between getting a male or a female cat. Males and females have different behavioral tendencies before they are neutered or spayed, so if you're not planning on having your cat fixed, the sex is something to keep in mind."	Once male or female cats have have been fixed, their personalities and behavior aren't very different. The male and female sexes have an equal chance of being sweet, friendly, excitable, or difficult.

Wear whatever clothes you like (usually really contrasting colors, try mixing it up a little, bit of blue, bright green or even a MC Hammer gold out fit would work the best!). There is no official dress code you have to follow, so have fun with it! Some ravers (guys and girls) wear phat pants, light, baggy pants with a wide leg. They sometimes have reflictive fabric on them, and you can easily dance with them. Colored clothes reflect the black light and look awesome when you dance. 2. Decide what you want to do with makeup. Many people don't even wear make-up to raves because they sweat it off, while others wear very bright colors.	You can wear as much or as little as you like, or anywhere in between. But many people like to be crazy with their makeup, because you can get as crazy with your outfit as you want when you go to a rave.

Make the following public profiles - MySpace, Facebook, Nexopia, Tagged and/or Bebo. All scene kids have them and if you want to be a scene kid then making a MySpace is a good place to start. Make sure that your skin is original with something like Hello Kitty on it or cute hearts. Your 'About Me' should be original and you have to big your life up, to get people interested. Blog about your life and make people want to know what you've got up to. Make a myspace name, for example Kiki Kannibal, Danni Doll, Vickee Venom, Haley Havok. 2. Learn how to use scene lingo but don't actually use it until the end of your transformation. Two main words that you need to learn are HxC and SxE. HxC stands for hardcore. When you write it on MySpace/Bebo write it as hardxcore first time and then use HxC. SxE does not mean sexy, it means straight edge. That means that you don't drink, smoke, do drugs or have casual sex. Add letters onto the ends of words for example RAWRR and radd and kiddd. If another girl has really cool clothes then tell her they are 'so vogue' and say that a band is 'the sex'. Don't ever use this lingo to kids that aren't scene since they wouldn't know what: 'That guy is the sex, he is so hardxcore and raddd' means. When commenting peoples photo's add oxox or <333 at the end with some little smiley faces [:. Use good grammar and don't write things lyke thiss. NOBODIi WANTS TUU TAlK TUU SOMEONE LiYKE THiS! Scene kids are growing up and they don't like it when you spell like a four year old. 3. Get the scene haircut. The best scene hair I would recommend would be to get choppy layers at the top of your hair. To style this you have to straighten the ends and apply wax on the crown. Then take a comb and backcomb the crown. Apply heaps of hairspray. Add a cute bow to the side, making sure it isn't too big and isn't too small. If you have the money invest on some extensions in any colour you want or some raccoon tail extensions. If this is your first scene hair colour then have your hair dyed either black or bleached blonde. Add some crazy streaks of whatever colours you want. If your school has a problem with coloured streaks in your hair, buy a pack of extensions of different colours and stick them in your hair whenever you get home. If you get the hair right then that is the major part of being scene. 4. Dress like a scene kid. Skinny Jeans are essential to the making of a scene girl. Wear skinny jeans in whatever colour you'd like. The best colors are red light gren dark green light blue and basical any neon colors Wear them with band tee's of legendary glam rock bands like Kiss and on your feet wear Vans or convers. Any kind of boots are acceptable and any tees with HELLO KITTY scene kids love hello kitty, disney characters, polka dots and any kind of character on it are acceptable. As is wearing a black skirt with some neon colored leggings. You can never go wrong with a good pair of neon leggings. 5. Accesorize like a scene kid. Put cute hair clips in your hair, but if you truely want to be a scene girl never wear little plastic bows, they make you look cheap.	If you are artistic make your own necklaces out of Hamma Beads and put them on chains. If you get good at this you can sell them on the internet which will raise your popularity as well as earning you some extra money(See ManufacturedBeauty or VickeeVenomJewelry for examples). Completely over accessorize. Consider getting some piercings. Make sure you have two or three piercings on your ears and you can add piercings on your lips,like snakebites.

Get real and assess what your actual ""needs"" are versus what the system is trying to force you to want, desire and believe your needs are. In order to do that, you must truly understand five words and the commonness and difference between them: , , , and . Look them up. Then look up their etymological roots (derivatives) so that you understand quite thoroughly their full meaning. Use the references provided in the Sources and Citations section at the bottom of the article to do so. Also, write down what this ""planned obsolescence"" culture is trying to get you to do and consume and want. You can still want to fit into the culture and that's OK, just so long as you're fully aware of what you're doing and why you're doing it. Fit, habit and adaptation are very real parts of socialization and the human species has succeeded in large part because of its ability to socialize well. However, spending a lot of money you don't really have just to 'fit' in socially with the latest fashion trend is money you might well regret spending if and when a major depression hits. The ""youth market"" is a prime target of advertisers because it is not yet well-informed, often overly concerned with being popular with people who will be forgotten in later years and ignorant of the true sacrifices made to make the money spent to acquire such articles and artifice. It's very artificial and superficial spending that produces a lot of discards. Meanwhile, people are going hungry, being poorly educated, killed for their speech and beliefs, raped and their votes overwhelmed with cheating ... not to mention the animals and plants going extinct and the pollution of the oceans and minds everywhere with crap, fears and propaganda. In order to be positive, one must be disciplined, strong, creative, self-assured and effective. One must have an actual grasp of reality and not be deluded by all the false hopes and promises luring one to buy into a dream world that just does not exist, except perhaps in fake images from Hollywood studios of people whose claim to fame and fortune is based mostly on selling false sexuality. False eyelashes never made for better babies with more appealing eyelashes! 2. Assess what level of risk you are willing to tolerate -- more risk may usually be assumed when one is young, quick and healthy than when one is old, slow and more susceptible to ailments. See Develop a Risk Management Plan and Write a Risk Assessment. 3. Decide how much you need to relate to the rest of society -- can you go for long periods happily doing your own thing with minimal contact with the outside world or are you the sort of person who needs societal contact and feedback most all the time? * No one can answer these questions for you, and for many people, the answers may take considerable time to find out with a high degree of certainty."	Are you patriotic and feel a duty to serve your country that supports you? Are you willing to do what it takes to prepare for worst-case scenarios? Lastly, are you good at self-assessment, really? Do you truly know your actual strengths and weaknesses? If one were to ask you whether these days it is wiser to generalize or specialize, would you know how to answer and why? By reading this article, you will get a grasp of the basics you need to know and do to cope, survive and thrive.

Make your studies a priority. Successful students know how to succeed because they’ve made their studies their top priority. Though it’s important to make time for friends, family, extracurricular activities, and even some solo down time, you should never neglect the time you need to spend studying. If you have a big exam coming up and don’t feel prepared, then you should probably skip the big party two days before it. If you’re really behind on your French, then you may need to skip that new episode of Criminal Minds for the time being. This doesn’t mean that you can never do the things you want to do, but that you should recognize when studying should be at the top of your list. * That said, you can’t ignore everything in the world just so you can study. If a friend or family member is having a crisis, you can’t ditch him or her just to study, either. 2. Be punctual. Develop the habit of judging time and learn how to arrive where you need to be on time. In fact, you should plan to be a bit early anywhere you go so you have time to get situated, focused, and ready to learn when you get there. Whether you have to take a test or have a study date with a friend, it’s important to be on time if you want to be a successful student. 3. Work honestly. This means you should do your own work, avoid copying, and avoid cheating at all costs. Cheating won’t get you anywhere, and what may seem like a shortcut one day can actually get you into a lot of trouble the next. It’s never worth it to cheat on a test, and you’re far better off not doing well on an exam you’re not prepared for than getting caught cheating.	.

The term emo is loosely associated with emotionally charged punk rock, however it originally meant emotionally hardcore - modern 'emo' music is more of a branch off from what it started out as. Most emos like underground or indie music. Emo has branched out from punk/indie. 3. Support the music. Emo is a rock music genre, usually consisting of emotional lyrics and (optional) ""screamo"". Over the years, this music genre was usually seen as underground until recent times, making emo music more popular than ever. This music sometimes consists of lyrics seen by many as ""whiny"", and ""sensitive"", which is not true in all instances. Remember that MTV does not portray the ""correct"" or ""true"" emo. All-in-all, 'emo music' mostly consists of deep lyrics. (Linkin Park, Hawthorne Heights, From First to Last, Death Cab for Cutie...) * Consider taking up an instrument such as the bass, guitar, drums or even the violin. If you invest enough time into it, the violin can sound incredibly emo. * Try writing poetry and turning it into songs. It will help your mind, body, and spirit metamorph into being a true emo. 4. Test yourself. Try listening to emo music. If you end up liking this type of music, you’re probably a ""true"" emo. Try bands such as Hawthorne Heights, Dashboard Confessional, Panic! At The Disco, Death Cab for Cutie, From First to last... Getting inner emo is all a matter of finding out if you have it or not. 5. Dress the part. After you have discovered your inner emo, try shopping for a new wardrobe. Emo fashion has roots in punk, goth, and scene. Wear pencil tight jeans, tight shirts with emo band logos on them, studded belts, and an old, black and worn down pair of Chuck Taylor Converse or Vans. Thick, black-rimmed glasses are not uncommon for emo guys. Also, stripes and checkers are big in the emo culture. It is Emo to wear dark colors with a bit of neon mixed in, but no emos will tease you for wearing colors. 6. Change your hair. Dye it black with perhaps some blond or unnatural colored streaks, especially in the bangs. If you are a girl, you may possibly want to cut your hair to a very short bob-like hairstyle but keep your bangs long, swept drastically to one side and covering your eye. Or, for those who like Long hair, get many choppy layers and highlights. For a guy, you may want to spike up the back side, and pat down on the front side. You could also get your bangs/fringe dyed a lighter color than the rest of your hair. 7. Get the attitude. A lot of times, Emo is associated with being bitter, depressed, insecure and resentful. But at its core, you can be Emo because you're sensitive, introspective, thoughtful, and quiet. 8. Learn to love yourself and others. The truth is, you and everyone else are all people deep down, and even though we all want to be noticed for our individualities, It's essential not to segregate yourself. Even though you may look different, treat everyone else as your equal, and don't stick to only having Emo friends if you don't want to. Just do what makes you happy socially. * Kindness is a basic expectation for social skills, and even if you decide to go along with this guide on the way to being Emo, don't ever think that people outside of this culture don't understand you. Without the look, you may very well be the same as them. The popular cheerleader and/or jock at your school may have similar everyday problems as you. Loving yourself is also very important. 9."	Goths tend to act different because they don't want to act like everyone else, and try to be original, and not try to follow others.

Keep on listening to any country song over and over again so you can learn the song. 2. Try to find your vocal range because country singers can hit VERY high notes like Carrie Underwood in ""Jesus take the wheel"" 3. Listen to country music and listen carefully. * Girls may want to listen to Martina Mcbride, Carrie Underwood, Allison Krauss, Kellie Pickler, Sara Evans, and especially Taylor Swift. * Men may want to listen to Tim McGraw,George Strait, Kenny Chesney, Keith Urban, Brad Paisley, or Toby Keith. 4. Find a song that you like and learn it. After you learn the song, keep practicing again and again; that way you can find your voice but yet not trying to sound like the person who sang the song. 5. After you find your voice, try to write your own lyrics. You may want to include an acoustic guitar in your song; it's a classic country instrument. 6. Writing Your Own Songs: 7. A good songwriter takes what they feel inside and puts it on paper, but it's not just about you. Make it something other people can relate to."	Taylor Swift did it in Music Row, and she ended up getting discovered.

EQUIPEMENT NECESSARY TO START As with any business, large or small, there is an initial outlay of money. But with grant writing, your initial expenses are for the most part a one time outlay. You will need an up-to-date computer (you may choose either an Apple Computer or a Windows based computer), which ever one you choose, I suggest you go with either a notebook or laptop style computer. Either one will make your life easier when you start to make trips to your local library to conduct research or to call on clients. If you choose a Windows based computer, get one that has either Windows 8 or 8.1 as the operating system. If you decide to wait on a new computer you might like the new Windows 10.0 operating system. If you choose to go with an Apple computer, I would strongly suggest getting one with the OS X Snow Leopord operating system. Regardless of which computer system you choose, make sure you keep up with the latest updates for either model. In addition to the software that comes installed on your computer it is essential that you have a solid word processing package like MS Word and an accounting package such as Excel. Most nonprofit organizations use MS Word and Excel. This will make your life, as well as that of your clients, much more pleasant when sending documents, attachments and spreadsheets back and forth. You will also need a solid laser printer (many grant makers specify all printing be laser printing), a land-line telephone as well as a cell phone, a reliable Internet provider and both a fax machine and a separate fax telephone number, business cards and a viable website. Of course you will need file folders, several reams of printing paper as well as pens, pencils, notebooks, and index cards for keeping notes on your clients. one step here and then click ""Add Step"" 2. SPECIAL NICHES Most successful grant proposal writers have a specialized niche or industry for which they write grant proposals.A niche is generally based on something that you have experience with, such as employement, or a cause or project that you ma havevolunteering experience with. I chose to write in the area of Children’s Sports, Public Safety and Homeless Veterans causes. Regardless of what niche you choose, it is alwys a good idea to remain available to write on just about any subject matter that presents itself. You do not have to be an expert on all aspects or causes, just be able to conduct research on the topic and take good notes. Learn as quickly as possible all of the key terms associated with the topic, read as much as possible about the subject on the internett and take as many notes as possible so that you can talk intelligently with your client about the subject. 3. RESEARCH A good deal of your time in industry is going to be in the area of research. Researching your client, the subject matter of the grant itself, who are the grant makers, what grants are available and how much grant money is available for a certain type of grant and many other topics. This will be a very large part of your billing to your client. You may decide to bill for research independent of the actual grant writing, or you may decide to include it all together, but it will behoove you to keep a record of the actual time you spend on research and make sure you bill accordingly. If you take the time to engage in a grant proposal writing service I would suggest that you contact someone in your area, like the Y.W.C.A. or American Red Cross and ask them if they may have several older copies of grant proposals that you could have to read and study. Explain to them that you are new to grant writing and would like to read complete and funded grant proposals. If you have a college or university in your area contact them for additional grant proposals that you might read. Almost any non-profit organization will have copies of older grant proposals that they will gladly give you copies. From these you will learn more of what makes a winning grant proposal than from most books. 4. If you are new to the grant writng industry, I would suggested several ways to enhance your ability to make a living form grant writing: * Take a course or two on grant writing from your local community college or universtiy * Volunteer at any nonprofit organization in your aera, ask to volunteer in the grant department. * Read the book Grants for Dummies, available at your local book store. Make sure to get the latest edition. * Go on line and watch any number of grant writing seminars 5. How Much Money Can You Make As A Freelancer? For those individuals who are just entering the grant profession as a novice freelancer you are probably wondering how much money you might expect to make. As a freelancer you can expect, depending on how well you market yourself, on your writing skills, and if your website if you have one. The national average for a novice proposal writer is about $39,000 per year. Those individuals with 3-5 year experience may expect a yearly income of approximately $69,000. (wageindicator.org). At the same time there are conditions that you have little or no control over, such as the time of year you enter the field, the local and national economy, how much money Congress has set aside for government grants and just how generous foundations are feeling from one particular year to the next.. For example, Google the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the largest foundations in existence and see how much they give from year to year. Or try any of the larger foundations such as Wal-Mart Foundation, the National Football Foundation or any others you may be curious about. After you have checked out some of your favorite foundations, congratulate yourself, you have just started to learn the lesson of grant research. A skill that is vital to your Grant Proposal Business. 6. The final, and for some, the hardest step is marketing yourself Thsi means contacting nonprofit organizations in your area to start with. As you grown in experience you may choose to take on clients nationally. If you do not have any grant proposals that you have writen that you can show potential cleints, but have volunteered and been a part of grant writing team, ask that non-profit organizaiton to write you a recommenation that you can present to potential clients."	Take time to thank them, once you have more experience you may approach them again. Good Luck!

Know yourself. This is the first and possibly the most important rule. Knowing yourself, your values, your personality, your strengths and weaknesses, your history and what you want to achieve in the future is crucial to Wicca. Love yourself and don't attempt to change your inner values or personality for others. It can help to write down self-biographies and keep track of your opinions on things by debating, writing or talking with friends. 2. Know your craft. This is not only things you have read in books or online (such as this), this is also your own personal experiences. Keep a grimoir of journal and note down interesting experiences, rituals, correspondence charts, and other things you've learnt. Keep it as a record of all your knowledge and information related to Wicca. 3. Learn. You should never decide you know all there is to it- Wicca is an undulating and complex thing, so there's always new information out there. Once you've studied all the planets, herbs and omens you can, look online and learn about other people's views and opinions. Remember to also learn from yourself, your mistakes and the world around you. 4. Apply knowledge with wisdom. You can know how to perfectly execute a ritual, but if you have malicious or harmful intentions, it has a big chance of back-firing at your expense. Know what's a sensible way to achieve your goals- for example, if you and your best friend are having an argument, it might be better to talk to them rather than use magic. Also, keep in mind mundane restrictions on your craft, such as stigma, secrecy, financial situations or other responsibilities. While your craft should take a big place in your life, attend to urgent things first. 5. Achieve balance. Most of Wicca is about this concept in some ways- using all five elements, balancing the masculine and feminine, celebrating throughout the cycle of the year, etc. The struggle for many is celebrating all of these parts equally, instead of just the one they feel the most connected to or the one that's easiest to connect to for them. You can do this by focusing on one element or deity or concept per week, and rotate between them, developing a connection between each. ""A Witch's Primer"" by Ariel, a series of podcasts, covers this ""power base"" rotation concept thoroughly, and guides you through it. 6. Keep your words in good order. Avoid slander or gossip as much as possible, and don't become excessively aggressive- anger is good, but violence is not."	"Not to yourself, to friends, enemies, family, the internet, or anyone else. It's bad for you spiritually, and reduces the power of your intentions during rituals, spells and other magical workings. Keep your word and avoid even ""white lies"". If you must lie, lie by omission and change the subject as soon as possible. Keep your words meaningful and choose them wisely, like you would an incantation."

Research your credit score. If you do not have a credit history or believe that you might have a bad credit history, you should research your credit score. The best resource for this is annalcreditreport.com. This site allow you to get one free credit report from each of the three credit bureaus per year. * Your credit is calculated by three separate agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You should check all three. Some smaller lenders will only report to one of the three, so that you credit scare is liable to vary from one to the other. * Credit scores range from 300 to 850. The average credit score is approximately 650-700, depending upon the credit bureau. 2. Apply within your means. If lenders see that you have made multiple applications for credit, this will affect your score and reduce your likelihood of receiving a card. This can reduce your score by as much as 10%. You should be aware of what your credit score qualifies you for and apply exclusively for cards that you are likely to get. * A credit score of 700 or up will qualify you for a majority of cards, including some cards with very good benefits. * If your credit score is anywhere from 600 to 700, you can get an average credit card, but might have some difficulty. It is improbable that you will get a card with great benefits. Pay close attention to the average credit score of those receiving a card that you are considering applying for. Do not apply if the average is much above your own credit score. * If your credit score is under 600 it is unlikely that you will receive a credit card. Instead you should start out by becoming a cosigner on someone else’s card or by getting a secured card. 3. Get a secured card. A secured card is a way to establish your credit if it is below 600, allowing you to eventually get an unsecured credit card. For a secured card, you will need to deposit cash in your account as collateral. Your spending limit will be approximately what you deposited, so that it functions almost like a debit card. 4. Sign up for a linked account. If you have a parent or a spouse, who trusts you, you can ask if you can be added to her account. If they have good credit and handle the card appropriately, it can increase your credit score. There are two ways to this, with their own pros and cons. * Cosign on an account. If you cosign on an account you will be equal partners with the other party. You will be responsible for payments and cannot be removed from the account without closing it, which will reduce your score. A cosigned account requires more trust from the other party, but is often better for increasing your credit score. * Become an authorized user. An authorized user is someone who can use a credit card, but is not responsible for payments and can be removed from the account at any time. For many, this is the more convenient arrangement. However, in recent years, some accounts have stopped reporting information on authorized users to the credit bureaus. Conveniently, American Express only reports positive information about authorized users, making it one of the better companies for increasing your score with an authorizes usership. 5. Leverage your international history. Unfortunately the credit bureaus do not consider any transactions conducted outside of the nation. If you are coming from another country, you must essentially start from scratch in building a credit history.	Some will to be willing to offer credit cards based on this information.

Make sure you do have the body type NYCB is looking for. That being said, if you really have no idea, the only way to find out is to audition for SAB (School of American Ballet), the feeder school of NYCB (New York City Ballet). But remember that from a certain age, technique must be solid even with raw talent and a ballet body. 2. Enroll and audition for SAB (School of American Ballet). SAB is the feeder school of NYCB (New York City Ballet). And NYCB doesn't hold auditions - they choose their dancers from the SAB apprentice program. 3. If not accepted, consider auditioning at the later age of 16, when many ballet students start apprenticing. Your body may change over time, and there will be room for your technique to grow. If it seems as though it was the technique that was lacking, try to improve your technique. However, if it was that you didn't have the SAB body type, don't bother to audition again, unless your body changes dramatically as time passes. 4. If accepted, congratulations, but the battle is not over. Every year, students are asked out or assessed out. And only a handful are picked for the apprentice program - and not everyone from the apprentice program is asked to join NYCB.	.

Keep away from extremists views and thoughts. Much extremism is dictated by certain books, websites and governments! Keep away from anything which draws you away from Allah! 2. Join a progressive or modern Islamic group. Leave ridiculous, sexist, racist, unequal, non humanistic, sexual, hate views to the people and groups who make them up! Join those who are more concerned with their relationship with Allah than political fatwas of stupidity. 3. Don't be a slave to anything which does not draw you close to Allah. If you believe in certain views express them and embrace them. Be free, please Allah with the mind and intellect he gave you. 4. Decide what's important and what's not. Muslims can be stereotyped but by being part of a modern Islamic group, progressive, women's, equality, Quran and Sunnah group you will have a new identity not tainted by all the things that draw you back and stop you from serving Allah. Let go of all the things which are ungodly and spread hate not peace in your heart. 5. Live a pure and holy life one dedicated to Allah in prayer. Making sure all 5 prayers are regular as well as Dua. Some love the Arabic words and find closeness in Salah therefore finding out the meanings in ones language give prayer more meaning. However you choose to pray (whether short or long rakaats) or fast let Allah be your guide and helper. The most important thing is living a righteous life and not harming others. Taking each and every step to do good and justice to one another. 6. Islam is about respecting the rights of Allah and respecting the rights of the creation of Allah. Do not give in to personal desires and fatwas suiting oneself and simply live your life to please Allah alone. Buy Islamic books by modern Muslims (such as Mufti Menk) and spend your time meditating and praying to Allah. Use the five prayers to reveal your heart to Allah. Do not be persuaded by expensive money grabbing Sheikh or silly books that do nothing for your relationship with Allah. Man made law and rulings are simply that just man made! 7.	You will be so much happier leaving behind all the nonsense that you never agreed with and all the non stop pressure to follow fatwas that have nothing to do with bringing you peace let alone closer to Allah. Decide from this moment you are a progressive and modern Muslim you will leave behind inequality of women and oppression of men. Life is not about rules and regulations it is about doing good deeds not learning endless Arabic you don't understand or having books tell you that women get it easy but men must slave away like fire on earth. Be free, be happy be a modern progressive Muslim! Enter into real spiritual bliss and happiness

Play a lot of tennis. To teach something, you must at least do it well. Playing tournaments is the best way to keep getting better. If you don't have time for competition, at least work on all strokes 4 hours a week. 2. Get your equipment. Besides business cards you will need 2 rackets (in case you break strings) a ball hopper or basket that stands upright and can hold at least 50 balls, cones, pen and paper, sun-block, sun-glasses, hat and tennis attire. 3. Study. Playing tennis is only half the job. You need to learn how to teach it. Your clients will be expecting their money's worth so you have to know how to manage the lesson time to get your points across and for the student to practice what you are teaching. The more you study the game of tennis and different teaching methods the more likely you are to find out how to get across a specific client. Keep up with leagues and tournaments in your area and keep up with USTA rules and regulations. 4. Put your name out there. No one is going to know you are a tennis instructor unless you tell them. Every time you meet someone introduce yourself as a coach and give them your card. Also, tell everyone you know that you coach all the time even if you don't. You never know, maybe even an ex-girlfriend (bf) has a passion for tennis you never knew about. 5. Find courts where you can teach at. Many high schools, middle schools and colleges in the U.S. have tennis courts and you can teach there at certain times. Make sure to ask for permission if the courts do not seem to be open to the public. Be sure to know when is convenient in each location as well as lighting issues and court conditions. 6. Hang out at the most busy public courts of the city. Just like fish in water you should be very comfortable being around tennis players and facilities. Watch a person or group of people playing, imagine you are giving a private lesson to one of the persons or a group lesson to the whole group. List drills or exercises you would give them and what they would accomplish. Also what tips and metaphors you would use to make them better. 7. Talk about tennis. After you get comfortable being at the facilities start talking to the people often. Let them know that you are a coach and that you would love the opportunity to help them with their game. Do not be too pushy but rather interested in their game and excited to be talking about the sport. Compliments are always a good way to start a tennis conversation. 8. Dress like a pro. Image is everything, and tennis is a sport that has some of the coolest looking sportswear. It doesn't have to be expensive but it must be tennis attire. There is nothing worse than a tennis coach wearing running shoes. Always carry extra shirts in case you get too sweaty and do your best to keep clean and wrinkle free. Also, if you always look like a tennis player people will associate tennis with you and that's always good for business. 9. Say no to playing but yes to teaching. When you start becoming a tennis coach a lot of people will ask you to play with them for fun. You don't have to be rude about it but be sure to let them know that your time on the court is valuable and it's how you make your living. You can always offer them a discount on the first lesson or something of the like to keep that person as a client. Also, say yes to teaching. Saying no to lessons is the fastest way to loose clients. 10. Start enjoying the fruit of your work. You are now a tennis coach, enjoy being outside and make your work fun. Be open to all kinds of people and personalities because you will meet all kinds.	A coach is sometimes a very influential person in people's lives and they will respect you if you respect your work.

Decide where you can cut back. This is probably the most cautious and most effective beginning point for any established business in terms of starting to go green and it can start saving your company money fairly quickly, giving you incentive to keep going. Some suggestions for getting started include: * Observe what your business uses and wastes, such as energy, supplies and other materials. Make sure you look at all aspects of your business and start a list of areas where you can cut down. * Look at the company's paper usage. How much paper does your business use daily? Can you cut down on your paper use? Try switching to digital procedures to invoice your clients and pay your bills. Scan in important contracts and email them rather than printing them and putting them in the mail. Discourage staff in your office from printing every email or even other documentation.	Encourage them to read on screen––it's a skill, not a talent, and one that each person can learn. When printing is necessary, use both sides of the paper. To make sure people remember this, it's helpful if you set your printer to automatically print double sided. You can also program your fax machine not to print out confirmation pages.

When this happens, take a close look at what is happening and see how you can rejuvenate the motivation and energy that has gone awry. * Keep checking resources, savings and costs. Rein in any costs that are not warranted or that are harming the company. Sometimes you may just need to wait a little longer before implementing the next step.

Consider electric power supply if planning on using an Electric powered Pump system. It will need to be on a GFI (Ground Fault Interrupted) Breaker in the Electrical Panel or a GFI plug in near the Pump location. Also, consider if any Pond underwater or Pond edge low voltage night lighting is to be installed. THIS MUST BE 100% WATERPROOF CONNECTIONS! CONSULT AND\OR HIRE LICENSED ELECTRICIAN There is a variety of Solar Powered Pumps on the market and be sure the Pump will meet or exceed the Pumping requirements you are wanting to achieve. 3. Circulate all the water in the Pond at least twice in an hour. There is nothing more unsightly or displeasing than a dirty, smelly Pond in the yard. 4. Clear the ""pond area"" from anything that is on top of it. Branches, leaves, grass, everything must go. 5. Mark outline of pond shape edges using Marking Paint, a rope or even a Garden Hose will work. Start digging rough outline edges first so that the outline will be established. Pay special attention to drainage and overflow flooding when choosing the location. 6. Dig the hole. Begin digging the hole. It can be as deep as you want, but it's recommended to not do it too deep as it will look dark and not as shiny, but everyone has his/her own likes/dislikes. 7. It's recommended that the pond be fairly shallow in case a small child or pet gets into the pond and be able to get out or stand in it. Plan on digging shelves in the side walls all the way around the pond to not only aid a child, pet or even an Adult in getting out but the shelf will also provide plant ledges and Gravel\Rock bottom placement. 8. During excavation a water level below the Pond edge will have to be established not only for Pond water level during use but for any type of filtration to be used such as a 'Skimmer' style inlet. Also if a Waterway\Waterfall is built into Pond there needs to be enough room in the Pond to hold the water that is being pumped down Waterway for holding purposes or it will overfill the Pond when shut off causing flooding. Also. there should be room in the Pond to hold a heavy Rain event or it may overfill Pond as well and cause flooding. Consideration of flooding and drainage is also to be taken into design considerations. 9. Set a layer of plant terrace, then border shelf, then sand with newspapers (or just sand)and then pond liner. The key here is to provide a smooth bottom for the liner so not to be punctured causing leaks. 10. A person can also purchase an underlayment material where they purchase the Pond Liner and a good underlayment is highly recommended especially in rocky ground that may puncture the Pond Liner. It's not recommended to use old carpet as the toxins in the carpet could 'Foul' the Pond. 11. Make sure the Pond liner is 3 to 4 ft (at least) bigger on all edges of the actual Pond dimensions. This is because when the Pond liner is laid in the Pond it will settle A LOT shrinking it after all the Gravel\Rock and water fill the Pond. Ideally, the Pond liner should extend up and over the edges when finished settling by at least 2 ft. If the liner is pulled down into Pond it will leak. 12. The pond liner makes the whole thing waterproof so that the water won't get absorbed into the earth below. 13. Set your water pump on top of the pond liner in the lowest part of Pond or even dig a 'Pump Well' in bottom of Pond before Pond liner goes in and camouflage it with some big stones. 14. If installing a 'Skimmer' type filtration system inlet at opposite end of Pump location in Pond, piping from filter to Pump will need to be installed and hidden either in dirt around Pond edge or under water along a shelf. The key here is to not undersize this piping and it has to be at least the size of the Pump inlet fitting. 15. Then, make a pvc duct or piping (or any duct of your like) that gets out of the pond, try to hide that too. Flexible piping or correct size tubing works well also. This is the outlet from Pump and if building a Waterway\Waterfall the Pump Specs must meet the required 'Feet of Head' to pump that distance. 16. Connect the piping from filter into Pump inlet and keeping it hidden using Gravel\Rocks, and\or Plants, or Driftwood etc.Make sure that the water will go back into the pond once pumped. 17. After taking shoes off or making sure everyone helping is wearing flat, soft soled shoes to not puncture Pond liner begin placing bigger Rocks in bottom of Pond and up the sides. Be careful placing all material on liner or it may puncture and leak. Carefully add smaller gravel by the shovel or bucket full and DO NOT just dump wheelbarrow loads onto liner. Place Plants leaving them in the pots at desired locations. Be very careful stepping in and out of the Pond on the liner and it is recommended that one or two people say in the Pond and handed materials to be placed by others from the outside. Fill with water and if need be drain water from Pond a few times if really murky from installed material. 18."	Hopefully your calculations on liner dimensions were correct and there is plenty up and over the Pond edge. It is well worth the few extra dollars spent on liner to have more than enough than not. The underlayment (if used) and liner will settle for about a week overall.

It is often recommended that women should drink no more than one drink per day, and men should have no more than two drinks per day. While it is not recommended that abstainers begin drinking alcohol, scientific studies have shown that the consumption of one or two drinks per day by healthy adults may be associated with a reduction in total mortality as well as a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular and related diseases . Wine and beer have shown more benefits than other forms of alcohol.	Pregnant and nursing women must never drink alcohol as even tiny amounts are very harmful to the fetus and nursing infants. Alcohol is also especially harmful to children and those too young to drink. For healthy adults who do drink regularly, one drink may be better than two, and more than two or three drinks can drastically increase mortality as well as the incidence of certain debilitating and lethal diseases. If you are a healthy adult who already drinks alcoholic beverages, follow these steps to make sure that you don’t drink more than two servings of alcoholic beverages per day.

If you find you can't sleep with music playing, turn the volume to low, think of something you love, and just rest. If no music comforts you at all, turn it off. You can also sit up and listen to the music. Finding a quiet place where you can listen to some relaxing music, which usually will be classical music, can also help you unwind. If you use mediation or are thinking of trying mediation, quiet relaxing music often helps in that department (mediation can also help you relax at the end of the day as it's prime purpose is to quiet the mind, allowing the body to rest). 5. Keep it dark in your room. Lights onset your internal clock to awake when you should be asleep. If you keep it dark in your room you'll find yourself asleep 10x faster. 6. Keep the room at a good temperature. Make sure the room is the comfortable temperature for you. The human body during rest hour should be comfortable around 48-70 degrees in a room. If it's too hot, keep the window cracked or use a fan. If it's too cold, use a space heater or an extra blanket. 7. Don't think. If you let yourself think about day-to-day activities your only setting yourself up for another hour of laying restlessly. Instead, relax everything. From your eye's behind your eyelids, your tongue, your feet, everything."

Favor technique over weight. With any shoulder exercises you do, the correct form will build muscle mass faster than if you keep piling on weight with sloppy form. Over time, doing exercises with poor technique may result in strain or injury. * If you're exercising in a gym, get a trainer or experienced weightlifter to critique your form before you develop any bad habits. * If you plan to work out at a home gym, you still may want to have a personal trainer or experienced friend come by and check out your technique, especially if these are new exercises to you. 2. Lift seated rather than standing. It is much easier to isolate your deltoids and work them harder when you're in a seated position. When you're standing, you may find that you're using secondary muscle groups, rather than letting your shoulders do the work. * Standing lifts engage your core and lower body, making them better whole body exercises. But especially if you're just starting out, you may find it easier to perfect your form from a seated position first. 3. Check your grip. If you're lifting a barbell rather than dumbbells, where you place your hands on the bar determines which muscles are engaged. * Keep your grip wider on the bar, with your hands a little wider than shoulder-width apart. * If your grip is narrow, with your hands closer together, you won't isolate the deltoids as well because the muscles in your arms, upper back, and chest will be doing most of the work. 4. Enlist a spotter for heavier weights. You want to use the heaviest possible weights you can if you want to build muscle mass.	.

Decide which size lantern and color led lights you would like to use - * Ball Jars and other glass jars can come in a variety of sizes, this can make for a fun design or a larger amount of light. You can also choose from different color LED lights that will be powered by the solar energy you are collecting. 2. To begin, purchase or collect all necessary items for building your solar lantern(these items can be purchased online at store.sundancesolar.com - You will need the following items to build the solar lantern, these include - * 1 - 3V 70mA polycrystalline solar panel with wires * 1- Circuit board (pcb) with dusk/dawn operation with 2 LED’s * 1- Battery holder for 2 AAA batteries * 2- 1AAA NiMH rechargeable batteries * 4 - wire nuts * \- Gorilla Glue(weatherproof and relatively inexpensive) * \- Wire stripper and cutter * 1 - Glass ball jar(Wide mouth size is preferable) 3. Once you have collected all the necessary parts, arrange them neatly on a table and take note of what everything is and what every part will do. familiarize yourself with the parts as this will make it easier for you to build the lantern. 4. First If your wires are too long, which they might be, you can cut them down to a shorter length. A good recommend length to work with is 2-3 inches for all the black and red wires. - Insert the ends of the wires where the cutter portion is on the wire cutter and cut like normal scissors. 5. Then re-strip the end of the wires to expose the wire itself. To do this insert the newly cut end you just cut into the correct diameter stripping hole below where the cutting blade is. It should either be the 1 or .75 for this size wire. Try each and when you grip the handles, pull the wire back and the wire stripper should remove the plastic covering the wire. If it doesn't strip, you need to make sure you have the wire in the correct sized hole. 6. Take you battery holder and install two AAA batteries. Install them like normal batteries: + goes with + and - goes with - 7. Take one grey wire nut and connect the two RED wires together from the battery holder to the circuit board where it is marked BATTERY. After you twist clockwise to tighten the wires together you can pull wire nut off. Your wire ends should be wrapped together creating a secure electrical bond - * It is very important you connect it to the battery section of the circuit! 8. Repeat step 3 with one wire nut and connect the two BLACK wires from the battery holder to the circuit board - It is very important you connect it to the battery section of the circuit! 9. Poke a large enough hole through your ball jar lid. The hole should be large enough for the two black and red wires coming from the solar panel to fit through. the hole should also be made about a 1/2in off the edge of the lip of the lid. This will allow the panel to lay flat on the top and will also make sure you can glue the battery holder on the other side of the lid. 10. String the red and black wires from the solar panel through the hole so that you can connect the wires with the circuit board. 11. Connect the two RED wires with a wire nut from the solar panel to the circuit board where it is marked SOLAR. After you twist clockwise to tighten the wires together you can pull wire nut off. Your wire ends should be wrapped together creating a secure electrical bond. - Like steps 3 and 4 it is important to connect these wires to their correct destination! 12. Repeat step 5 connecting the two black wires from the solar panel to the circuit board where it is marked SOLAR 13. Test your light - Your LED lights should now be on. They are currently running off the battery power as your circuit board is set to battery as the default mode. If your lights do not come on check to make sure the tiny switches on the circuit board are in the ""on"" position which is towards the center of the board. Also check to make sure your wires are all connected properly. 14. Install all parts. Glue the battery holder and circuit board together by applying a small amount of glue to the bottom of the circuit board and pressing it to the top(where the batteries are not facing) of the battery holder. 15."	Apply a small amount of the instant glue to the batteries and press the now combined circuit board and battery holder to the bottom of the lid. Hold until it stays on its own.

Help your child learn to communicate. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing have multiple ways of communicating, and your child will want to do what works best for them. Ideally, your child should have more than one way of communicating so that they can fully access the meaning of texts. * Children who are able to use a hearing aid may learn to speak. Since they won’t hear sounds perfectly, help them learn to sound out words. * Your child may learn to read lips, now called speechreading, even if they also use a hearing aid. * Your child may decide to use sign language. If they do, it’s important that they are able to use it frequently. * You can also cue your child by showing them visual examples of what you want to communicate to them. For example, you could mimic pouring juice into a cup to ask the if they want juice. * Allow your child to make choices about how they want to communicate. Don’t force your child to do something because it works better for you. 2. Learn sign language. If your child signs, learning to sign so that you can communicate with them will increase their learning potential. Sign language is structured differently than English, so children need immersion to be fully bilingual. It can be tempting to rely on speechreading/lipreading for communication, but your child’s signing skills will be stronger if you sign with them. 3. Use visual cues. Support your child’s language development by using visual aids, which can include physical items or pictures. Show your child reference items, and work with your child's teacher to boost their understanding of the cues. * For example, you could imitate eating to tell your child that it’s time for dinner. * You could also show your child cards with pictures on it.	.

Think about demanding the elimination of things that a government need not do at all -- like these: * Telling Americans what non-violent belief, organization or church they may, must or must not belong to -- or to punish or harass Americans for belonging to a particular church or ideology, regardless of the size of that program or the scope of the law. * Pushing any proposal because of its smaller size when it is still not acceptable even if its small or done at a lower cost. * Control of personal rights by the government. That is why the Bill of Rights states that ""Congress shall make no law..."" in these regards; it does not say that some laws are good. So would you or would you not support: * Socialized business -- * Higher taxes and fees on factories -- * Federal government-imposed school curriculum -- *"	Sometimes standards are needed, but government is not the best source of these for business.

Be_a_Pregnant_Vegan.txt	Begin_Revision	0.819	### Getting More Vitamin B12, DHA, and Iodine	240	So do n't go overboard .	### Getting More Vitamin B12, DHA, and Iodine	328	Do n't go overboard .	<delete><So><1>|||<replace><do><2><Do><1>	True	Getting More Vitamin B12, DHA, and Iodine  1. Take a vitamin B12 supplement. A pregnant woman should have 2.6 micrograms of vitamin B12 per day. The downside of vitamin B12 is that it is present only in animal foods. As a result, most vegetarians are deficient in this important nutrient. You can still get enough of it through supplements and fortified foods. * Possible sources of this vitamin include soya drinks and fortified cereals that are used for breakfast like cornflakes. * Vitamin B12 is important in the body because it works together with folic acid in helping with the fetal development and helping in the formation of red blood cells because there is increased requirement of blood for the baby and the mother. * The mother is encouraged to watch out for signs of decreased vitamin B12 such as pale skin, bleeding gums and weakness. 2. Get adequate DHA. DHA is essential for normal development of your baby’s brain and vision. These hormones are extremely important for fetal growth. Although the chief sources of DHA (and iodine) is seafood you can use supplements to add them to your vegan diet. * DHA is present in plant foods such as flaxseeds, walnuts, almonds, canola oil, and soya beans. * Vegan DHA supplements prepared from microalgae are also available in health food stores. * Additionally, most folate supplements come enriched with DHA these days. You can opt for such supplements to make sure you get enough DHA. 3. Get your iodine, too. Iodine is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism in the mother and baby. This can also lead to fetal abnormalities such as mental retardation. Again, the chief source is seafood, but you can get it through seasonings and supplements, too. * Make sure you have iodized salt for seasonings and cooking to avoid iodine deficiency. However, the recommended salt intake is 2300 mg &ndash; which is only one teaspoon! Too much and it could increase your blood pressure.	.

Get yourself some Chiefs clothes. Jerseys, T-shirts, coats, and jackets are all good. You can buy them at the games, or in stores around Kansas City and the surrounding region. If you do not live in the Midwest, NFL.com sells Chiefs products as well. 2. Watch the games either in person or on television. They are always televised locally and occasionally on national TV. Tickets to home games are not very cheap (but not too expensive, either) and can be hard to get. But if you are able to attend a game personally, it is a very unique experience. 3. Here are some things and words to know: * Arrowhead Stadium. The field where the team plays all their home games. It is a large stadium, seating over 79,000 people at one time. It is also famous for being the loudest outdoor stadium in the world due to overly enthusiastic Chiefs fans. * KC Wolf. The mascot for the Chiefs. He is a wolf, possibly best known for his tackling of a drunk fan who jumped onto the field during a 2007 regular season game. It has become an internet phenomenon on YouTube. * Dallas Texans. The Chiefs were originally from Texas before moving to KC in 1959, ten years before the Royals. * Truman Sports Complex. The sports facility that includes both Arrowhead and the Royals' Kauffman Stadium. * Clark Hunt. The owner of the franchise, son of Lamar Hunt, the former Chiefs owner (owned franchise 1959-2006) who formed the NFL's American League. * Scott Pioli. The Chiefs GM, replacing Carl Peterson who had been the GM from 1989-2008. * Andy Ried. The current head coach (2013-present) and former Eagles head coach. He replaced coach Romeo Crennel, who coached the team in 2012. * Alex Smith. The current quarterback (QB) for the Chiefs. He led the 49ers in 2012 before suffering a concussion during a game against the St. Louis Rams, in which Colin Kapernick replaced him, and led the 49ers to the Super Bowl, which they eventually lost to the Ravens. * Dwayne Bowe. The Chiefs number one WR. He had consecutive seasons in his rookie and sophomore seasons but his 2009 season was derailed by a 4-game suspension. * Jamaal Charles. The bright new Chiefs running back. He succeeded the controversial Larry Johnson. Following Johnson's release halfway though the season, Charles became the starting RB and rushed for having started only 8 games. He averaged more yards per carry since week 9 than every running back in the NFL except Chris Johnson of the Titans 4. Learn the history: * The 1960s The Chiefs were originally the Dallas Texans. Dallas could not support two teams (the other being the Cowboys), so the Texans moved to Kansas City and were renamed. The Chiefs appeared in the first Super Bowl (1966-1967), but lost 35-10 against the Green Bay Packers. They returned to the Super Bowl in 1969-1970. Led by Hall of Fame QB Len Dawson, they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 23-7. They soon developed a heated rivalry with the Oakland Raiders that is still alive today. * The 1970s and 1980s: During the 1970s the aging Super Bowl team could not perform well enough, and were replaced with a new generation of players.	They returned to mediocrity for the remainder of the 1980s.

Decide on the right car for you. You should always try to get what you want, but have a backup plan. There are many sources such as Consumer Reports Car Buying Guide, car complaints.com, J.D. Power, US News and World Report, and a host of others. Try using a variety of sources when researching a particular vehicle or vehicles. Remember that highly rated cars command premium prices. A lower rated car can be a gold mine if you can put up with a design flaw or two. * Consider a car with fewer options or an alternate make and model. For instance, Lincoln is a luxury version of Mercury. The Lincoln model will have more features and luxury items included. Various models may have deluxe trim packages such as leather seats, enhanced stereo systems, etc. If you are trying to save money, stay away from features that promote a higher price tag. 2. Research the make and model you are considering. Study consumer reviews, compare Kelley Blue Book values, Edmunds Book values, NADA Guides, etc. Research resale values and conduct vehicle history reports with VIN numbers (you can use vindecoder.com to determine if the car you are looking at is in fact the car you are looking at). Keep in mind, most sites like carfax.com are not free sites. Most good legitimate sellers will have a Carfax or some other form of report listed with the car. If they don't, or they refuse to furnish a copy of a vehicle history report, stay away! If there are any particular issues or recalls with the model you're looking at, you may avoid serious issues by doing your research ahead of time (carcomplaints.com is an excellent unbiased source of information). 3. Use an online calculator to figure out payments. Don't dwell on price just yet; consider how long you will keep the car, what an affordable payment is for your budget, and how much you can put down. Consider a brand new car instead of a used car, if it has subvention financing (a manufacturer's reduced financing rate). * Stay away from dealer financing! The most lucrative department at any car dealership is the finance division! The way they make their money is like this: your credit score is run. The credit score determines what kind of APR they can give you. That APR is ""adjusted"" so that the dealership makes their money off the spread. They can do this because they do not have to tell you what you are pre-approved for! 4. Strongly consider, if possible, buying outright. The absence of monthly payments can have a wonderful effect on your finances. 5. Determine what you can pay. When you attempt to buy a used car, you need to consider what (if any) down payment you can make, how much you can afford for monthly payments, and how much insurance premiums are going to cost you on your used car purchase. If your insurance is likely to double, you need to budget this in so you're not extending yourself by agreeing to a monthly payment that is too high. Take into account fuel economy and maintenance costs. These expenses can vary greatly depending on the vehicle. 6. Establish financing options. Banks are typically willing to offer financing on a used car. However, some banks refuse to finance a used car that is six years old or older. If your bank will work with you on financing, this may be the wisest decision. Banks or credit unions typically offer lower interest rates than dealerships."	By letting the dealership know the interest rate you have negotiated with the bank, you may get a lower offer from the dealership.

Classes are important; they are why you are in school in the first place. But too much focus on academics can make you stressed or even, sometimes, depressed.  * Do things to keep yourself healthy and in good spirits. Consider joining an extra-curricular activity. An active social life can be a great release and give you a much needed break from studying. * Eat right and exercise. It may sound strange, but we now know that there are clear links between diet, exercise, and high cognitive performance in children as well as adults. The right food and regular exercise will prime you for learning. *	Friends can help you catch up when you are absent on a particular day, but they are also invaluable for your overall well-being. Family, too. There will probably be times when you’ll need to lean on them for moral support.

Then you put it on at the back the machine and rests on the floor. 5. Then you check the hose that goes from the squeegee to the waste water tank, to make sure that there are no extra holes in it. There is a hole in top of the tank that needs to be checked every time the machine is used. That hole has to stay clean of anything that will plug it up. 6. Next you check the drain hose to make sure that it is not plugged, cracked, or ripped. The drain hose is located at the front of the machine just below the clean water tank. 7. Next you check the brushes to make sure that they are not broken. Broken brushes need to be replaced or fixed. 8.

Gather relevant documentation. You should have some form of valid government-issued ID for the application. Younger applicants might also need a birth certificate to verify their age. Those who have been married before should bring their divorce decree, though it is not required. 2. Apply with the probate court to marry under the age of 18. If either you or your fiancé are under the age of 18, the minor must obtain an order from either a probate or district court where the minor lives. You will need to fill out an application and bring it with you to court. The minor will also need to be escorted to the City Clerk by a parent to apply for a license. 3. Finalize all divorces. You must wait at least one day after your divorce is finalized to apply for a Marriage Intention. However, in Massachusetts it takes 90 days for a divorce to become final. If you enter the application before the divorce is finalized you will need to apply again. You will also be required to pay the fee a second time. 4. Collect necessary information.

Business Startup Mistake  1 - Not Creating the Business System. Starting a business throws up many opportunities and challenges on a daily basis. You are both head chef and chief bottle washer; creating the vision, devising your sales and marketing strategy, raising sufficient finance to fund the businesses growth etc. Now, add devising a whole business system into the mix and you’re gonna be knee-deep in a whole lotta challenges. One way of looking at is asking yourself would you be better off investing time and money into building a pipeline (i.e. a system) rather than hauling buckets (i.e. no system). A lot of entrepreneurs have not worked in large systemised business or franchise operation before so they find it very testing and almost impossible to devise and implement a business system. Most small businesses are therefore hauling buckets. The whole purpose of creating a business system is to allow you to create a business that will quickly run itself without your own day-to-day involvement. For most small business owners this is merely a pipe dream. The reason this happens is that not enough time is invested up front devising the systems to run the business.	Read The E-Myth by Michael Gerber to help your find out more about what’s involved in creating your own business system. Finally, rather than trying to build a business system you may want to consider buying a franchise instead.

When you're doing your hair make you're, make sure you lift it of the back of your neck as it may get very hot and sweaty. A popular hairstyle is leaving your bangs/fringe out and putting some of your hair behind in a pony tail. 3. Instead of wearing black skinny jeans, band t-shirts and converse, buy some knee high socks (black & purple, red & black, black & white... etc) and choose a skirt that will match them, whether it be black, red or white. Any type of t-shirt whether its a band or a normal one will match.	.

Visit the makeup counter, Test out products at Ulta.	If you don't know, ask a sister, an honest bff or someone who will tell you the truth. Avoid lipstick unless you are a senior. The reason is, people won't take you serious if you are a freshman wearing bright red lipstick. Seniors can get away with it because they are practically college students. Otherwise, stick to colored lip gloss or colored lip balm.

Always, always, always stay positive. Believe that you can be a good mom, and you will. Believe that your baby is going to be a good baby, and they will. :) 2. Don't freak out if you make a mistake or accidentally bump your babies head, and don't let your spouse freak out either. Everything will be ok. Try to worry less and have faith. 3. In regards to feeding with a bottle, it's OK to prop the bottle up on a blanket, so you have your hands free and get some chores done. The baby will not choke. He/she will be perfectly fine. Sometimes this can be a nice break to get things done. 4. Remember to use diaper rash cream often. Sometimes babies resist diaper changing time or are extra fussy because they have a rash. 5. When switching to milk from formula, make sure you mix the formula with milk and slowly wean your baby off of the formula. If you don't do this, they will be very constipated and unhappy. Constipation happens with an abrupt change in diet, so make transitions in food slow and easy. 6. Make sure you are living by either your mom or your mother in law. Make it happen somehow. You will NEED their help. You have to have breaks, even if it's just going to Target by yourself, baby free, once a week. Try to get them to babysit once a week so you can relax and remember the peace of life before you had all this responsibility. 7. Make sure you still do things with your spouse and don't let the baby consume all your time. It's easy for a spouse to get jealous of a new baby, but if you still do things together, that will help. 8. If you used to go to church every Sunday, don't stress yourself out too much if you can't make it to Sunday church anymore. You can always watch online church services, or go to a mid week Bible study when your mom or mother in law are watching the baby. Don't be legalistic and force yourself to go out when you know the baby might have a very hard time in the nursery. Have grace with yourself. 9. Lastly, remember to have fun and enjoy your new baby. Don't just take care of him or her. Play with them, laugh with them, makes faces and noises at them etc. Take lots of pictures. Dress them up in tons of cute outfits. Learn to enjoy this time because it goes by super, super fast.	.

Stay positive at all times. Your or your spouse being negative about anything will discourage you and more importantly, the baby develops its psyche under whatever conditions. So, be careful what you say about yourself and your baby. Reasonably happy parents make for a better-adjusted smiling baby. * Believe that you can be a good mom, and you will be. Believe that your baby is going to be a good baby, and he or she will be, or at least you will ensure that he/she will be. 2. Try to remain calm at all times. To worry about anything drains your energy. Worrying does not solve any problems. It makes the problems seem bigger than they really are. * If your baby gets a fever, for example, try to not worry right away that he/she will get brain damage etc. Most fevers go away after about 24 hours. Just give your baby some baby Tylenol, mixed in her formula or water, and everything will most likely be ok.	.

As you know what is the importance of “Muscles” and ”Money” in everyones life, let’s talk about the similarity between them and why should we start build them early. 2. Well…when you are a kid or when you are a teenager, you are full of energy, you are far away from any mental pressure other than to get good grades (oh yes, you can’t get rid of nightmares of bad grades) and having rapport among friends and other gender. This is the best time to utilize your energy in playing outdoor sports. Any sport which pumps up your heartbeat and increase your pulse rate will eventually help to build muscles.	This is the time when body is still in development phase more you push the limits more you grow your muscles. This is the time when you can even challenge your gene, irrespective of gene you carried from your parents; you can make some changes how your body shape will grow in future. Any high intensity sport is great. It doesn’t matter if you play cricket, soccer, tennis or swim. And if money is really a problem for you to afford any of these sports then just run run and run (although there is less fun in that). Muscles can be built by running, pushups, chin ups or any aerobics and body resistance training outdoor exercises. It doesn’t require any fancy setup. Only special need is your determination and a clear goal to invest in your body for future returns.

Study the Victorian and 18th Century French life style for inspiration and combine elements you like into your everyday life. These are good sources if you don't want to borrow ideas from multiple outfits specifically called ""lolita"". 2. Read the novel, manga and movies versions of Kamikaze girls.The main character Momoko is a lifestyle Lolita. read other books and magazines, as well as visit sites on Lolita etiquette and mannerisms. 3. Try to build your Lolita wardrobe. Places like ""Anna House"" and ""In the Starlight"" are wonderful for those on a budget, as well as other Indie shops which carry Lolita. Ebay is not recommended as, quite often the stores won't use their own photographs, and you will get a bad item. 4. You should try to have multiple skirts, jumper skirts, blouses, a good pair of Mary Jane shoes which are practical for everyday life and Lolita specific undergarments if you feel the need. Black or white Mary Janes are good for most clothes, though if your clothes are centered around the color pink, pink Mary Janes would be nice. 5. Now that you have your basic outfits focus on getting a parasol and such. You can't really have one black parasol and one white parasol without looking ""ita-lolita"". This requires a parasol with an identical or similar pattern to that of the dress you are going to wear today. 6. Invest in a few essential items. These include (but are not limited to) a white blouse and/or a black blouse (depending on what style your wardrobe is leaning towards), one or two full skirts, a good petticoat, bloomers, and knee-high or over-the-knee socks. Never under-the-knee. Blouses vary with style, for sweet you may want a peter pan collar, for classic you may want a high collar. Other elements to look for in a blouse are a nice, tailored look, puff or cap sleeves, a bib or yoke, pintucks, ruffles or a decent amount of lace, and perhaps a neck bow if you wish. The skirts must be around knee length and full enough to fit a petticoat underneath."	In order to get the right silhouette, the skirt must sit at the natural waist. After you have these, expand into other colors than black and white. Red, pink, light and dark blue, brown and floral patterns are common. A good petticoat is NOTHING like a square dancing petticoat. A-Line or Bell shaped is recommended. Hoop skirts and light slips will not fill out the skirt correctly.

Think of a great idea. If a great idea comes to you, evaluate if it is realistic. Think of cost, manufacturing time, and popularity. Ask and record if people would actually buy the product. If you don't have an idea yet, it is a good start to think of your target market first. Then brainstorm a list of things like places they shop, things they like, and things you like. Narrow the list down to about three items, keeping cost, manufacturing time, and popularity in mind. Find the easiest, most realistic product.Or, think of a terrible idea.

Does the world need yet another search engine?""&mdash;but many less-spectacular successes have strong arguments against them. There is always a good reason against a good idea.

Early-stage investors know that great people can make a mediocre idea work, but mediocre people can't make a great idea work.""&mdash;Don Dodge. 2. Write a business plan. Include details and descriptions, and plan everything out realistically. Take your time and evaluate your product at each section. The sections of a good business plan include: * Product description: develop your product. What will it look like? What materials will you need? Make your product eye-catching. * Market Analysis: Who is your market? Where do they shop? Where are they located? * Competition: Who is your competition? What are their strengths? How will you beat them? * Marketing: How will you market your product? What kind of image do you want to display? Where will you advertise? What is your tagline? What is your packaging like? * Sales: Where will you sell? How will you get your customers to buy? When will you sell? What is your estimated sales forecast? * Manufacturing: How do you make your product? Explain this in detailed steps. What materials do you need to make your product? When and where will you manufacture? What is your COGS (cost of goods sold)? * Finance: how much money do you need to start your business? What is your gross profit?Or, don't write a business plan. A business plan is a work of fiction, anyway. If you don't have much experience in business, or the market is new and unknown, a business plan might be a waste of time, or, worse, a path to self-delusion. ""In all my years in startups and all my work with VCs I don't ever recall seeing a written business plan. The fact is that investors do not read them.""&mdash;Don Dodge. Plan just enough to make your first sale. The main thing is to make at least one customer happy, and complete the entire cycle of ""make product, sell product"" as quickly as possible. Then you will have a business, and then you might be in a position to understand some problems of the sort that extensive planning can help solve. 3. Pitch your idea to Venture Capitalists to get money to start your company. If you have a good idea, they will love to invest their money in your company. Make a PowerPoint presentation explaining why your product is the best, including each part of your business plan in the presentation. Tell them how much your estimated gross profit is and how much percentage of that they will earn in interest.Or, don't look for or accept funding. Striking a deal with venture capitalists is a long, tiresome, difficult, and dangerous process. In the early days of a business, it can be a catastrophic distraction. ""Distraction is fatal to start-ups.""&mdash;Paul Graham. Many VCs are not set up to make you successful. A wonderful success for you might be to earn $80,000 a year doing work you love. Starting small and pleasing a small number of customers at first is a high-probability way to get there. A VC will not allow such a success to happen, because a VC's strategy is to become a billionaire by rolling the dice on many low-probability but potentially gigantic-returning businesses. The price you pay for taking on a VC is control: control of your dream. If you can get the business started without spending a lot of money, that might be your best route. 4. Sell. Sell and distribute your product. If you're getting revenue, then you're in business. You're testing your theories about the market, you're finding out what really works and what doesn't, and you're getting fuel for more ideas and improvements. If you're not getting revenue, then it's all in your head. 5. Hang out with entrepreneurs. By meeting entrepreneurs socially, you gain contacts and hear about opportunities."	You pick up their attitudes, their nose for opportunity, the great diversity in their styles.

Understand the power of your attitude toward yourself and views about yourself. How you perceive yourself, how you talk about yourself, and how you represent yourself eventually become the reality for you. And if it happens that you're putting yourself down, belittling your worth, and making light of your talents in the face of others, then you will come across as self-effacing, low in self-esteem, and almost a part of the wallpaper. This isn't humility, it's self-denial and an attempt to lessen your presence. On the other hand, if you exaggerate your qualities, talents, and skills, you'll come across as egotistical and arrogant but oddly enough, this is not about over-estimating your self-worth but about deceiving yourself through insecurity. There is a middle pathway and it is the one in which you recognize and celebrate the fact that you are a valuable person, equal to everyone else, and that your talents and thoughts are unique and worthy. Getting to this belief can be difficult if you have spent years underestimating your worth but it is always possible to change your thoughts and to learn to value yourself. 2. Learn to overcome a fear of self-love. Self-love is often equated with narcissism, egotism, and some kind of one-way trip to introversion. This is probably partly because the English language has a hard time dealing with the word ""love"" – it has to cover a lot of territory for the many different types of love out there. It is also mired in the confusion people feel about the messaging to do good unto others, to always be charitable, and to give, give, give, of oneself. While these are noble intentions, they can often be taken out of proportion and used to downplay putting one's own needs and wants beneath those of others out of a fear of being perceived as selfish or inward-looking. Again, this is about getting the balance right. * Healthy self love is about being your own best friend. Self love is expressed not through preening oneself all day and constantly announcing how great you are (those are signs of intense insecurity); rather, self love is about treating yourself with the same care, tolerance, generosity, and compassion as you would treat a special friend. * Treat yourself with care, compassion, and respect. * Avoid overlaying how you think other people see you; how does it help you to capitulate to their idea of you? Only you can give yourself the esteem boost needed. * Self love falters when we fall into the realm of addiction. Alcoholism, drug addiction, internet addiction, and all similar addictions are a sign that you're hurting deeply but also that you don't want to face up to the opportunities presented by working through your pain. 3. Trust your own feelings. Self-worth requires that you learn to listen to and rely upon your own feelings and not automatically respond to the feelings of other people. Once those around you establish that you'll respond to what they want, they lack any incentive to not make use of your responsiveness, and that sets a bind for you that can be hard to break (but break it you must). When you trust your own feelings, you will realize that when demands are placed upon you, you don't feel great and you will want to respond with what works better for you, or for both of you, rather than what works better for everyone else except you. * Self-worth plummets when we let others make decisions for us. Initially this may seem like the easy route and one that allows you to avoid hard choices. Ultimately though, it turns into the hard route because you will always find yourself boxed in by what other people decide for you. And then suddenly, if the people who make decisions for you disappear from your life, you are left alone and indecisive. That is a very earth-shattering place to end up in and it's more likely than not to happen if you're not prepared to make decisions for yourself. 4. Analyze yourself. Many of us live in a culture that is very fond of going to see someone else to analyze us. Unless you've got a serious disorder, garden variety uncertainty and lack of purpose does not need analysis by someone else. It needs analysis by yourself so that you can clearly recognize where you're underestimating yourself and short-changing yourself. Here are some questions for your self-analysis: * What experience have I had? How has this experience informed my growth? * What are my talents? List at least five. * What are my skills? Remember that talents are innate, skills need to be worked on to perfect them. * What are my strengths? Stop focusing on your weaknesses, you've probably done that long enough. Start looking at what your strengths are and start thinking about how you can make the most of them in the things you choose to do. * What do I want to be doing with my life? Am I doing it? If not, why not? * Am I happy with my health? If not, why not? And what can I do to move into wellness instead of living in sickness? * What makes me feel fulfilled? Am I working on that or am I busy working on other people's fulfillment? 5. Stop making your self-worth conditional on other people. Once you try to live up to an image of what you think others want to you to be, you lose self-worth. Instead, you are following a compass set by other people's expectations, whether or not those expectations are clearly defined or implied. Unfortunately, many people live this way, including making such choices as studies, career, where to live, and how many children to have, all based on expectations from parents, spouses, friends, and the media, and mostly because they are afraid of standing up for their own preferences and respecting their self-worth. * Be very wary of listening too much to people who regret the choices that they made in life and are willing to inflict their distress or anger at this regret upon others (especially upon the next generation). Such people won't enlighten you as to the path of acting on your self-worth but will try to either live out what they didn't get through you or even expect you to have the same rotten experiences they had by giving poor information, incorrect details, or simply omitting to inform you at all. People with healthy self-worth will share their insights and learning with you, and will be willing to guide you around life's many traps. Look for those people to mentor you rather than being misguided by the unhappy people. 6. Tell yourself that you matter. Realistic self pep-talks are great and affirming your self-worth openly to yourself can be a very good way to start changing the internal negative speak that you might have developed over time. Make set times during the day to remind yourself that you're a great person. Tell yourself you're special, wonderful, lovable, and loved. Affirmative talk is not the sole solution but it is part of a range of methods for boosting yourself and for taking out time to acknowledge that you do matter, as much as every person around you. 7. Prove to yourself that you matter. One of the problems with much advice on self-affirmations is that there is a sense that affirmations are in and of themselves magic. And that they are all that's needed to improve your sense of self. If only that were so, it'd be very easy to build self-worth! The reality is somewhat different and while it's important to use positive self-speak, it is also important to act on your sense of self-worth. And this is achieved by recognizing and accepting responsibility. Responsibility is about owning up to the fact that you are in control of your attitude, your reactions, and your sense of worth. As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, ""no one can make you feel inferior without your consent"", and that is the crux of poor self-worth - letting other people and circumstances serve as the source of lowering your self-worth is going to keep you stuck. Responsibility also requires that you relinquish the need to use blame as a source of coping; blame alleviates the need to look at yourself and to change your own behavior. While that seems like the easy option at times, it's also the one that will leave you stuck in time, and stuck with your negative feelings, and worst of all, leaves you feeling helpless. For blame implies that someone or something else has the power that you lack; and if that isn't giving up, then what is? * Learn to act together, with others, and not be acted upon. * Accept the responsibility for your circumstances. Make a decision to do something about them. Even if others appear to stand in your way, work around them. Don't resign. * Focus your energy on what you need to do to change the situation or the circumstances. Realize that other people have been wrapped up in the circumstances too and are not necessarily directing the outcome. * Don't blame your parents, the government, your next door neighbors. What have they got to do with the perfectly well-formed thinking matter inside your head? They may have made things difficult for you but you can understand that without using it as an excuse to reduce your self-worth. Avoid being a martyr; the responsibility to move on as a strong, whole person rests with you. * Work on your resilience. Resilient people have the emotional strength to get through life's difficulties without falling apart. This isn't about belittling the hardships and challenges of life – they are still very real – but it is about how you react and work your way through them. You always have a choice between demeaning yourself or always remembering your self-worth and staying firm in that resolve. 8. Heed opportunities. Opportunities present themselves in all sorts of ways. Grasping them is altogether another matter and not one many of us are adept at doing. Part of building self-worth is learning to recognize opportunities, however small, and working with them. Sometimes a great deal of patience will be called for; at other times, much self-restraint and downsizing of ambition might be needed. Whatever the case, take the opportunities life offers you and make the most of them because you deserve to do so. * Budget. Whatever else you do with your money, have a budget. Then you will actually know what else you're doing with your money. For some people, self-worth is overly dependent on their financial situation."	Retirement savings, investments, and savings in general are all things that will help ensure a sound life for you and financial freedom allows you the space to build self worth away from financial pressures.

Take your cat to the vet. When you first obtain your British shorthair cat, check its health and medical records. Reputable breeders should have gotten your cat its vaccinations and worm medications, but it is important to also get your cat neutered or spayed as soon as possible. Take it to the vet so that you can determine when your cat can be spayed or neutered, and set up a schedule with the vet so that your cat sees the vet at least twice annually for checkups. 2. Brush your cat’s teeth. British shorthair cats are at special risk for gingivitis, so brush your cat’s teeth daily using a specially formulated feline toothpaste. To get your cat acclimated to getting to its teeth brushed, let it lick something tasty off the brush – a snack or some chicken broth, for instance. Once you’ve familiarized your cat with the feel of the brush, have it sit somewhere comfortable. Add toothpaste to the brush, then part your cat’s lips and scrub gently in an up-and-down motion. * Talk to your cat throughout the process to help it stay at ease. * You may wish to use a finger brush – a small plastic gadget that fits snugly over your fingertip and has with very short bristles appropriate for a cat’s teeth. * Like human toothpastes, cat toothpastes are available in a variety of flavors like malt, tuna, and so on. Find a flavor that your cat enjoys to make the process more pleasant. 3. Look for signs of skin problems. If you see your cat excessively licking, chewing, or biting its skin, something might be wrong. Check the cat’s skin for redness, wounds, and irritation. These symptoms and behaviors could be caused by any number of conditions, including fleas, infections, or allergies. Consult your vet for more information and provide them with as much information as possible regarding when your cat’s skin problems first developed and what sort of behaviors the cat is engaged in. * If your cat’s chewing or scratching goes on for long enough, you might also notice bald patches where the skin is irritated. 4. Change your cat’s litter box regularly. British shorthair cats need their litterbox emptied of feces daily. The litter should be removed and replaced at least once every week, and in some cases as often as two days. Check the litter box often for clumping litter, foul smells, and wetness.

First, find out if you have arched feet or flat feet. If there is a curve in your foot, you have an arch. When you walk, you can see the arch and how high it is. If you have flat feet, you can tell because all of your foot is on the floor. 2\. For arched feet: Buy a shoe with a curve in the bottom of it. Some shoes have a choice of high to low arch support. You must wear supportive shoes at all times!! You can go barefoot, but not that much outside. 3\. For flat feet: Try buying shoes with a lower kind of arch so you can keep building it up and going higher in the arch support. It is not a bad thing if you were born with arched feet. It may come with the great big pack of family genes.	Sloppy width in your shoes can make your feet roll around in the shoe like beans in a maraca!

Contact: If you were to hit the ball with your toe it would fly straight along the red line.	The ball will roll back along the inside of your foot. You should be hitting the ball in the bottom corner. This means that you look at a ball straight on as if it were a circle and imagine a cross (+) across it.

Decide on a place to keep your flytrap: find a place flies are frequently found. Flytraps do not necessarily need to eat insects, but it's recommended since the insects provide nutrients to the plant. One or two insects a month are enough for an average size flytrap. Flytraps enjoy full sunlight, so if possible choose a place which gets about six hours of direct sunlight a day, like a windowsill, a greenhouse or even outside. 3. Pick a container! Native to the bogs and swamplands of North and South Carolina, Venus flytraps enjoy moist environments.	This can be as simple as a large glass goldfish bowl, a deep plastic pot and the top half of a clear soda bottle without the cap, or more than that if you want it fancier.

For instance, the exit code for the United States is 011, for Nigeria it’s 009, and for Saudi Arabia it’s 00. * You can find the exit codes by contacting your phone company or doing a quick internet search. Just type in the name of your country followed by “dial out code” or “exit calling code.” 2. Dial 86 to connect with China. This is the country code for China. The country code is typically 1-3 digits long and identifies the country to which you are placing a call. 3. Determine whether the phone number is for a landline or mobile phone. In China, mobile phone numbers are 11 digits (not including the exit or country codes), and they always begin with 1, whereas landlines are usually 6-8 digits (without the exit or country codes). * It is important to know whether the number is a landline or not, as you do not use area codes for Chinese mobile phones. 4. Dial the mobile number to call a mobile phone.	011 is the exit code, 86 the country code, and 155 5555 5555, is the mobile number.

Also, you'll need at least five full days free to film the show. 3. Have a family that's agreed to be filmed. A big part of the drama of the show is the dynamic between families, so it's necessary that you have a family living in the same household. Share the idea with the other people in the house as your spouse or children, and talk to them about how they would feel about being on the show. If someone in your house doesn't want to be on the show, you may have to reconsider. * You can say something like ""We've been complaining about our house for a while, and I was thinking we could submit an application for Love It or List It.

Bring your Syrian hamster home. Slowly get to know how your hamster likes to be handled. Before the taming process, it is a good idea to leave them alone for one or two days. You should never start by picking your hamster up! Try holding our treats for them. If they are too shy to take if from your hands, don't chase them, just put the treat down and wait for them to take it. Do this several times a day until your pet is comfortable with you. Then try putting the treat in your hand. After they will climb happily into your hand, try petting them gently as they eat. The last step is gently cupping them in your hands. This may take a long time with aggressive females, but tame, friendly males will allow you to hold them after just a few days. The ideal time to wait before picking up your hamster and taking it out of the cage to play is two to three weeks. To hold your hamster, slide one hand under it and cup the other round the front of its body. Ensure you are gentle. 2. Keep the cage clean. Syrian hamster cages should be cleaned out every other week or so and ""spot cleaned"" (removing fresh foods, cleaning toilet areas etc) each day, depending on the size and type of cage. Make sure its cage has been correctly disinfected and bedding has been changed before putting your hamster back in. While you clean the cage, you can put your pet in a hamster ball and have someone supervise it - but the hamster ball must be the right size -- most balls are only 6"" wide, so most are too small for Syrian hamsters. Get a larger 10"" ball at a minimum."	Cleaning the cage too often can cause stress; this does not mean do not clean your cage, rather, just clean it every other week and remember spot cleaning is your best friend.

Move slowly. If vertigo hits, the worst thing you can do is to change your position quickly. Reduce your feelings of dizziness by moving very slowly - we’re talking sloth’s pace. These slow movements will allow you to focus more easily and clear your head a bit better. If you need to, take short breaks between slow movements. 2. Avoid looking up or down. As with regular non-vertigo produced dizziness, looking up or down can cause further disorientation and feelings of unpleasantness. Avoid performing any activities that require you to look up or down for a long period of time or quickly. Keep your head level and parallel to the ground whenever possible. 3. Focus on a distant object. As a result of human perception, things close up seem to move faster whereas things far away move as if through molasses.	If necessary, look out a window to do so.

Obtain some party balloons. Something inexpensive, colorful, and heavy is easiest, but oblong or theme-shaped balloons may also be a nice touch, depending on what you're blowing up the balloons for.center * A bag of latex balloons can be found in supermarket chains or party shops. 2. Loosen the balloon by stretching it in all directions. If you stretch out the rubbery latex of the balloon with your hands first, you'll notice that it becomes much easier to blow up the balloons by mouth afterwards. Stretching the balloon will loosen the latex, making the inflation process less resistant. * Stretch the balloon in all directions, being careful not to tear the latex. Just make sure not to stretch the balloon too much, or you risk it popping when you inflate it. A few stretches here and there will get the job done just fine. 3. Pinch the neck of the balloon with your index finger and thumb just bellow the lip of the neck. This will keep the balloon in position when inflating. Grasp the end of the balloon about a quarter of an inch below the lip of the opening. Your index finger should be on top and your thumb on bottom. 4. Take a deep breath.	.

Choose to harbour positive emotions. Stated more simply: make the active decision to nurture a positive mindset. This is one of the quickest ways to affect your mood and outlook, both of which externalise themselves without your thinking about it and are constantly shaping how other people feel around you. Further, maintaining positive emotions will contribute to your own satisfaction and the amount of happiness you experience, which are also readily conveyed to others without your putting any effort into doing so. * Choose to hold onto positive thoughts* as they arise, and repeat them in your mind. Similarly, make the decision to set negative thoughts aside, and address any recurring sources of negativity. * *Think of harbouring positive emotions as providing the base of an “upwards spiral” that will contribute to your own emotional health and the enjoyment others derive in your company. * The more optimism you convey externally, the more positive experiences you’ll share. In turn, these will lead to greater personal and social comfort, success, and happiness. * *Perform acts of kindness whenever possible.* Acts of kindness will immediately send a pleasant, positive message to whomever witnesses or benefits from them. Take every opportunity to be kind, that comes your way – this will help you become more assertive and will inspire others to do so as well. Perhaps most importantly, acts of kindness will contribute to your feelings of happiness, a pleasant and empowering emotion that has an incredible tendency to spread like wildfire. * *Know that an act of kindness can be powerful, even when simple.* For instance, smiling while holding the door has the legitimate potential to improve someone’s day; don’t miss your next chance to do so. 2. Point out the little things. You don't have to constantly think or say that everything is great, beautiful, or amazing. In fact, you shouldn’t – no one will take you seriously. That said, you should take note of the little things that make you happy, and mention them to others when you believe they will share the enjoyment with you. Simply spreading a sense of general contentment in the spaces you share with others will make them appreciate your presence. * The degree to which “the simple things” really do matter cannot be understated. For instance, simply mentioning how refreshing the air is on a particular day, or pointing out the blue jay on the tree outside the office window will literally contribute pleasantly to the environments in which you interact with others. 3. Be more willing to bite your tongue. More specifically, reduce the frequency with which you criticize or make contentious statements. More bluntly, practice a bit of tact. Bite your tongue when a critical thought comes to mind that wouldn’t serve a constructive purpose if said aloud. *	.

Think of it like a Sunday afternoon visit to Grandma, even if you don't feel like it, you probably should go. So first up, make sure you go. It's a good opportunity to meet your superiors in a casual environment and a chance for networking with new people. Both are great things for career escalation. 2. Decide what to wear. Find out what everyone else is wearing before the party and match the tone with your outfit: * If it's casual dress and you turn up smart, that'll immediately put you on the back foot and make the rest of the evening very uncomfortable and also opens you up as an easy target for derision. The same applies the other way round. * If you are a woman, find a compromise between 'I'm attractive and sexy' and 'Take me seriously, I'm a professional'. Revealing clothing, while fun, is not appropriate around your superiors. 3. Arrive on time. This is an office party, not a discotheque. So turning up 'fashionably late' is not an option.	.

Limit exposure to risky investments - Be cautious about investing in emerging markets, ""junk"" bonds, technology stocks and commodities such as oil and gold. Before adding these volatile investments to your portfolio, do your homework and read every investment book you can lay your hands on and consult a financial adviser if necessary. 9.

Learn the different ways to purchase gold stocks. Generally speaking, one can invest in gold stocks in three different ways. Firstly, one can buy gold mining companies directly. Secondly, one can buy gold exchange trade traded funds, and thirdly, one can buy gold mutual funds. * There are pros and cons to each of these methodologies for investing in gold. The first step to purchasing gold stocks is being able to understand each of these ways to invest in gold stocks. In general, buying mining companies allows for direct albeit high risk exposure to gold mining, whereas mutual funds and ETF's offer lower risk and better diversification. 2. Analyzing individual gold miners. The first and most direct way to invest in gold stocks are to buy gold mining companies directly. This represents both the highest risk, and highest reward method of the three previously mentioned. Investing in individual gold stocks means making a bet on one particular company, as opposed to a large segment of companies or the industry as a whole. This means that analysis of the stock is essential to ensure you are picking stock that can be expected to perform better then its peers. * When selecting a gold mining stock, it is important to look for a few things. Firstly, look at cash costs per ounce. Gold producers have little purchasing power, so being able to produce gold at a low cost is an essential advantage. This information can be located on the website of the mining company, by clicking ""Investor Relations"", and then looking at the annual or quarterly earnings report. * Next, look to production. A strong gold miner should be able to grow its production annually. Strong production means both higher revenues, and lower costs. Once again, look to a company's annual reports for a few years to see if there is a trend of growing production. Often, companies will conveniently include this information in a chart. * Look at the company's debt compared to its peers. The best way to look at debt is using the debt/equity ratio, which compares what a company owes, to what a company owns essentially. This information can be found on websites like Morningstar.com, and the lower the number the better. *"	That is to say, how expensive are a dollar of one miners earnings compared to another? For this, using the price-to-earnings ratio, which divides share price by earnings. This information can also be found on websites like Morningstar.com, and once again, the lower the better.

Purchase a pool noodle or another piece of foam. Pool noodles are perfect because of their round shape and durability. They fit well over the back ends of clipboards while still providing plenty of room for pens. If you use a different piece of foam, pay attention to its size. Make sure it is wider than the clipboard. * Pool noodles are available at many general stores and pool supply stores. If you can’t find a pool noodle, look for foam blocks at general stores and craft supply stores, or shop online. 2. Cut the foam about wider than the clipboard. Place the pool noodle on the edge of the clipboard behind the clip. Make sure it goes at least past the clipboard on both ends. Measure it as needed with a ruler, then use a sharp pair of scissors or a craft knife to cut off the excess material. * The pen holder can be longer if you want it to be, but keep in mind that the extra length makes it more difficult to use and store. If you’re going to keep it out on your desk, for example, the extra length might not matter besides giving you room to store more pens. 3. Slice the foam lengthwise to fit it onto the clipboard. Make the cut from one end of the pool noodle to the other. Cut down the center in a single, straight line. Deepen the cut as needed to finish it, pulling the foam apart with your fingers before using the craft knife a second time. Make the cut deep enough to reach the middle of the foam. * Work slowly. Craft knives are sharp, and you may end up damaging the foam or your fingers if you aren’t careful. 4. Place the foam onto the edge of your clipboard. Push the clipboard into the cut you made. Make sure your pen holder fits tightly by cutting away excess foam or deepening the lengthwise cut as needed. Ideally, the foam doesn't get in the way of the clip, but covering it is okay. * You can put the foam over the clip. The clip will fit inside the cut you made without harming your pen holder. If the pen holder is too wide, you may need to remove it in order to use the clip, though. 5. Mark and cut holes in the foam for your pens. Make the first hole in the center of the pen holder. Use your craft knife to mark a spot as wide as the pen you plan on storing.	Cut multiple holes as needed if you plan on storing additional pens, spacing the holes about apart.

Don´t treat Brazilian women as loose, or you may be arrested for sexual harassment. The majority of Brazilians are Catholic, and they tend to be conservative regarding their sexual and moral values, although they may use few clothes because of the hot weather and also because many Brazilians live close to the beach. 2. Racism is a crime in Brazil, so it´s recommended to respect the Brazilian-African and indigenous heritage. Don´t associate Brazilians to bananas or monkeys and the like, because it´s considered deeply offensive. 3. In Brazil, it´s forbidden to take animals, plants and precious stones without permission of the government, and without paying taxes. 4. Drug traffic is a crime in Brazil and can be severely punished. 5. Brazilians don't like when foreigners talk in Spanish with them, because they don´t understand this language. Moreover, they may feel offended to see their culture associated with Mexican and Cuban values––such as sobreros, salsa, guerrillas and revolutionary socialism. 6. Brazilians don´t like when foreigners associate Rio de Janeiro as the capital of Brazil. (Rio hasn't been the capital of Brazil since the '60s.) 7. Brazilians don´t like when foreigners associate their country with favelas (slums). Brazil has one of the world's largest economies and more than five thousand cities, so thinking that Brazil is a favela is a demonstration of bias and ignorance. In fact, just 6% of the brazilian population lives inside favelas and similar ""comunidades"". Therefore this means that 94% of the brazilian population enjoy conventional housing conditions. 8. Brazilians appreciate when foreigners know the language, capital, and size of the brazilian economy and territory. They´ll also like when it´s demonstrated some knowledge about soccer, BJJ and Capoeira, their favorite sports. They will also appreciate if you know something about the Brazilian states, such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Bahia, Ceará, Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná. 9.

They just stop wherever they are, and if you try to pass among every one, people may think you're being rude. 10. Be careful about keeping your appointments. In Brazil, especially in São Paulo, you must always worry about traffic. If it is raining or if an accident happens, it can be a big problem. So, just as a precaution, leave your place one hour before you were thinking and, maybe, you will be on time for your appointment. 11. Forget all the naked women with painted bodies that you see on carnival; that's not Brazil's everyday reality. In fact even being topless is forbidden on most beaches. A lot of Brazilian women wear very tiny bikinis, however. On a hot summer day, men generally wear T-shirts and shorts, and women wear short skirts and tank tops. Nudity is usually forbidden, except in a few nude beaches. Men walking in the street without a shirt is not typical. 12. Behaviour rules also include not urinating in open air and not drinking alcohol on the street (you can go to jail for driving with alcohol in your blood, even in small quantities). Most kinds of drugs are also forbidden, even the lighter ones; and one can go to jail for drug use or possession. By the way, prisons here are not very nice. 13. ""Yes"" does not always mean ""yes"". Brazilians are very informal in social life and also in business. But when the time to get to an agreement comes, be aware that ""yes"" does not always mean ""yes"". Brazilians don't like to openly say ""no"", so a ""yes"" usually turns into a ""maybe""."	.

Buy_Rhubarb.txt	Begin_Revision	0.895	### Getting Rhubarb for Cooking	60	However , if the leaves are still attached , they can also help you pick out the best rhubarb .	### Getting Rhubarb for Cooking	102	If the leaves are still attached , they can also help you pick out the best rhubarb .	<delete><However><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><if><3><If><1>	True	Getting Rhubarb for Cooking  1. Recognize the different rhubarb crops. Rhubarb generally grows in two crops. The first, or forced, crop grows in pots and is harvested between January and early February. This rhubarb is more tender and delicately flavored. The second, or maincrop, crop arrives between late March and early June. It has a more intense flavor and robust texture than the early crop. Knowing the seasons and crops in which rhubarb grows can help you buy the most optimal one for your purposes. In some places, there is a third crop from late July to early August. 2. Find plump stalks. Look for rhubarb at your local farmer’s market or grocery store. Sort through the plants and look for stalks that are plump. These are often the best stalks of rhubarb for consumption. * Some plump stalks may be green, which can indicate that they are older. These may be less flavorful. 3. Feel the stalk for texture. Good quality rhubarb stalks are firm to the touch. They should also be crisp, which you can test by snapping off a small bit. Getting firm, crisp stalks of rhubarb can help you turn them into a wonderful dish. * Keep in mind first crop rhubarb stalks may be more tender in texture than second crop ones. 4. Examine at the stalk color. Rhubarb can range in color from green to a deep red. Opt for redder stalks of rhubarb. These are younger, more tender, and sweeter stalks that may taste better. Some stalks may have a slight green-ish tinge to them, which is normal. Buy these if there aren’t any perfectly, deep red stalks available. 5. Look at the stalk’s luster. One final trait that can signal the quality of a rhubarb stalk is the luster. Check for shinier plants, which can indicate that they are young, fresh and delicious. 6. Check the leaves. Many stores and markets will remove rhubarb leaves because you can’t eat them. They are poisonous when consumed in large quantities.	Find leaves that are a brighter green color. They should also be perky and not wilted. This can help tell if you the stalks are older or haven’t received proper care.

Everyone deserves to look and feel beautiful! The following steps can be incorporated into your morning routine and take fewer than 5 minutes!   1. Firstly, start with a clean face - hopefully you have removed all of yesterday's makeup last night to give your face a well-deserved break! If not, gently cleanse with a soap-free cleanser. 2. Next, pat your face with moisturizer. Do this first thing in the morning so it will have time to really absorb. To get really even coverage, use one with the same type of basic ingredients as your foundation - water- or oil- based. 3. After moisturizer is no longer ""damp"" to the touch, we'll begin applying foundation.  * Use a foundation or tinted moisturizer that matches your skin shade (some people prefer one that's a little lighter or warmer than their natural skin tone for evening out or giving a healthy glow respectively. Play a little and figure out what you like! Also don't be afraid to mix. Remember when buying that the harsh flourescent lights of a drugstore can make colors look funny.) * First, begin by patting foundation in spots where you feel you need more coverage, under eye circles, sides of nose, etc. There is no need for a separate ""concealer!"" They are usually too heavy and cakey. * Secondly, blend foundation evenly all over your face, covering ""concealed areas"" again lightly as part of overall base. * Be sure to blend gently down past jawbones and chin onto neck so you do not create a makeup ""mask.""   1."	Don't use much, and lightly press on and dust off the excess. This prevents you from rubbing off your beautifully applied base.

Curling/straightening hair is alright if you have too..but your beautiful without any of that! Makeup is ok, but NO eyeliner..just a pinch of eyeshadow and a swipe of mascara and you will look really nice..or go natural! 2. -Clothes- PLAIN, PLAIN, PLAIN! wear shirts with nothing on them is the best way to keep that innocent childhood look. Pinks, Purples, greens, light blues etc...stay away from a lot of black. Stripes are cool.	Hoodies are great but don't use them too much. Aeropostale, abercrombie, american eagle etc..are accepted but DON'T wear them all the time! Vests are adorable.. Also buy a cute wool coat like the ones at Old Navy. The point of this style is not everything being expensive, but being classy and looking good. If you have cleavage, don't make it look too obvious..no low cut shirts. Get a good pair of pajamas.. especially with childish prints on them.

Use only green cleaners. In the process of cleaning your home, you may actually make the problem worse. Choose only cleaners without bleach and quats (quaternary ammonium compounds), which are known for triggering allergic reactions. Or, make your own home cleaning solution by mixing together 50% water and 50% vinegar in a spray bottle. * Some groups, such as the Environmental Working Group (EWG), evaluate and list green cleaning products on their websites. 2. Stick to a weekly cleaning routine. On the same day each week, go through and mop/vacuum your floors. Use a dusting wand or microfiber cloth to wipe down other surfaces. Don’t forget to look up top, too. Ceiling fans, crown molding, and the tops of bookshelves are all places where allergens can gather. * If possible, allergy sufferers should leave household cleaning to someone else. If the person with allergies must clean, wear a disposable dust mask, especially while vacuuming. 3. Get a HEPA vacuum. These types of vacuums are designed to remove and trap small particles, even down to 0.3 microns in size.	Be aware that some vacuums are marketed as “allergen removers,” without being HEPA.

Toss any plug-ins. Those cute little plug-in air fresheners or candles may be sending out volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into your home’s air. These VOCs can then cause or make worse any respiratory problems. They can also trigger headaches and migraines. 2. Open the windows. Go into each room and crack at least one window on a weekly basis. Pollen counts peak between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., so it’s best to open everything up in the early morning or evening. Even keeping your windows open for ten minutes can refresh the air in your home. * Installing screens on your windows and keeping your air conditioning running will help to limit the outdoor allergens (and pests) that will enter your home. 3. Take care of your indoor plants. Household plants, such as English Ivy, can actually absorb toxins in the air and help to keep your home allergen free. However, they can also release mold into the air if they are overwatered or not trimmed back. Select plants that you are comfortable caring for and you’ll see cleaner air as a result. 4. Install true exhaust fans. The fans in your kitchen and bathroom should send the air they suck in directly outside. Otherwise, you may be shooting dangerous moisture and particles into your attic or right back into your home.	.

Set a theme: It could preferably be done before the the party (while sending invites). Alternatively, make an impromptu suggestion on a telltale crazy theme. This could work out as a pleasant surprise, bringing out latent or hesitant enthusiasm. People could also come up and suggest successful themes that have worked; ultimately everyone is on their toes discussing crazy ideas for the party. 2. Befriend like-minded people: There will surely be more people who'd want a more happening party. Befriend these guys and start infecting the party scene with your jokes, anecdotes and laughter. Experience the drab scene immediately change into one oozing with fervor. 3. Pull out the kids: Kids are major entertainers and their zeal is pretty contagious. Once a group of excited kids start something zany, their parents would notice and start watching. That would eventually attract more viewers. For all we know, this might turn into an all-age group activity or game that could considerably brighten the whole scene up. 4. Host a ""Crack a Joke"" contest: Not many can resist a good laugh, joke, anecdote or pun if it is within their taste. A contest, to come out with the best wise-cracks could do wonders to a dull scene. If not all, some people with a good sense of humor & good joke-memory and story telling skills could infect the crowd with their funny banter. 5. Change the music: A party without music is unheard of. But a party without the right kind of music is common. Judge the populace attending the party & change the music accordingly. A young crowd could be perked up with some loud hard rock, a little older people would prefer melodious romance; a middle-aged gathering could go for soft-soothing numbers whereas an even older crowd wouldn't mind instrumentals lulling the background. A mixed crowd could have a DJ judging the mood and playing music as per the taste. Or better still, get a music-loving friend to act as DJ to play song requests & dedications for all the guests. 6. Shake a leg: Again, parties where one doesn't jig a bit, barely exist. But yes, there could be some gatherings where people might need that little push to hit the floor and set the scene on fire. With the right kind of music and atmosphere a party can come to life with everyone up & about, trying to demonstrate a step or two. Or simply letting it go... 7. Go innovative with games: Games are the life to any party."	Go for unconventional methods of playing conventional games. Add new components & fun factors to pull out the woeful guests from their no-activity mode. Pose a challenge, keep interesting rewards & make the losers come out with fresh ideas for winning. Avoid gambling or cash games, as that deviate the party towards a totally different direction altogether.

(Monster Reincarnation, Mystical Space Typhoon, etc.) Keep in mind that you want as close as you can to a 40 card deck, so you will have more of a chance in drawing the Egyptian Gods. 3. I also like adding the field spell card Zombie World, the continuous trap card Shiranui Style Samsara, and the continuous spell card Everliving Underworld Cannon. These cards go really well together.	Also make sure you don't plan on tribute summoning after this point.

Turn off your email, phone, and social media. When you are working, go through and silence and turn off as many of your electronic devices as you can. You might even go so far as to put a “do not disturb” sign on your door. This minimizes the temptation to take small social media or email breaks, which eventually add up to huge time wastes. * It’s a good idea to let your family and friends know that you are really swamped at work. Tell them that you will not be taking personal calls during business hours until you get caught up. * If you must check your email or voicemail for work, set specific times to do so. For example, fifteen minutes into every hour you will spend a maximum of five minutes looking at your emails and messages. 2. Set a “no interruptions” timer. If it is not feasible to shut off your email or phone long term, guarantee a chunk of work time by pushing a “no interruptions” rule. Get a kitchen timer and set it to 30 minutes (or the maximum time that you are comfortable with) and then work at a fast pace until the time runs out. When the timer dings, that is the signal to your coworkers that you are available again for conversation. * If you are in a loud or very busy environment, you could try putting on headphones and listening to some non-distracting music or no music at all. 3. Take short, purposeful, breaks. Keep an eye on your breaks and limit them to 10 minute intervals, aside from lunch. Set a timer on your phone to keep you on track.	Take a quick walk outside. Close your eyes and just relax. Read a few pages of your favorite book. Do a few fast runs up and down the office stairs.

Purchase a coffee maker. Although stopping by a coffee shop each morning may be part of your routine, if your favorite coffee is affecting your waistline (or wallet), consider making your own drinks at home. * To start making healthier versions at home, you'll need to purchase a coffee maker. You can either purchase a traditional multi-cup coffee maker or an espresso machine. Most coffee shop drinks are made with espresso, so you might choose this instead. * You may want to purchase a machine that allows you to make a single shot of espresso. These generally require you to buy individual pods of espresso so you can make one individual shot. * You can also go with a more traditional espresso machine where you buy the coffee drinks, pack it into the machine and brew your espresso. These are a little more time intensive, but give you great espresso. 2. Brew your coffee. The main ingredient in coffee house drinks is the coffee. You'll need to start by brewing up coffee or espresso to make your own homemade coffee house drink. * Espresso machines, even the small individual brewers, can get expensive. However, you can brew regular coffee, but make it really strong for a similar flavor to espresso. * For cappuccinos, you need to make at least 1/3 of your total drink volume coffee. Fill up your coffee mug or travel cup about 1/3 of the way up. The same goes for lattes and the other popular coffee house drinks. * If you make a large quantity of espresso or strong coffee, consider keeping it the refrigerator so you can have it ready to go for the next day. 3. Measure out your milk. The next most important ingredient in your coffee house drink is the milk. Depending on what type of drink you're making, the amount and temperature of the milk will vary. * For hot coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos, you'll need to heat your milk. Lattes are made with 1/3 coffee and 2/3 milk. Heating your milk over the stove or in the microwave will work. *	The only way to get foam is by using a milk frother or putting your warmed milk in a blender. Pour in the milk followed by your desired amount of foam.

The ASPCA also offers a free online search tool to help find adoptable pets. Other useful websites include Petfinder, WorldAnimal, and AdoptAPet. * These websites will include animals offered by independent adoption agencies. Visit particular agencies websites and look for information like a board of directors with names and contact information and regular adoption events. * Read third-party reviews of the agencies you’re interested in as well, on sites like Google or Yelp. Further, feel free to call a vet in the agencies area to see if they are familiar with the organization and have any advice about working with them. 2. Visit or contact any organization you may want to work with. If there is an adoption facility that you’re interested in in your area, visit them.

Prepare the thermometer by lubricating the tip with petroleum jelly. Lubricating the thermometer will make the experience slightly less intrusive for your dog.center 4. Have another individual restrain the dog's upper body. It helps if the person is already familiar with the animal.center * Rather than hold the dog down by applying downward force--which is very uncomfortable and can cause the animal to become more nervous or anxious--try embracing the animal tightly around its neck and upper body, allowing its head to rest on your shoulders. 5. Lift the dog's tail to expose the rectum. Lifting from the base of the tail, rather than the tip, will give you more control over the animals movement and prevent the dog's tail from wagging.center * It may be helpful to have your partner hold the dog's tail up for you. 6.

Review your state's law. Different states have different definitions of the intrusion of solitude claim and what you must prove. * While almost every state recognizes some right of privacy, each state's law enables different types of claims that require proof of different elements. * The Digital Media Law Project has summaries of intrusion laws in several key states available at http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/elements-intrusion-claim. * Generally, intrusion of solitude claims have four elements. First, you must prove that the defendant, or person you're suing, intentionally intruded into your private affairs without your consent. * In most states, courts require a physical intrusion – such as by physically entering your property or using technology such as zoom lenses or microphones to snoop on your private conversations or activities. * The second element requires the intrusive activities of the defendant to be something a reasonable person would find offensive. This goes beyond something that would merely be embarrassing or uncomfortable. * For example, if someone barged in on you while you were using the restroom, that might be embarrassing but it typically wouldn't be considered offensive. However, if the person not only barged in on you but also took a photo of you on the toilet, that typically would be considered offensive. * The third element requires that the defendant's intrusion be into a place or situation in which you have a reasonable expectation of privacy. A restroom is a classic example of a place where you expect privacy, but bedrooms also may qualify in certain instances. *	It's not enough that you were embarrassed but quickly got over it and moved on with your life – the intrusion must have relatively long-lasting psychological effects.

This is a shame because it usually leads to that student quitting out of dissapointment and never getting the opportunity to experience all the great benefits of Martial Arts training. Write down your goals beforehand and be specific even if you're not sure which style you wish to practice. 2. Shop around. Don't join the first school you go to unless you are positive that no other could meet your needs any better. Nearly all Martial Arts schools offer a free trial period or at least a free class. Narrow the search down to the schools that you enjoyed the most and from which you benefited. If you're not having fun than chances are that you will not last at that particular academy. 3. Find a qualified instructor. Research his/her credentials and make sure that you feel comfortable with this person. Remember also, ""world champion"" does not always equal ""great teacher"". The teacher that takes his time with you and helps you to understand the lesson will be much more helpful than the undefeated grand champion of the world who just boasts about how great he is. Even if you have to drive a little further or pay a little more for training it will be well worth it to know that you are getting great instruction. 4."	Also, don't forget to ask plenty of questions. While discipline is a large part of martial arts you must remember that the instructor is working for you and you deserve the best instruction available. Good luck and good training. travistookedotcom

Don't panic. While it is natural to try and take away the symptoms and to stop the poor child feeling so miserable, realize that all of the symptoms are natural and understandable reactions, mostly brought on by ignorance to the condition and general brainwashing! In actual fact, in bringing the fever down you are only aiding and abetting the enemy! 2. Rely on the heat responses. When the initial responses of the immune system are not sufficient in dealing with all the invading pathogens, or if it has been thwarted in its natural efforts to heal, your body launches another attack – turn up the heat! The most commonly known method of sterilising anything, from your baby’s bottle to high tech medical equipment is with an increase in heat. You can boil bottles and teats in a pot of boiling water for ½ hour or put medical equipment in an autoclave, which intensifies the heat, thus killing off all possible bacteria and/or viruses. This is exactly what your body is doing when spiking a fever – turning up the heat to kill the bacteria and viruses. So when you know what to do, the best thing for you to do is – nothing! * The role of a fever is to literally kill the bacteria and viruses that are causing the system distress. Bacterial and viral proteins die off at different temperatures, bacteria at below 40°C (usually 38 – 39.5) and viruses at over 40°C, usually 40-41ºC. If a child's fever gets above 40C please seek medical attention immediately. Fever can cause coma and brain damage. 3. Allow the fever to do the work. If you leave the fever alone, do not give anything to bring it down, then the immune system can kill all pathogens leaving your child’s body free and healed. When the fever breaks on its own and the temperature starts coming down, your child will wake up better. The previous is trye but only in relation to relatively low fevers, if a childs fever breaks 40C please seek medical attention immediately. * The presence of bacterial and viral proteins is detected by the immune system and cause the “set point” of the thermostat in our brains to rise. These substances are known as pyrogens. The body then responds with raising the overall temperature, by conserving heat and stimulating more heat production. It generally takes a few hours after the thermostat has been reset before the temperature actually rises, which means that the pathogens and pyrogens have been present and invading for hours already – even more reason to allow the fever to do its work. * Chills are often felt before the heat, because this is one of the mechanisms of heat production. When the thermostat level is set higher than normal, the relative current temperature is now colder than the setting, hence the child feels cold, relatively speaking. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, get smaller and deeper, to prevent heat loss from the skin causing a cold feeling. Shivering follows because the brain instructs the skeletal muscles to contract in order to create movement & friction that heats the body up. The hair follicles on the skin also perk up, trapping a layer of air underneath which insulates the skin and increases the temperature – this is commonly known as “goose flesh”! * As the temperature increases to the new level set by the thermostat, these chilly symptoms abate, because the temperature now reflects the setting and the child feels neither hot nor cold – despite an elevated temperate reading. * At this point the temperature may stabilise for a few hours, alerting you to the fact that this is the optimal temperature for the destruction of the enemy. If the child is calm but just hot, leave them be, this is not dangerous and is vital in killing off the baddies! 4. Use homeopathic remedies. These work wonderfully in supporting the body’s fever attempts and allow rapid healing through this manner. Commonly known remedies that have been known to assist in as little as a few minutes at times are Belladonna and Aconite. However, finding the remedy that is specific for that particular fever may take a little more thought. These two remedies will not necessarily cure all fevers; homoeopathic remedies are very specific to the nature of the symptoms. Consult a registered practitioner for more specified care or get yourself some good over-the-counter remedies to keep in your medicine cabinet. The sooner homoeopathic remedies are given, the quicker the healing happens. * Homoeopathic remedies enhance the immune system’s ability to fight off the invasion, supporting the body in all its healing attempts. Homoeopathic remedies do not stop the symptoms at all, will not actively bring down the fever as a paracetamol or ibuprofen based chemical medicine would, but rather support and speed up the body’s healing abilities, thus bringing about rapid healing. When the body has won the battle, the fever will come down, usually within 1-3 days of homoeopathic intervention. After which health is restored and recurrences are infrequent. 5. Note the response to the increase in heat. When the immune system has won the battle and most of the pathogens have been killed off, an apparent crisis arises. The child will suddenly get very hot, feel very hot to touch and often begins sweating excessively. This is because the pyrogens have been removed to a safer level, the bacteria and viruses killed, and the thermostat has been reset to normal again. The body must now bring down the temperature of the internal environment. Blood vessels in the skin dilate; get wider and closer to the skin, causing heat to be radiated from the skin as well as the red / pink hue of a fever. Sudden sweating also follows, which is a well known way in which the body cools itself down. * This sudden change in events is called the crisis or the flush. It is at this point that one really panics and the child often wakes up crying and feels awful. This phase usually lasts a short time and is a clear sign that the temperature will soon be falling. The child then falls into a deep sleep and wakes a few hours later feeling fantastic and full of beans – just when you are collapsing from exhaustion and worry! * However, if you keep dropping the temperature with antipyrexial medicines (all the pain killer varieties), you are preventing the body from killing the bacteria or virus and allowing it a few more hours to invade the system further and create a more deep seated, complicated illness. When the drug has worn off, does the temperature not elevate again? This is because the body is now free from the restraints of the drug and is able to try and defend again; it is desperately trying to heal you, but is being disarmed, so to speak. The more you keep bringing down a fever, the more you help the baddies and disarm the body. 6. Know how to deal with convulsions. Although frightening when not understood, convulsions are actually not that dangerous and are seldom the cause of any brain damage as is commonly thought. Recent research would seem to indicate that fever convulsions have no lasting negative effects on a child and only about 2% of people (children & adults included) will ever get a fever convulsion. Convulsions are caused by excessive heating of the centre of the brain that is responsible for temperature control, which leads to abnormal activity in the brain area that controls muscle contractions, this results in a fever fit. * There does seem to be a family predisposition to them, though, and once your child has had one, he or she is more prone to further attacks. Care needs to be taken however, to ensure that your child does not suffer with epilepsy. If your child convulses at a low grade temperature, below 38.5°C, then professional help must be sort. * The fit may start suddenly and can be preceded by quite a scream. If the fever stays very high for a long time, certain measures can be taken to reduce the fever somewhat, so as to prevent a convulsion yet still maintain its fighting capacity. However, if a fit ensues, your child will get rigid and his arms and legs will begin jerking. His eyes may roll backwards or he may stare fixedly into space. Sometimes frothing at the mouth also occurs. He may become bluish in the face caused by a spasm of the diaphragm which can also cause a difficulty in breathing for a short time. * It’s usually all over in a minute after which your child may stay unconscious for a short while, then wake up, appearing dazed and confused and then fall off into a deep sleep for a while longer. Leave them to sleep, try not to wake them as this sleep is very necessary for the recovery of the brain and system in general. Just keep checking that they are resting peacefully, breathing easy and begin some external measures of lowering the temperature to prevent a further fit, like gently wiping down with a tepid to cool cloth, never a cold one. Contact your practitioner as soon as possible or take your child for a check up. 7. Handle a fit: as in all first aid practices, always check your ABC’s: AIRWAY, BREATHING, CIRCULATION. * Check the clock so that you can time the length of the fit. * Turn your child onto his side to prevent his tongue falling back and possibly blocking his airway (actually swallowing the tongue is impossible). * Wipe away any mucus, foam, food particles or anything else that may be blocking his mouth by sweeping one finger across his mouth (never use a 2-fingered pincer grasp as this can push the blockage further in). * Loosen all tight clothing to allow free movement. * DO NOT restrain your child at all, allow his body to shake as it needs to, the muscles are very rigid and if restrained, this may result in injury. * DO NOT try to give him anything in his mouth, especially no food, drink or dummies. *	Understand that they are following the exact commands of their bodies and will ask for and accept anything that they need.

This is only if you intend to buy your herbal conditioner: * Do your research: Find ingredients that you think will work best for your hair and then check the ingredient list to see how high it's content is in that particular product: The order of ingredients listed tells you how high it is in that product, first is the highest, second is the 2nd highest, etc. * Read online reviews and find others with your hair type that have used those products and see what their results are. You can check on sites like makeupalley.com or naturallycurlyhair.com. This gives you a good idea of whether its worth buying or not. * *You should be able to make an informed choice on your product by now, so happy shopping. 2. Okay, so know that we have given you a basic shopping guideline, here's for your handy folk who want to make your own products which in my opinion is a great option because at least you know what's going into it. * Let's start with the base of a homemade herbal conditioner and work our way from the ground up. A good formula for a base varies by hair type, which to ease the amount of wordage here, I will direct you to the best website for explanation:http://fromgrandmaskitchen.com/Natural-Hair-Beauty/articles/3881/6/What-Hair-Type-and-Texture-do-You-Have-Straight-Wavy-Curly-Kinky-or-Nappy/Page6.htmlhair. A good base for all hair types is an organic lotion with no sulfates or parabens, for example anything with coconut, or shea butter is moisturizing, aloe vera is soothing,peppermint, and eucalyptus,and rosemary are cleansing and stimuulating, and tea tree oil is anti-fungal and great for irritated scalps. I've heard good things about Alba Botanica and Burt's Bees. * Now that you have a set base, you can add a few oils, because despite common beliefs you can use oils on any type of hair; it won't make it oily as long as you know which ones to use.You can check out websites like http://www.mountainroseherbs.com/bulkherb/bulkherb.html, http://www.fromnaturewithlove.com/soap/product.asp?product_id=OILCAMELLIA, or http://www.newdirectionsaromatics.com/grapeseed-carrier-oil-p-454.html which gives great info on the basic carrier oils and essential oils that you can blend for your hair. The basic carrier oils are: jojoba, grapeseed, sweed almond, Coconut seed, kukui nut, etc. carrier oils are easier for storage because of their long term shelf life, and are derived from the fatty parts like the seeds. Essential oils come from the leaves, barks, roots, etc. * A few good basic oils for any hair are coconut, jojoba, sunflower seed, eucalyptus or peppermint, rosemary, and sage, avocado, and pomegranate oil. * The most important ingredients to look at would be the herbs, I would recommend using fresh plants because their the most potent and typically will have a long shelf life. I have heard that sage and rosemary are the most cleansing, arnica stimulates the scalp, peppermint, tea tree and eucalyptus stimulate and refresh an irritated scalp, horsetail strengthens the hair, and chinese fox glove root encourages hair growth, for more info you can check out http://www.holisticonline.com/remedies/hair/hair_loss_herbs.htm, http://www.allayurveda.com/herbs.asp and natural-products.suite101.com/.../hair_care_using_fresh_herbs . 3. Now that you have an idea of a few good basic ingredients, here's how you put together your very own organic conditioner: 4. As I previously stated, use the lotion as your base and layer the oils in the order of what you want a higher concentration of: the base is most prevalent because it's the first ingredient, the second is 2nd highest in concentration and so on. REMEMBER: Don't use more than three oils in your products, and I would really only use two.	So, good luck with your new herbal conditioner. Happy experimenting!

Talk to a trustworthy friend or family member. Sometimes just talking to someone about what you are dealing with can make you feel better. Try talking to a trustworthy friend or family member about what has been happening in your home life. * For example, you could try talking with a close friend about the way that your parents make you feel. Choose someone you feel comfortable talking to and who you know will not turn around and repeat what you said to your parents. * Try to avoid becoming too dependent on this person for your emotional needs. Just talk when you need someone to listen to you. If you find yourself calling several times a day for reassurance, then you may be developing a codependent relationship with this person. Talk to your school counselor or therapist if you find yourself depending more and more on other people for validation. 2. Find a mentor. Mentors can guide you through important life decisions and teach you things that your parents are not willing or able to teach you. You can find a mentor to help you learn new skills for navigating difficult situations, succeeding in school, or advancing your professional career. Try asking a trustworthy, responsible adult in your life to mentor you, such as a coach, a teacher, or a boss. * If your coach or boss offers to mentor you, make sure that you take him or her up on that offer. However, you can also try asking someone to mentor you, such as by saying, “I admire your success in life and I hope to achieve many of the same things you have someday.	Would you be willing to mentor me?”

Keep in mind that a mentor cannot replace your parents you should not look to this person for parental guidance. A mentor is just someone who can help you reach your goals in school, work, or in another specific area of your life. 3. Seek help from a therapist or school counselor. Learning to cope with your parents’ behavior can be difficult, so you may need to seek help from a therapist or school counselor. A therapist or your school counselor can help you to develop coping mechanisms and begin to feel better about yourself. * Try asking your parents if you can see a therapist by saying something like, “I have been struggling with some things lately, and I would like to see a therapist to talk about them. Can you help me find one?” * If your parents say no, then just ask a teacher to let you talk to the school counselor. Your school’s counselor can listen to what is going on and help you learn some ways to cope. * Keep in mind that if your parents are abusing you, then your therapist or school counselor will be required to report it. 4. Resist comparing how they treat you and your siblings. If your parents seem to favor a sibling over you, it doesn’t mean they love one of you any more or less. There could be a situational reason why they treat your sibling with more thoughtfulness or effort. Most of the time it is also unintentional, and your parents may not even realize they are treating you differently. * Most aren’t trying to make you feel unloved but aren’t being aware of how their actions affect kids mentally and emotionally . * Try not to focus on how your parents treat your siblings. Instead, just focus on how they treat you. 5. Try not to take it personally. It can be hard to dismiss criticism and hurtful language from people who are supposed to love you, even if you know that what they are saying isn’t true. Remember that your parents’ behavior and words is about them and not about you. * The next time one of your parents says something mean or does something to hurt you, try telling yourself, “I am a good person with value. My parents are just struggling with personal issues and that is why they said/did that.” 6. Be kind to yourself. Some children who are mistreated by their parents treat themselves badly as well, such as by cutting, using alcohol or drugs, or intentionally failing at school.	Instead of doing these things, make sure that you nurture yourself, such as by:

Invest in a good HD camera. This is very important. There are good HD cameras available for around $250. 2. Audio. This is more important than video. The typical viewer can stand a lousy video camera but if they can't hear you, they'll probably click off your video. You can buy an OK microphone for around 15-30 bucks. However, if you're looking for excellent audio on a budget, consider investing in a microphone in the $100-$200 range, i.e. the Rode VideoMic. 3. Lighting. This will improve your video quality by making your video less noisy. Make sure your room (or wherever your filming) is full of lights. For a tutorial on how to get good lighting, search on YouTube or Google. 4. Make videos that people want to watch. Try to make your content original and funny, as it will help you retain your audience. 5. Jump cuts help, but can draw the viewer away from the video if used too often. Most of the top YouTubers use them. However, if you are going for more of a professional look, try to avoid jump cuts. 6. Make your videos short. 1-3 minutes is good (especially when starting out). Remember that most people on YouTube get bored fast. If they don't like what they see in the first 5-10 seconds they'll leave the video, so draw them in fast. 7. Editing. As stated previously, using excess jump cuts can draw viewers away from your video.	Don't use too many, though, or viewers will click off your video. Make sure your editing is nice and smooth before posting on YouTube.

Ignore taunting. If you are being bullied by other teenagers, you should try to ignore their taunts. Instead of getting defensive, try to explain your illness. If you refuse to become upset, they may become bored and stop their taunting. * If you can joke about your condition, you may be able to deflect bullying. For example, if someone says that you walk like an old person, tell them “Well, duh. That’s because I’ve got old joints.” * If bullying is severe, note when and where it happened. Let both your teacher and your parents know. Schools are required to handle cases of bullying when the student is being harassed due to a medical condition. 2. Meet other teens like you. Try to go to conventions or ask your doctors about ways to meet other teens with arthritis. This will help prevent you feeling misunderstood. You may also find a local support group, such as your local chapter of the Arthritis Foundation. These groups will provide you venues to discuss your social and physical struggles of having juvenile arthritis. 3. Express your feelings. Don't bundle up pain and emotions inside. You should remember your arthritis is not your fault, and it is all right to feel angry, sad, or frustrated with your disease. There are many ways that you can express and manage your emotions in a healthy way. * Write in a journal * Vent to close friends * Talk to your school psychologist or a therapist 4. Avoid defining yourself by your illness. Don't let your arthritis control your life. Make sure people know you as more than just ""the kid with arthritis."" You can still be a girly-girl, rocker, punk, or jock. Arthritis is a medical condition, and you can still express your personality in whatever way that you want. *"	You might want to put inserts in them to help with arthritis in lower extremities. You should, however, avoid wearing heels.

Cold_Approach_a_Girl.txt	Begin_Revision	0.951	### After you approach	2177	For example if you have a vulgar or sexual sense of humor then express it , if she does n't like it there is a good chance that she is not going to be compatible with you in the long run .	### After you approach	2248	If you have a vulgar or sexual sense of humor then express it , if she does n't like it there is a good chance that she is not going to be compatible with you in the long run .	<delete><For><1>|||<delete><example><2>|||<replace><if><3><If><1>	True	After you approach  1. Start with a genuine compliment. After approaching say something like 'Hi, You are cute' or 'you are adorable’ or ‘you look pretty' or 'I like your style' or anything to complement her genuinely. Don't beat around the bush, be clear with your intentions right away. This can save you from getting into friend-zoned and pain in the long run. Along with that it’s also a great way to ease the conversation. 2. Be curious and talk to her in the same way you would talk to a new/old friend. It means the way you talk, your body language, your voice intensity etc, try to keep it as normal as possible. Think a little deeper...yes she is a stranger, but if she is a normal 'Human Being' then she does hang out with her friends, has hobbies, works, studies, has a life story, family, music, movies, has interests etc. These things are good enough to make you feel curious about her. In addition if you express your curiosity genuinely, not only it would make her feel special but also would help reduce your 'self-made' awkwardness of the situation. 3. Maintain eye contact. It not only conveys that you are a confident person but also helps you build attraction with the girl. Don't beam at her breast every now and then; it’s going to come out as creepy and reduces chances of a relationship with her. 4. Smile. It’s a very good way to express that you are a friendly person. It also helps defuse the tension of a cold approach. If she is smiling back in a normal way then that's a good sign. However if she is smiling back in an uncomfortable way or not smiling at all that's a cue for you to do something to make her feel comfortable like shaking her hand, becoming more polite, keeping a good distance from her, asking her something to divert her mind, saying something light and funny etc. Basically, things that would make her feel comfortable in the situation. * Still if she gives uncomfortable signs such as looking around, one word answers, it’s good that you leave and approach another girl. * However if she smiles back, and seems interested on the basis of eye contact, feeling comfortable and talking normally etc that’s a cue that she is interested. 5. Talk to her. Again, try to talk to her in the same way how you would talk to a friend but with more energy (as she is a stranger). Of course use common sense talking to a friend does not mean start swearing unnecessarily or being douchy. Think of a normal fun conversation with a new friend.	.

Be prepared mentally. Cold approaching is not quite a common method to meet girls to get dates or have sex with them, along with that not many people are comfortable with strangers so there is a good possibility of getting rejected. The rejection can be painful and may be embarrassing (which is nonsense and illogical) however if done properly you will realize this is one of the best ways to meet girls and have a relationship or have sex with with them. So keep some things in mind before you go out. 2. Be confident. Its very important that you are confident. Confidence not only is attractive but also gives you courage to approach and carry out a conversation with a girl you just met. Of course its easier said than done but practicing cold approach several times on a regular basis helps build confidence. 3. Try that rejection doesn't phase you. There's going to be rejections and this may cause you to feel pain, depression and other negative feelings, which is extremely irrational and illogical because you may perceive it negatively. Think of it this way there are 3.5 billion girls in this world and if few of them reject you, does it mean that there is no one who would like you for who you are? Is this the end of the world? Believe that you deserve it. 4. Don't care what people think about you. Yes its a cliche but very true. There will always be people who would dislike you and what you do. If you felt that what they think is true, you are shooting yourself in the foot and doing a huge disservice to yourself. Remember it matters only if you think it matters. 5. Keep benefits in mind. This is a method which is out of the norm and could be scary that’s one of the reasons the benefits are great and awesome. * Helps overcome fear which gives you a deeper inner confidence. * Helps in public speaking. 6.

Think logically and be deeply truthful. * There is a high possibility that you may ruminate about illogical and irrational things just before approach like ""what if she curses at me?"" Yes they are illogical and nonsense because it’s like mind reading. * The truth is you don't know how she might react when you approach her. * Don't feed yourself false stories and lies.

Dice up the frozen chicken. You can sear and cook frozen chicken on the stovetop whole but dicing or cutting it into strips will allow for quicker cooking time. * You can use the microwave to thaw the chicken a bit to make it easier to cut it up, but always use microwaved chicken right away. 2. Season the chicken. You can apply a seasoning mix, a sauce, or a salt-and-pepper rub before freezing the chicken or while it is thawing as it cooks. * You can also cook the chicken in a broth to add more flavor and prevent the meat from drying out. * Keep in mind seasoning put directly on frozen chicken will not absorb into the meat. 3. Place one tablespoon cooking oil in a pan. Use olive oil, vegetable oil, or even coconut oil. Feel free to use a pat of butter, as well. * Turn the pan to medium high heat and let the oil warm up or the butter melt. * Add in any broth, like chicken or veggie broth, if you are using it. 4. Place the chicken breasts in the hot skillet. Keep the temperature at medium heat. Cover the pot so the breasts can cook. 5. Cook the breasts for 2-4 minutes. Try not to lift the lid and peek at the chicken as it is cooking as this allows heat to escape. * Like baking the frozen chicken, cooking the chicken will still take 50 percent longer to cook than if it were thawed. * After 2-4 minutes of cooking, add in any spices or seasonings to the chicken. 6. Flip the chicken breasts over. Use kitchen tongs to do this. 7. Turn the heat to low and cover the pan. Set a timer for 15 minutes and let the chicken simmer. Avoid lifting the lid to peek at the chicken. 8. Turn off the heat and let the chicken breasts sit for 15 minutes. Once the chicken has cooked for 15 minutes, you need to let it sit. 9. Check the temperature of the chicken. Take the lid off and check if the chicken is done by using a meat thermometer. The chicken should be at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit. * Make sure there is no pink in the middle of the chicken breasts. 10. Avoid using a slow cooker to cook frozen chicken. The USDA does not recommend cooking frozen chicken in a slow cooker, as the low, slow cooking style creates an optimal condition for bacteria growth. * Even the highest heat setting on a slow cooker does not produce enough heat to keep chicken safe from bacteria growth.	.

Remove the gas tank under the carburetor by unscrewing the screw from the gas tank to the engine (usually held by a bracket), then remove the screws that attach the gas tank to the carburetor. 6. Clean the gas tank by making sure that the part where the carburetor was connected is free of any gook or grime, also inspecting the gas tank and freeing it of any dirt by using air. 7. Now remove the carborator by removing the two bolts (usually one ontop and one at the bottom) that attach the carburetor to the engine. Now that you have the carburetor out and in good sight, use a paper clip to clean the jets (on the bottom of the carburetor), then spray the carb cleaner into the carburetor and let it sit for 20 minutes. 8. Remove the side of the engine that the throttle was connected to by usually unbolting three bolts. 9. Inspect the inside of the engine, then find a disc that should have been exactly where the pull start is (when you remove the pull start it should be attached to the engine), find the magnetic side of that disc and make sure that it is clean and you can see the magnet. 10. Bolt the cover back onto the engine. 11. Attach the gas tank on ONLY. 12. According to your type of engine, you will have to manuever the carborator to reconnect all of the throttle linkage so make sure that all of the throttle linkage is connected before bolting the carborator. 13. Reattach the air filter mount (not the cover) with the four screws. 14. Inspect the air filter and decide if you need a new air filter (if the air filter is wet or moist, remove the air filter and buy a new one. Clean out the air filter mount and cover with air freeing any loose dirt.	.

CUSTOMIZE THE GRIP TAPE 2. There are many things you can do to alter the way your board's grip tape looks. 3. Grab a black and PERMANENT marker, Sharpies are great and dry fast but any permanent marker should do. Locate the Tech Deck logo on the grip tape and start dotting away at it with the permanent marker. Do NOT colour, just dot it, it looks alot better and doesn't wreck your permanent marker. Do this until you can't see the Tech Deck logo anymore. 4. You can also cut a line in the grip tape, but there are two ways: The hard way and the easy way, but doing it the hard way improves the result. We'll be learning about the easy way first, and then the hard way. 5. Easy Way 6. Grab scissors or a sharp knife and locate the two pairs of bolts on any end of the board (They are on the two ends of the grip tape) and look about half an inch closer to the middle of the board. Do slow, but sure vertical cuts on this area. The cut should be about a third of the width of your fingernail - approx. 5 mm in width. Make sure you cut the whole area vertically, as in no grip tape left in that 5 mm width of area. This looks pretty awesome and, if you wish, you can then colour the line with different coloured permanent markers, and then even go on to the rim of the deck! 7. Hard Way 8. First, you need to carefully take the grip tape off the deck but without ripping it. An easy way to do this is to soak the board in hot water for about 5 min. This burns out some of the glue holding the grip tape to the board.	Take your time when you do this, just don't rip the board. Once the grip tape is off, cut two parts of the grip tape off in the same area as shown under Easy Way. The two parts cut should be the same width as the line should be - namely, about 5 mm apart. Once this is done, carefully Superglue the two pieces back to the deck, with both of the ends covered in grip tape so the line is in the right place. It may then help to put the board in the freezer for sometime, so the glue hardens and therefore sticks the grip tape better. About 15 minutes should do, but 20 to 30 minutes is good if you really want to make it perfect. Done!

Jackson chameleons are not good for this. * Glue coarse gravel around the tips of the slate so the lizards have extra gripping power. * Air hoses and heater wires must not block the lizard from swimming. Glue them to the glass with just a few spots of glue above the water line to get them out of the way. * Gluing the slate properly (thick enough edges, clean/dry slate/glass, following glue instructions) should hold them for at least 7 years, the ones above the water line even longer. Don't touch them once glued, but if you need to, use minimal pressure. * Build an upper-level rock food dish, or 'pen' for the meal-worms. * It is more aesthetic to leave the entire front of the tank clear of slate but this leaves a side sans a beachhead but lizards will swim up against the glass and go to a corner. Make sure each corner has a smooth transition to land. * Amphibians can be used with (if the species get along!), or instead of, lizards. They are cheaper (no reptile heater) and easier to care for. * More slate must be glued above the beaches, for more real-estate. This can provide more surface area to run than traditional arrangements. It can also be more stimulating. The more elaborate the better, so create caves, etc. This can be done when the tank is operating, as cups, etc. can hold the slate until glue dries but should be done during step 3. * Rinse the slates often. * Only use a filter not requiring a full tank, such as an Eheim or sponge. The latter is fine and cheap, just change the water often. An undergravel filter is bad as cleaning it is too disruptive and the slate prevents its removal. * A lizard may thrive even without a reptile heater, as long as the fish like warmer waters, like tetras, etc. * Don't skimp on the glue (ONLY use aquarium sealant) though finish it smoothly, like grout. * This ""caving"" effect can be utilized with the traditional dirt substrate, having lizards, amphibians go vertical as well. * Water vapor will collect on the glass in the top 1/3 of the tank, obscuring the view, so drill SMALL holes in the CLEAR PLASTIC REMOVABLE FLAPS (if they exist) on the back cover of hood. NEVER drill tank glass. If unable to vent water vapor, magnetic algae scrapers can wipe it away. * A cork bark floating platform (often used for turtles) can compensate for some of the water level issues. It will rise and fall with the water level, assuring your lizard of a haul-out point even if the water level falls (like while you're on vacation). * You don't have to use slate, any rock or even 2 tiles glued atop each other can be used but it must be thick enough for the glue to hold it up and a flat side for a flush fit. * Slates at the water line MUST BE LEVEL with each other so it is easy to get to them after falling in the water. This cannot be over-stated. If some are a bit low, another piece glued on top might fix it. But a slate too high is no good."	But never remove glue you placed on one of the four original seals holding the tank together. Measure it right initially.

Make every effort to make sure the cat doesn't have an owner. Outdoor cats establish their own territories that likely include other people's properties, so just because you see them often doesn't mean they don't already have a home. If a cat is causing you problems, post signs in your neighborhood to give warning to the potential owner that you may take action. This allows the owner time to remedy the situation.center 2. Realize that most cats taken to animal shelters are not adopted and are therefore euthanized, so see if you'd like to keep any of the strays. A limited number of cats can be useful for catching gophers, rats, and mice, even if they won't make suitable pets. Be sure to have such cats tested for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV, aka feline AIDS) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV), vaccinated, and altered. You don't want your ""limited number"" to become a mob. If any of the cats test positive for FIV or FeLV, for the good of all the cats in the neighborhood, you must have a veterinarian humanely put them down, unless you are able and willing to adopt such cats and keep them inside only. If you own uninfected cats, this is not a viable option, since no cure exists for either disease. (Note: humans cannot catch either of these feline-specific diseases.)center 3. Rent or purchase a humane cat trap at your local hardware or pet store; most can be bought for around fifty dollars. Animal shelters may also have them to loan or rent. Such metal traps have doors that spring closed when cats step on the metal trigger inside, and provide the least possible distress and injury.center 4. Search for low cost spay/neuter options for feral cats. Most communities have them. Set up the appointment before you trap the cat. Make sure the cat gets an eartip to identify it as spayed.center 5. Position the trap under a roof so cats do not remain in heat or rain once caged. Never leave a trap unattended.center 6. Keep one door shut if there is doors on either ends, so larger cats must enter the trap completely. Place wet cat food, chicken, tuna, or liver behind the trigger pad so the cat has to walk over the trigger pad to get to the food.center *"	Use tie wraps to secure this in place so they don't knock it over trying to escape once trapped. Make sure the container doesn't have any sharp edges that could injure the cat.center

Go to a store that sells a variety of imported and microbrewed ales and lagers. 2. Determine which beers are bottle-conditioned. Bottle-conditioned beers have a layer of yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle, which can be seen when the bottle is viewed from the bottom. Yeast consumes the healthy plant constituents that are derived from barley and hops, so if the yeast are removed from the beer, much of the healthy constituents are removed. Also, yeast provides nutrients that alcohol removes from your body, such as B vitamins. You want the beers that have yeast in the bottle. 3. Determine which beers are dark or, if light in color, which ones are hazy. Dark beers use dark barley malt that enables the healthy hop constituents to remain in solution by binding to them. British stouts and porters use relatively large quantities of this type of malt. Haze or an obvious suspension of very small particles in light-colored beers may be an indication that there are plentiful quantities of polyphenols in the beer, or that the beer has not been overly processed. However, light, clear beers may be healthful, and very high in quality, but it is important that they be bottle conditioned. Some strains of yeast result in a murky yeast suspension in the beer, while other yeasts result in a thick, compact sediment and an otherwise relatively clear beer. Many healthful nutrients should exist in the yeast sediment. 4. Purchase some beers according to the above steps, and taste them. The beers that are more bitter used greater quantities of hops during the brewing process. More hops means more healthful hop constituents.	Also, when pouring beer into a glass, try swirling the dregs of the beer in the bottle and pouring the loosened sediment into your glass. This will help to ensure that you consume all of the available healthful nutrients. However, such a practice may not be recommended for certain styles of beer.

Go to a store that sells a variety of imported and microbrewed ales and lagers. 2. Determine which beers are bottle-conditioned. Bottle-conditioned beers contain living yeast, and have a layer of yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle, which can be seen when the bottle is viewed from the bottom. Living yeast will actively keep beer fresh by eliminating unwanted compounds, consuming harmful oxygen, and producing carbon dioxide. Yeast also absorbs and consumes the healthy antioxidant plant constituents that are derived from barley and hops. If the yeast is removed from the beer, much of the healthy constituents may be removed. Yeast also provides B vitamins, which are removed from your body when alcohol is metabolized. Some people may find beer yeast to be unpalatable. If so, step 3 is important. 3. Determine which beers are dark or, if light in color, which ones are hazy. Dark beers use dark barley malt that enables the healthy hop constituents to remain in solution. Dark beers that have been filtered and have not been bottle conditioned will still provide plentiful quantities of antioxidants, perhaps more so than unfiltered, bottle-conditioned light-colored beers. Filtered, light-colored beers do also provide readily absorbed antioxidants, but may be lacking in certain antioxidants. British stouts and porters use relatively large quantities of dark malt. Haze or an obvious suspension of very small particles in light-colored beers may be an indication that there are plentiful quantities of antioxidant polyphenols in the beer, or that the beer has not been overly processed. However, light, clear beers may be healthful, and very high in quality, but it is important that they be bottle conditioned. Some strains of yeast result in a murky yeast suspension in the beer, while other yeasts result in a thick, compact sediment and an otherwise relatively clear beer. Many healthful nutrients should exist in the yeast sediment and suspended yeast. 4. Purchase some beers according to the above steps, and taste them. The beers that are more bitter were made with greater quantities of hops. More hops means more healthful hop constituents. Beers with hop flavor and aroma will, however, provide a greater variety of delicate hop antioxidants. Dark beers need not be overly bitter, as the dark malt helps to keep significant quantities of healthful hop constituents in solution even though less hops may be used.	This will help to ensure that you consume all of the available healthful nutrients. However, such a practice may not be recommended for certain styles of beer.

Get a large cast iron or steel frying pan or skillet - one without a wooden or plastic handle that can go inside the oven. If you don't have one, use a medium size, lightly oiled heavy based roasting tin for the oven cooking, and a frying pan for the stovetop cooking. 5. Preheat the oven to 445F, 230C, gas mark 8. If you are using a different pan for the oven cooking, put it in the oven to get really hot. 6. Unwrap the beef and season with freshly milled black pepper. 7. Put the pan that you are using on the stove over a medium/high heat and add 2 tablespoons of oil. Allow it to get very hot until it just starts to smoke. 8. Keeping the heat on high, add the beef fillet to the pan and quickly sear one side, and then the other. This should only take a minute or two at the most to achieve a crusty golden seal. 9. Put the pan straight into the oven (or transfer to the preheated oven pan) on the middle shelf and roast for 10 to 15 minutes depending on how rare you like it. 10. While that's happening, cut the mushrooms into thick slices. If you are using the garlic (some folk prefer not to mix romance with garlic), chop it finely. Now pour yourself a glass of wine and relax for a few minutes. 11. When the chateaubriand is ready, remove it from the oven and carefully transfer to a warmed plate and cover loosely with a piece of tin foil.	.

He'll just learn it and the next thing you know, he'll be saying it all over the place. 5. Don't gossip about other people in front of him. As you know, little kids can be blabbermouths. He'll be telling the person you gossiped about all the things you said about him/her. 6. Let him know you love him. Some brothers think that you don't love them. Try giving him a hug or telling him you love him. 7. Spend more time with him. Taking a walk with him and telling him how you feel, would be good.	Maybe helping him with homework if he's in school.

Test the friendliness. Stick your hand in the cage and just hold it there. If the hamster tries to bite you, don't buy that furry little thing. If she seems a little afraid they are OK. Meeting new people isn't easy so they will probably be afraid. If you find a hamster that immediately shows affection you are lucky. But don't count on it. When you find the friendliest hamster that you want to buy move on to step number two. 2. Check the other hamsters that you are not thinking about getting. Are they diseased? If so don't buy a hamster from that place. Chances are your hamster will get that same disease later, right about when the pet warranty wears out. Are the cages clean? Do they have food and water? If the other hamsters aren't well looked after then you have a problem. Don't buy a hamster from that store. Kindly suggest to the workers (or breeders) that they need to care for the animals better. 3. Now check the hamsters' behavior. If they are sleeping, it is harder to tell how they behave when awake. If you are shopping at night, the hamsters ought to be active and nice. They should be alert and should be picking up noises. 4. Ask the employees for information on that hamster. How often are these little beings held? How often do people pay attention to them? Is the one you have chosen nice? Does it react well to strangers? Does it like people? What are its favorite things and foods? Ask them many questions so you can really be sure this is the perfect hammy. 5.	Is it run down or well kept? Do they care for the other animals?

First, go to the hamster section of the store. At that, pick at least 2-4 different types of hamsters that you seem to like. Between, they can be the same or not the same. 2. Great, now you have chosen your two to four hamsters! Now, have one of the employee to open the cage. If the hamster is on its behind legs than, watch yourself because it may attack you. 3. After that, ask the employee to pick up the hamster. Carefully, with two fingers, pet the hamster. If the hamster is comfortable, then that means he/she is okay with you and doesn't want to attack. Doing this makes the hamster realize that you respect it and that you don't want to harm it in anyway. 4. The next thing you want to do, is try holding it. If it moves around that's fine, as long as it stops soon. It means that he/she could not be in the right position for them. Also, if they do not stop it could possible be meant as the hamster isn't in a good position and doesn't feel safe in your hands. 5. Now that you have picked the right one, you can now take it home. If the hamster starts to bite the box it just means that he/she feels trap. It's perfectly normal. Anyway, once you have got it home, let it run around in his/her cage for awhile, so that he/she is okay with it, when they go to bed. Also, do not play with it for awhile, but do give treats from hand care. It gains more respect. 6.	Once, she/he gets used to it try playing with it by hand or so. Also, pet it a lot and hold it a lot. Feed by hand for two or three days to gain more respect!

Run towards the obstacle and start your jump. Approach the obstacle perpendicularly and straight on. Make sure you are also maintaining speed so you can clear the obstacle without any issue. The point of a dash vault is to skim over the top of an obstacle, rather than the up-and-over of other types of vaults. * Your speed will depend on the depth or width of the obstacle you are vaulting over. For example, if it’s a thin wall, you won’t need as much speed. However, if it’s a thicker surface, you will need to go faster to clear it. 2. Kick your legs forward when jumping over the obstacle. The trick is to bring one leg up first and then follow with the other quickly. This gives the illusion that both legs are coming up together. It’s important here to take off with your dominant leg or the one you are more comfortable with. * Imagine the way an athlete clears a hurdle; bend your dominant leg in a similar manner, slightly at the knee. Then, when you kick this leg forward, your other leg will naturally follow your momentum and you can bring it forward. * Make sure you are leaning back when jumping. Otherwise, your chest will prevent you from bringing your leg up for enough to clear the obstacle. 3. Put your hands behind your back. Wait until your behind has cleared the obstacle before putting your hands down on the edge of the item you're vaulting.	.

Choose_a_Good_Dairy_Cow_Breed.txt	Begin_Revision	0.964	## Steps	842	But as a hobby farmer you may not mind the time , money and feed invested in rescuing and caring for one or two cull dairy cows .	### Determining Your Needs	915	As a hobby farmer you may not mind the time , money and feed invested in rescuing and caring for one or two cull dairy cows .	<delete><But><1>|||<replace><as><2><As><1>	True	Steps  1. Determine the size of cow you want to have. Breed is a big influence on cow size, and size is a big determinate as to how much feed you want to spend to give to the animal. The bigger the cow is, the more you have to feed her. And the more you feed her, the more money you have to spend on feed. In other words, the bigger the cow, the bigger the feed bill. * Holsteins are one of the largest breed of dairy cows, and the ones that can be absolute monsters when it comes to feed. Jerseys are the smallest dairy cow breed, and may be a little easier on the pocket book. 2. Decide what temperament you want your cows to have. Can you handle nervous, flighty cows or would rather have the very docile cow that gives you next to no problems? By comparison, Brown Swiss cows are probably the most docile-nature dairy cow that any dairy farmer or hobby farmer could ever have. Holsteins tend to be a bit nervous, and Jerseys can be notorious kickers. 3. Determine how much milk you need or want from that cow. If you're looking to maximize milk production, Holsteins are the way to go. If you're only wanting milk for you and your family, you may want to consider a cow that doesn't give as much milk. Breeds that are dual-purpose (produce both milk and meat) may be ideal, but it's possible they may not produce enough. Dexters produce less milk, as do Ayrshires and Guernseys. You may also want a dairy cow for butter and cheese making. Jerseys and Brown Swiss produce milk higher in butterfat and protein content, making them ideal for cheese and butter making. Ayrshire and Guernsey are no different. 4. Choose how much you are willing to spend on a dairy cow. Dairy cows that have been culled from conventional dairy operations for various reasons are cheaper, but may be less productive due to mastitis that may have destroyed one or more quarters, lameness, or inability to breed back. If you are a dairy farmer just starting out, avoid these cull animals.	.

Slow your bike when approaching railroad tracks. Look for signs of an approaching train. You should see signs, like a sign with an X and RR written on it. Check for flashing lights, a person signaling a train, and a horn or bell from an approaching train. Even if there are no signs of a train, slow your bike. Crossing tracks at full speed on a bike can be dangerous. * Make sure you are in the appropriate spot for a bike. The laws may state that bikers stay on the road, or on a specific bike path. 2. Wait for the train to cross. If there is a train, you should stop your bike completely and wait. Do not try to race across the track before the train approaches. Either continue sitting on your bike, or get off your bike and stand next to it while holding the handle bars. Wait until the train has passed. Make sure another train is not coming. You are able to cross the tracks when the lights have stopped flashing, and the crossing gate has been lifted. 3. Know the risks of crossing the tracks on a bike. There are several risks you are taking when crossing railroad tracks on a bike. Knowing the risks before crossing the tracks will help prevent you from falling or becoming stuck on the tracks. The risks include falling into the gap next to the rail, falling in a gap perpendicular to the tracks, and sliding on the tracks. * Falling into a gap next to the rail happens when the bike tire is narrower than the gap between pavement and rail. Line your bike up perpendicular to the tracks to avoid falling into this gap. Do not cross it at an oblique angle. * Falling into the gap perpendicular to the rail happens because sometimes railroad crossing use coverings to make the railway smoother, but the coverings are made up of individual pieces that leave gaps. The gaps are often wider than a bike tire, which risks the bike tire falling into the gap. To avoid this, cross the tracks close to a 45 degree angle, instead of perpendicular. * Sliding happens on the tracks when they are slippery and/or wet. Avoid leaning the bike on slippery tracks.	.

Create_Interactive_Presentations_to_Impress_Students.txt	Begin_Revision	0.929	## Steps	43	Besides , Articulate and Wondershare provide robust flash authoring tools ( make flash from PowerPoint ) , and they both can incorporate with their own quiz tools seamlessly .	## Tips	69	Articulate and Wondershare provide robust flash authoring tools ( make flash from PowerPoint ) , and they both can incorporate with their own quiz tools seamlessly .	<delete><Besides><1>|||<delete><,><2>	True	Steps  1. An amazing interactive presentation always helps teachers and tutors to enhance their instruction. No matter you are a teacher or trainer, if you want to please your students or trainee with intriguing presentations, this is the right article for you. 2. Many people may understand the value of a good presentation for knowledge delivery, but only few of them do know how to make such one. Usually, teachers or instructors use PowerPoint to create courseware. Without a doubt, this is an easy and efficient way to help clarifying and activating the teaching content. But, a presentation only with words and pictures is not attractive enough to get focus. Fortunately, MS PowerPoint allows user to launch an external program, e.g. exe and flash, while playing slideshows. These elements may possibly bring clarity and fun to classes or lectures, but the problem is how many non-computer-science teachers or professors know to build those elements to content their students or audience. For sure, there are few. Then, how to create those interactive elements becomes the main hurdle to author attractive learning content or presentation. 3. Consider .exe first. What do .exe programs help? Take physics class for example. Usually, a VB based exe program is used to perform some physical phenomenon, e.g. beats, in phase, out phase, interference, diffraction and so on. Remember, these demonstrations are not only show the phenomenon, but also demonstrate the laws, which is more important than the phenomenon itself. In other words, the related parameters should be allowed to change to meet specify needs, such as, wave length, frequency, initial phase, etc. If not, a video would be more helpful. Ok, now the sticking point is VB programming. Oh, god, what a jerk! Luckily, in most conditions, those programs are universal for familiar content, for instance, a program demonstrate the phenomenon beats. The basic parameters would be possibly changed are frequency, amplitude, and phase difference. A program satisfying this is suitable for any class about beats. And, this kind of demos are available on Internet by searching ‘** demonstration’. Since it’s easy to get one, why bother to make one. 4. Then, flash. Flash is capable to manage most functions .exe programs can. Besides, flash is easier to please audience by visual animation looking than the .exe programs, and it is more acceptable in programming skill. Thus, the flash demo is becoming more and more popular. Just like exe programs, flash demos can be downloaded from the web, but only one element would never get an appropriate one from the Internet. That is quiz. This must be distinct from different individuals. Even in the same course, teachers would like to have their own quiz. Now the problem becomes simple, build a flash quiz to enhance the interaction of presentations. 5. Why quiz? 6. Quizzes can help reviewing knowledge, and solidifying the instruction. What’s more important is quiz is absolutely interactive. Furthermore, a good flash quiz will get students’ focus. Beyond all doubt, Macromedia Flash is the best choice to create the most impressive and exclusive quizzes, but if we take a compromise on appearance, we are possible to avoid programming. Articulate, Tanida, and Wondershare all provide powerful flash quiz tools. 7. Articulate QuizMaker (QM), the most powerful, also the highest price $399, quiz tool among the three. It is capable to build BOTH online survey and graded quiz. Friendly interface, users could start to make quizzes without a guide. There are 21 question types to choose, 11 for graded quizzes, True/False, Multiple Choice, Multiple responses, Match (drag and drop), Sequence (drag and drop), Fill In The Blank, Click Map (hotspot), Word Bank, Match (drop down), Sequence (drop down), Numeric, 10 for surveys and polls (Consider survey is not necessary for a class presentation, I only list the graded question types). 8. Tanida QuizBuilder (QB), $199, and Wondershare QuizCreator (QC), $99.95, less comprehensive than QuizMaker, are only focusing on the graded quizzes. The interface of QB is very neat, while the QC’s is very cute and pretty. The later one is more intuitive than the first. It is especially worth noting that only QC gives a question outline in the left part of its interface, it helps much on clarifying the quiz structure. They both provide 8 question types to choose. QB has the first 8 types of QM; QC has the first 7 types of QM, plus Short Essay. 9.	Turn PPT presentations to flash ones could reduce size dramatically, and can be played in computers without Office.

Parents must realize the seriousness of this epidemic and be outraged when they hear about any students being physically or mentally assaulted. They must band together and demand that the school take immediate action on this bully. After all, we would not tolerate an adult slugging a child in the back-with deliberate intentions on hurting the child as much as they could. So why would we tolerate a child doing the same thing to another child? It's assault and child abuse regardless of age. 2. The 'bully' should be immediately reprimanded from that school. If the bullying behavior continues despite repeated warnings, the bully should be expelled. The parents should seek therapy for this bully and find another school that they can enroll their child in. Bullies should be expelled if they persistently assault students despite warnings.	Then it should automatically be reported to local child services. But the first duty of that school is to get the 'bully' out of that school and ensuring a safer school environment in which kids will learn more and have a sense of security knowing that adults are looking out for them. The schools must take this epidemic more seriously or they will be responsible when a child dies at the hands of a bully. Parents must make sure the schools are protecting our children.

Create the figure. Subconsciously, we decipher the gender of someone based on his or her figure. This makes creating a ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" figure extremely important to cross-dressing. However, it is important to note that many cross-dressers simply ""blend"" the gender lines without fully committing to one side. For example, many men will cross dress without ""faking"" breasts or ""tucking and taping."" Similarly many women choose to not pad while cross dressing. So blend the gender line however you feel most comfortable doing so. 1. Give Yourself Breasts: One way to do this is to purchase a bra and ""stuffing"" it in the outer corners with either tissue paper or socks. This will push your pecks together while adding bulk. However, if you want to show cleavage, this is going to look obviously fake. To achieve the ""cleavage"" look, you can purchase fake silicone breasts that come in a bra-like construction or individual ""cutlets"" with adhesive. This will allow you to have breasts without needing a bra. 2. Adding Curves: Try using Shape wear, corsets, and ""booty bolsters,"" they can all bring in the waist and add bulk to the hips and butt. This is going to create an hourglass shape. 3. ""Tucking and Taping"": While there are expensive pairs of underwear that can ""hide"" your manhood, you an also do this quickly and cheaply with a pair of panty hose and some tape. Visit this article on wikiHow to Tuck and Tape. 2. Contour the face. Your facial features say a lot about your gender. However, with the right kind of make up, typically referred to as contouring, you can create an entirely different facial look. You can create illusions that make features looks smaller or more pronounced and you can even draw focus to certain feminine or masculine traits. * Feminine Face: Women have high cheek bones, bigger eyes, smaller noses, and bigger lips. Use contouring powder and highlighter to create these illusions. * Add Make-up. Apply false lashes, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner and lipstick to create the ultimate feminine look. 3. Do your ""hair."" While you can grow out your hair to naturally get the ""look"" of the opposite sex, you can also take advantage of wigs to create that look temporarily. Look online at celebrities to find the right hairdo for your new features. 4. Dress the part. Again, look at photos of celebrities of the gender you are ""crossing"" into. Be sure to get the right fit by trying on your clothes with your “new figure” on. You don't want to buy a dress only to find out it doesn't fit with your new cleavage. 5. Pay attention to the smaller details. It's more than just how a man dresses or a woman does her make up that makes them identifiable with that gender. There are dozens of little differences or ""red flags"" that signal that you are a cross dresser. If you are looking for the obvious cross-dressing look, you can skip pass these tips. If you want to be the other sex down to the smallest details, read on! * Exposed Body Hair: Men and women expose body hair differently. Waxing, using panty hose or shaving can turn a man into a more realistic woman. * Nails: This is an obvious, but a sometimes overlooked detail. Give yourself a manicure to achieve the look you want. * Accessories: Belts, necklaces and earrings aren't unisex. Try shopping in the male or female sections of stores to get the authentic look. 6. Get the attitude. Being a cross dresser may be all about the aesthetics to you. If so, the following tips may not mean much."	.

An ace bandage, a two-sizes too small sports bra or the control top of a cut up pair of panty hose, can give you a flatten and smooth look. NOTE: binding too tight or for too long can cause serious health problems. 2. Hiding Curves: In many cases, there isn't much a woman can do (other than binding) to create a masculine figure. The easiest tip is to always wear loose clothing to prevent emphasizing curves. In the long term, going to the gym can create a more masculine figure. Build your chest, arms and legs to create more ""bulk"" on the body. 3. ""Padding"" Yourself: Padding can be done to look realistic with prosthetics or it can be done by just adding bulk with extra fabric. 2. Contour the face.

It's more than just how a man dresses or a woman does her make up that makes them identifiable with that gender. There are dozens of little differences or ""red flags"" that signal that you are a cross dresser. If you are looking for the obvious cross-dressing look, you can skip pass these tips. If you want to be the other sex down to the smallest details, read on! * Exposed Body Hair: Men and women expose body hair differently. A woman growing out her leg hair or no longer shaving under her armpits can ultimately make a difference. * Nails: This is an obvious, but a sometimes-overlooked detail. Give yourself a manicure to achieve the look you want. * Accessories: Belts, necklaces and earrings aren't unisex. Try shopping in the male or female sections of stores to get the authentic look. 6. Get the attitude. Being a cross dresser may be all about the aesthetics to you. If so, the following tips may not mean much."	.

Look at the title. To understand a poem’s meaning and theme, you should begin with the title. Poets carefully choose their titles to set up their poem. Does the title provoke a certain feeling? Does it set up a certain expectation for the subject? 2. Decide the who, what, when, where, and why of the poem. Thinking about this set of criteria will help you begin to discover the subject of the poem and what the poet is trying to communicate to you, the reader. * Who’s the speaker of the poem? You should remember that the poet is not always the narrative voice in the poem. Are there multiple characters in the poem? Who’s the speaker’s audience? * What’s the basic plot of the poem? Are there conflicts present and are they resolved? * When does the poem take place? Present time? In the past? Over a long period of time or in a single night? * Where does the poem take place? Is there a physical location? In it an imaginary environment? * Why is the speaker of the poem speaking to you? What has compelled the speaker to share this poem? 3. Think about the poem’s rhythm. Reading the poem aloud was a good place to begin understanding the rhythm of the poem. Now that you’ve thought about the poem’s subject and intent, look more closely at how the poem’s meter (regulated or repetitive beats of words in a line) or rhythm contribute to its meaning. *	.

Use a sturdy holder. Catfish can pull with an enormous amount of force. If you aren’t careful, some of the bigger fish could easily pull you under with their strength. For this reason, it’s important to use a holder when fishing for channel catfish. * If you are fishing from the shore, anchor the holder to the ground so that your pole will be connected more securely. If you are fishing from a boat, anchor the holder to the side of your boat. 2. Wait it out. Channel catfish can be very lethargic, so be patient. You aren’t likely to get a hit right away. As with most fishing, it takes time and patience to catch channel catfish. 3. Watch for the signs. When your line straightens, the fish has your bait. Let the fish pull the slack out of your line before you start reeling. Set the hook and be ready to use your strength because these fish can and will fight until subdued. 4. Adjust your methods with the seasons. Channel catfish behavior, as with most living things, varies from season to season. Knowing how to alter your fishing methods based on their seasonal behavior will greatly increase the likelihood that you will catch one, no matter what season you fish in. * During the late winter and early spring, channel catfish prefer deeper water because it is slightly warmer. So during this time, try using a bait with a strong rotting odor (like cut bait). * During the spring, summer, and fall, channel catfish are one of the only fish that can be caught in high stream flows. In these warmer months, melting snow and rain water cause the water levels to rise.	.

Tie your slipknot. The slipknot is the start to your crochet pattern – the knot that holds the yarn to your needle as you work. To tie the knot: * Drape the yarn with the tail end in the palm of your hand, wrapped around the top of your index finger and under your middle finger. * Wrap the yarn back over the top of your index, behind the first loop. * Pull a loop from the center of the piece of yarn, and tuck this through the center of the large loop you’ve made around your fingers. * Place the new small loop on the crochet hook, and pull the tail of the yarn to tighten it. 2. Create your foundation chain. The foundation chain is simply the first row of chain stitches you create. Because you’re crocheting a hat, the foundation chain will not be very long – only five stitches to start.  * To crochet your first stitch, hold the tail end of your slipknot and slide the hook forward, so that there is plenty of space on the end. Wrap the yarn around the end of the hook once, and then pull the hook backwards through the original slipknot. You’ve completed your first stitch! Repeat this five times to create your foundation chain. 3. Make a slip stitch to join your end to the first chain you made. This will finish your foundation row, by hooking it back in a loop. Stick the end of your hook through the center of the first stitch, and do a single stitch (as per usual).  4. Crochet in the round. This is the phrase that means to crochet a small circle – the base for your hat (the part at the very top). When you pull the hook through, you’ll have started a second row that is adjacent to the first, in a spiral. 5. Crochet your second row using a double stitch. From now on, you’ll have to use a double stitch for your hat. This will attach all your new rows of stitches to the spiral in the center, so that you don’t end up with multiple loose rows. * To do a double stitch, you start with your hook with a single loop on it. Slip the hook through the loop and into the chain under/next to it (attached to the spiral). You now have two loops on your crochet hook. Finish by doing a regular stitch; wrap the yarn around the hook, pull this yarn through the two loops on your hook. You’ll always end with a single loop on your hook when you complete one double stitch. 6. Mark your starting point. As you crochet, you’ll need to keep count of your stitches.	There are two general methods for marking the starting point: tie a piece of string around the first stitch in the second row, or slide a bobby pin over the stitch. When you get back to this part of each row, you will know you’ve completed an entire row of stitches.

This will get rid of any damage or split ends. If you don't want to visit a hair salon you can always trim your own, of course. 3. Replace your brush with a wide-toothed comb. It is easier to damage curly hair with a brush, whether wet or dry. Untangling hair while dry with any tool is not a good idea; separating the curls dry just causes more frizz. Instead of a brush, switch to a wide-toothed comb, or even better, just use your fingers (when the hair is wet). Using your fingers to untangle curly hair helps to bring out the curls much better than running your hands over your head to prevent frizz. If it is difficult to untangle your hair this way, add more conditioner to your hair when wet or trim any unruly ends. 4. thumb|sham + poo =phony + poopStop shampooing your hair.

These common detergents found in shampoos make curly hair frizzy and uncooperative. Conditioner can be used sufficiently to clean the hair (see the next step). Also, more gentle shampoos that contain mild cleansers (i.e. cocamidopropyl betaine or coco betaine) can be used occasionally or more often for wavier hair types. * ""You'd never dream of washing a good sweater with detergent. Yet most shampoos contain harsh detergents (sodium lauryl sulfate or laureth sulfate) that one also finds in dish washing liquid. They're great for pots and pans because they cut grease so effectively. Your hair, on the other hand, needs to retain some natural oils, which protect your hair and scalp. Stripping them away deprives the hair of necessary moisture and amino acids and makes it look dry and dull."" - Lorraine Massey500px * 200px|leftTo the left is an image of a shampoo and a bottle of dish detergent. Above, the same sulfate is circled in their ingredients list. 5. Wash your scalp with conditioner (conditioner washing). Begin your routine by wetting your hair in the shower. Distribute conditioner on your entire scalp and massage your scalp with the tips of your fingers (not your fingernails). This rubbing action and the resulting friction will loosen dirt, product residue, and dandruff which can then be rinsed away. (Be sure to avoid silicone in your hair products, see the Warnings.) Thoroughly rinse your scalp afterwards, still massaging with your fingertips as you do so. Depending on how dry your scalp is, you can conditioner wash, once a week, twice a week, or every day. * ""The curly-haired can leave their hair hydrated with natural oils and clean their scalps quite well by rinsing only with hair conditioner once a week or less. Rubbing the scalp firmly with fingers is enough to loosen dirt."" - Lorraine Massey 6. Distribute conditioner throughout all of your hair and untangle gently. Use your hands or a wide-toothed comb. Start by untangling bottom sections of your hair and then gradually move upwards. Let the conditioner sit in your hair for five minutes or so for extra moisture. You also may want to part your hair at this point with a comb. It's recommended that you part your hair to the side to prevent ""triangle-shaped"" hair. 7. Do the final rinse of your hair with cool or cold water. This will decrease frizz and add shine. Leave some conditioner in your hair, especially in dry sections like the ends. It's fine to run your fingers through your hair gently, but do not comb your hair after this point. 8. right|180pxApply products to your hair. Do this while your hair is soaking wet if you have curlier hair, but wait five minutes or so if you have medium to wavy curly hair. Put product in your hands and rub them together to emulsify. Then, smooth or rake the product into your hair by sections. A common method is to begin with a leave-in cream or conditioner to decrease frizz and then follow with a gel for hold and definition. (Using your normal conditioner as a leave-in is fine too.)"	Next, finger shape the curls by scrunching them (cup your hair in the palms of your hands and scrunch in an upward motion) and/or twisting individual curls around a finger.left|220px

Trim and file your nails 1-2 times a week to reduce the amount of fungus. Nail fungus occurs when the nail beds are moist or wet for an extended period of time. To prevent the fungus from getting worse, it is best to cut your nails to your fingertips once or twice a week. In addition, file your nails regularly to keep them even and smooth. * If you don’t cut and file your nails, your nail may start to lift up from the fungus. 2. Paint your nails with antifungal polish 1-2 times a week. Amorolfine and tioconazole are antifungal medications commonly used in fungus nail lacquer treatments. Purchase this over-the-counter at most drug stores. Follow the instructions exactly as indicated by the packaging or recommended by your doctor. * It may take up to 6 months of constant application for the polish to work. 3. Apply topical medication daily to treat your nail fungus. To relieve fungus and relief pain, you can purchase topical antifungal treatments to massage onto the infected areas. Read the instructions on the packaging regarding how often and how much to use. Typically, you apply a tiny bit to the infected area 1-3 times a day. *	.

Do an oil soak once a week to lock in moisture. Pour about 1 cup (237 mL) of a natural oil into a bowl, and dip your fingers into the oil. Let your nails soak for 10 minutes, and massage the oil across your nails as you wait. You can use olive, coconut, argan, vitamin E, tea tree, or castor oil. * In addition, you can soak your nails at night and wear gloves to bed for a deep moisturizing effect. * Avoid using vegetable or canola oil, as they make your hands greasy. 2. Use cuticle oil whenever your fingertips are dry. You can apply cuticle oil 1-3 times a day as needed. Apply 1 drop of oil to each nail, and massage your nail bed with your other hand. This keeps your cuticles soft and moisturized, which is helpful when you want to strengthen your nails. * If you don’t use cuticle oil, you may develop hangnails or dry skin. * Avoid using cuticle scissors to cut off the skin around your cuticles. Instead, use a cuticle pusher to move them backward. This keeps your hands healthy and avoids hangnails. 3. Rub on hand cream every night before bed to keep your hands hydrated. You can use a lotion specially formulated to moisturize your hands, and you can also use any body lotion for basic hydration. Use a dime-size amount of lotion or more as needed, and massage the lotion over your fingernails and hand. This way, you’ll wake up with soft and supple skin. * Keeping your skin hydrated helps your nails grow healthy and strong. 4. File your nails in 1 direction to smoothen and remove rough edges. To strengthen your nails, it is important to file your nails correctly. Avoid “sawing” back and forth over the tip of your nail. Instead, move then file consistently across your nail in 1 direction. Start on the outer edge, and bring the file towards the center.	This way, your nails can grow back strong and healthy.

Decide where to start your search. If your employer, college, or university provide you with a search engine or directory, begin there. However, in most cases, you’re best bet is to start your search with a major public search engine, such as Google, Bing, or Yahoo. * Know what a search engine is — and isn’t. Search engines crawl the web indexing pages by reading the words and phrases that appear on those pages. From there, the process is automated. Each search engine has an algorithm that’s used to rank results for specific searches. This means that no human is vetting the accuracy of the results. The “top” result is simply the result of an algorithm. It’s not an endorsement of the content or quality of the result.	Moreover, each search engine has its own algorithm. So the “top” result on Google will not necessarily be the “top” result on Yahoo, even with the exact same search phrasing.

In some instances, the agency may direct you to an online searchable database. * For example, the City of New York allows users to search for property records online using its “Automated City Register Information System (ACRIS).” 3. Request the deed in person. If you cannot find a deed online, then request it in person at your local Recorder or Assessor’s office. * You will have to pay a fee. The cost could run from $2.25 a page in Washington, D.C. to $4 a page for a certified copy in New York City. 4. Contact a third party. Typically, when a deed is recorded with the county, a copy is returned the buyers agent.As such, if you are the property owner and have misplaced or never possessed the property deed, contact the real estate agent, lawyer, or title company who processed your closing. 5. Use property tax statements. The legal description of a particular piece of property may also be located on the annual property tax statements prepared by the City or County Tax Assessor’s office. For instance, the property tax statements prepared by the Tillamook County, Oregon’s Assessor’s office may contain the legal description of the property. * Not all jurisdictions include the legal description of property on tax statements. *	Clarify with your City or County Assessor’s office that the description contained on the tax statement is the “legal” description of the property before relying on it to make important transactions.

Use the most effective dental floss. There are several varieties available and you can choose the one that best matches your personal preference, including waxed, unwaxed, flavored and unflavored. Here's what you need to know to make a decision about which type of floss is best for you: * Floss comes in two basic forms: * Nylon (multifilament) floss. This floss is made up of many strands of nylon fabric, making this stringy and possible to break apart. Nylon floss comes in waxed and unwaxed. * PTFE (monofilament) floss. This floss is made up of a single strand or thread, and glides in between even the tightest of spaces. * If you have wider gaps between your teeth, then tape floss may work best. * Single-filament floss is slightly more expensive, but it will be able to slide between teeth more easily and will be less likely to shred. Each container of floss lasts a long time, so using non-nylon floss is a worthwhile investment. 2. Wrap the ends of an 18-inch to 24-inch section of floss around your middle fingers. * Many people like to floss after brushing. This will allow the toothbrush to start removing the stray particles of food from your teeth before you even begin to floss. However, brushing your teeth after flossing may allow more fluoride from the toothpaste to reach between teeth 3. Hold the floss between your thumbs and forefingers of both hands. You should leave about 3-4 inches (7.5-9 cm) of the floss exposed. This is the area you'll be using to floss your teeth. Once you wrap the floss around your index fingers, you can grab it with your index fingers and thumbs. Your thumbs can be more helpful in flossing your upper teeth and your index fingers can be more helpful in flossing your bottom teeth. 4. Use your thumbs to floss your upper teeth. Use your index finger to floss your bottom teeth. 5. Gently slide the floss between your teeth. It doesn't matter which tooth you start with as long as you cover every tooth before you finish.	Once you've picked an area, slide the floss gently between your tooth and the gum line. You should do this carefully instead of being too aggressive, or you'll increase the chances of bleeding or hurting your gums.

Be Conscious of Your Appearance. * If you want to flirt with guys, the first thing that you need is to pay attention to your physical appearance. You should wear something that looks elegant, clean looking, comfortable, and at the same time, makes you feel confident. Remember, you don't need to have millions of expensive clothes to look beautiful because some simple fashions never go out of style. Try sporting dark, slimming jeans, a simple solid colored tank or cami, some chunky bead necklaces, or a cute sun dress. 2. Groom Yourself Beautiful. * Be sure that you shower and clean yourself regularly. You should also wear deodorant, shave frequently, clean your ears, brush your teeth and hair, and you could try to paint your nails. Also, try to wear your hair in a style that makes you feel pretty and use a perfume that smells sweet, but is not too overpowering. Two sprays on the neck and one spray on one wrist, then rub your two wrists together to transfer the scent. 3. Give Him The Opportunity To Approach You. * Don't stay in a group. A guy may find it a little uncomfortable to approach you if you are in a large group of people. No man can bear a rejection in front of a herd. Also, he may feel that he can't approach you because of your friends. *	Also, try to minimize the distance between the two of you. For example, you can sit at the chair next to him.

Make time for your children!! 2. Children learn speech and language through listening, watching, exploring, copying, initiating, responding, playing and interacting with others. For those first few years most of the important interaction is going to be between the child and their parents, carers and maybe siblings. Finding time to spend with your children and have a shared focus is very important if you want to help them to develop their speech, language and social skills. One-to-one time will benefit your child in the long term. 3. You are doing your child a disservice if you have spare time, but put them in front of the TV. There are a few (and only a few!!) children's TV programs that are in any way educational. Your child is more likely to learn about things from one-to-one playtime with his parent or carer. TV and video games are passive entertainment and do not encourage any interaction. Studies now show that children who watch too much TV in their early years are more likely to have difficulties with attention and listening when they reach school age. 4. There is also evidence to show that if the child uses a dummy/pacifier their speech can be delayed. Speech can be delayed because the child is not speaking, and because the development of the child's oral musculature may be affected by the constant sucking of a dummy. 5. Building an environment that helps language flourish 6. Building a language rich environment is about using every opportunity to use language, to interact, to share a focus, to talk, to take turns. Building a language rich environment is also about building a nurturing environment, giving your child love and affection and building their self-confidence. And finally, it is about building a learning environment, creating a place where love, language and learning can all take place together. 7. So what do you do to create this environment? Well firstly look at yourself and how you are communicating: 8. Remember your language level 9. One of the biggest things to be aware of when using language around your young child is the level and complexity of the language you use. Think about their age and how much language they use. A young child will generally understand more words than he uses in speech. You can use a milestones chart to have a broad idea of your child's language level. Assuming your child is developing along normal lines think about where to pitch you language. For instance, if your child is aged 2 years and 6 months and is able to follow a short instruction containing 2 key words, be mindful of this when you talk to her. If you use long sentences she will not understand you. If your child does have difficulty understanding, just use key words, more intonation, and gesture, or point as you say the words. 10. When talking to your child, try to talk about things that are in context or that the child can see, so they can use these things as a reference. Talk slowly and put emphasis on the key words if they are in a sentence, and use lots of intonation to help emphasize meaning. Give the child more time to respond than you would with older children or an adult. Younger children may need a little longer to process your speech and formulate an answer of their own. This is even more important if your child has difficulties acquiring language. If your child has language difficulties, or receptive language delay, limiting your words, giving them lots of time to process language, and using lots of gesture is essential. 11. Take a step back and feed in language 12. You can enhance your child's development of language by sometimes taking a step back during play and letting them take the lead. This gives the child control of their environment and builds their confidence. Although you are still involved in the play you are not dictating what is happening. However, you can still be feeding language into the play as it is happening. So the takeaway here is not to feel you have to fill in any gaps of silence, just watch and listen and add language. For instance, if your daughter is playing with her dolls, just watch, add language to her words and dictate some of her actions. 13. Chloe: dolly tea 14. Mum: the dolly's drinking tea, and that one is having a sandwich 15. Chloe: sandwich 16. Mum: mmm sandwich, whats it got in it…jam, a jam sandwich mmm 17. Chloe: mmmm sandwich 18. Mum: mmmmm jam sandwich yummy 19. Chloe: more tea 20. Mum: more tea for dolly and teddy is drinking tea too 21. Chloe: cake 22. Mum: oooh, are they getting cake too, yummy 23. Chloe: yummy cake 24. Mum: yum yum yum eating lots of cake (rubs tummy) 25. This is a simple example and although mum is only adding a few new words she is acknowledging her daughters words and she is expanding on her sentences. Chloe can hear her words being put into longer more grammatical sentences and a couple of verbs are added (eating and drinking). Chloe remains in charge throughout the game, she leads the game and the dictates what is happening. This situation allows her control so there is no pressure on her to communicate and the communication environment is a relaxed and nurturing place. 26. The language you use during play 27. Children do not learn language by having an adult continually asking them to name various items. Children learn by hearing words and linking them to things. So it is a good idea to feed language into play, rather than asking your child to name every toy they are playing with. Adding language is an easy thing to do and can be done in all types of different situations, not just play. You can comment on what the child sees, commentate on what your child is doing, or expand on what they have said e.g. 28. Child: car 29. Adult: that's right, it's a car, a fast car 30. or 31. Adult: that's right, it's a car, a red car,and there is a blue car 32. Child: cat 33. Adult: yes, the cat is climbing (gesture the actions, and emphasize the key words cat and climbing) 34. The other way to add language is to describe what your child is doing during play. For instance, if your daughter is playing with her dolls in the dolls house, give a little commentary: 35. Jane: dolly 36. Dad: dolly's going in the house 37. Jane: sit 38. Dad: dolly's sitting down 39. Jane: drink 40. Dad: dolly's got a cup, she is drinking tea drink tea 41. Jane: tea 42. Dad: yes, dolly is drinking tea… and now she is eating cake 43. The temptation here is to ask a question, such as “what is dolly doing” or “what is dolly drinking”. This immediately puts the emphasis on the child, and they then have to stop their play and respond. By just commenting, you are not putting any pressure on your child to communicate so the play is more relaxed. The child is also able to play on their own terms and control the game. 44. Having a shared focus 45. The above examples show the importance of having a shared focus. This is important because not only are you giving the child a point of reference when you talk about things, but the child is learning listening and using attention skills. These skills are vitally important for the child when they attend school and the early years are key years for developing these skills. The best ways to develop these skills is to spend time with your child, talk and play with child, and have a shared focus. 46. Try and develop a shared focus with your child whenever you are engaging in communication. 47. Share the moment and look at things together. Make sure you are at the child's level and have good eye contact. It is important to notice what interests your child and what they are focusing on, and then comment on it. This helps create a shared focus, shows the child that you are interested and allows them to link language to the things they are looking at when you comment. 48.	If you are able to acknowledge and understand your child's attempts at speech it encourages them to attempt more, and at the same time you are providing a good model of the speech. If you can't understand your child, repeat back her word, but at the same time point to things you think she may be trying to say.

Since this procedure causes a blister, performing it on a foot can lead to discomfort that interferes with normal walking and weight bearing. Also plantar warts tend to be deeper than other warts because the weight bearing action pushes them inside. You will need to freeze them more times, using less nitrogen on the cotton bud each time so that the freezing goes deeper and does not cause a wide blister. * The procedure works best for smaller warts, about the size of a pea (4mm) and smaller. In principle, larger warts may be handled by freezing one pea-sized piece at the edge of the wart, then waiting for the skin to heal completely (about two weeks) before attempting a second freezing. Under no circumstances should you freeze wider areas, as this will result in a large, painful blister, with a real risk of infection. * This procedure is suitable for common warts or moles with a clearly defined boundary. There are other kinds of lumps that can be tumors of varying degrees of malignancy. You should be sure that your warts or moles are the harmless, slow-growing and non-invasive ones. You should consult a doctor if your wart or mole is large, grows quickly, changes color, looks inflamed or swollen, or is painful to the touch. * This procedure may involve minor pain or discomfort. You may prefer to request the services of a dermatologist or it will grown into a dark brown ball because of the liquid nitrogen burn. * Liquid nitrogen can be dangerous. Laboratories using it for research require users to wear special cryo-gloves, goggles, gowns and shoes, and to follow special handling procedures. It is also an asphyxiation hazard: if knocked over in a closed space, e.g., a car or lift, a 2L container of liquid nitrogen can evaporate instantly and reduce the oxygen levels of 3 cubic meters of air down to 10%, an oxygen concentration at which a person can pass out and asphyxiate without warning. Such measures are not usually seen when visiting a doctor for cryogenic wart removal. The chief risks to the home experimenter are spills onto clothing and into shoes due to the wicking action of clothing that holds the liquid nitrogen in contact with skin. Splashes into the eyes are a concern because liquid nitrogen can spatter when it spills. Goggles (not safety glasses) are usually recommended. Spills onto bare skin are less of a risk. Due to the Leidenfrost effect, it is possible to briefly plunge one's hand into liquid nitrogen without injury. * Do not do this by yourself! Go see a dermatologist (skin doctor). If you freeze too much, you can cause yourself serious and permanent damage to the skin, nerves, and other nearby tissues. It's very easy to scar yourself if you don't know what you're doing.	The differences are very nuanced and only a professional dermatologist would be able to notice.

Prepare while you are in prison. If you are currently incarcerated, take advantage of opportunities to get your G.E.D., start or complete your college education, or get vocational training. Good preparation is especially important if you have been away from the outside world for an extended time, if you have limited job skills and experience, or if you will not be able to return to your previous area of employment (for example, if you were a bank teller and were convicted of theft, you probably will no longer be able to work in banking). 2. Take advantage of education or job training programs that may be available to you. Government agencies and non-profit organizations provide a host of opportunities for all job seekers to get more training or education. The experience and skills you develop in these programs can make a big difference in the success of your job search. There are also such programs targeted specifically to people who have recently been released from prison. These programs usually also help you find a job during the program and after completion. 3. Eliminate jobs for which your record will automatically disqualify you. Your record may automatically disqualify you for some positions, especially government jobs requiring security clearances, military jobs, positions with fiduciary responsibility (i.e. insurance or banking), and jobs working with children. If you avoid wasting time on jobs you cannot possibly get, you’ll be able to focus on real opportunities, and you’ll be less likely to get discouraged. Most importantly, though, do your research. Don’t just assume that your record will disqualify you from a certain job. You may be pleasantly surprised. 4. Be realistic. Honestly evaluating your qualifications is important for all job seekers. You need to find something that fits you and your skill level, and if you consistently apply for jobs for which you don’t have the right skills, you’ll quickly become discouraged. If you have a criminal record, you’ll need to consider how that affects your opportunities, too. 5. Start small and work your way up. Understand that when a person sees your record, he or she may be reluctant to hire you for a position with a lot of responsibility. That same person, however, may be more than willing to give you a chance in another (usually lower-paid) position. In addition, it’s important to understand that the biggest obstacle may be the gap in your employment history, not simply your conviction. If you want to return to your previous career, it’s likely that business processes and tools may have changed substantially since you left your last position, so you’ll probably need to take a step down to gain more training. Get your foot in the door, especially with a company or in a field that can lead to better opportunities in the future. 6. Learn about the employment laws in your state and/or country. In some countries (including the U.S.), employers generally cannot automatically disqualify you based solely on an arrest or even a conviction (if the nature of the crime is relevant to the job, however, they may lawfully base an adverse hiring decision on this). This is why applications that ask if you’ve been arrested or convicted of a crime usually have a disclaimer stating that a “yes” answer may not necessarily prevent you from being hired. Know your rights, and consult an attorney or make an Equal Opportunity Employment (EEO) complaint if an employer unlawfully discriminates against you. 7. Be honest about your history. It can be tempting to lie when an application asks if you’ve been arrested or convicted of a crime. Avoid the temptation: not only is this dishonest, chances are the lie will be discovered. Most employers now conduct some sort of background check, and if they find that you have been dishonest on the application you will almost certainly not be hired. If you’ve already been hired and the lie is discovered later, you can be fired for it.	.

You are limited only by your imagination. Think about what you’re good at and what you like doing, and go for it. * You’ll probably need to have another job while you’re getting your business on its feet. 2. Consider joining the military. Some people think that the military will take just about anyone, while some think that you can’t get in at all with a criminal record. In the U.S., they’re both wrong. * Depending on the type, number of offenses, and the length of time since your offense, you may be able to get a waiver that will allow you to enlist. However, don't expect to get a waiver if you display antisocial behaviors or if you can't get good references from community members. * Before you enlist, consider the potential risks and benefits of joining the military. The military can provide job training and instill discipline. * Lying to a military recruiter about your criminal history is a felony—don’t do it. 3. Volunteer. Even if you can't get a paid position to start, volunteer work looks good to employers. It can even count as job training for many professions and the department of social services.	That experience could take you farther than actual job experience.

Introduce the quote with a colon. Place a colon at the end of the sentence that leads up to the block quote.	.

Introduce the quote with a colon or a comma. Place a colon or a comma at the end of the sentence that leads up to the block quote, depending on what’s appropriate. Use a colon when the quote is a continuation of the thought. Use a comma to show what the author said. Examples are shown below: * Sam Dean longed for the wide open space of New Mexico: (your block quote will come next). * In his novel White Jacket, Herman Melville argues, (your block quote will come next). 2. Start the block quote on a new line. After you’ve introduced your quote, begin the quote on a new line. This sets the quote apart from the other text. 3. Indent the quote by ½ inch (1.27 cm). Moving from the left margin, you’ll want to indent the entire quote by ½ inch (1.27 cm). For most computers and writing applications, you can achieve this indent by hitting the “tab” button, or using the space bar 5 times. * If you are citing multiple paragraphs, indent the first line of the quotation by an additional ¼ inch (0.64 cm). * Indent the first line of each successive paragraph the same way. * Follow block quote formatting for two or more paragraphs, even if there are less than 4 lines in each paragraph. 4. Maintain the spacing. MLA and APA formats call for double-spacing throughout the main body of the paper, and you will want to keep this spacing for the block quote. For CMS, you can either single-space or double-space the quote. 5. Skip the quotation marks. Because you are starting the block quote on a new line with indentation, you don’t need to add quotation marks to set it apart from the rest of the text. Don’t italicize or alter the text in any other way, simply set it apart from the rest of the text. 6. Add your parenthetical citation after the closing punctuation mark. It’s very important to properly cite where the original quote came from, and the way you add the citation depends on the style. * For MLA, you can express this with parentheses after the last sentence in the quote. The first time you quote a work, put the author and the page number in parentheses. MLA formatting doesn’t include the “p.” before the page number.	He found new inspiration near the sea.

Maintain the spacing. MLA and APA formats call for double-spacing throughout the main body of the paper, and you will want to keep this spacing for the block quote. For CMS, you can either single-space or double-space the quote. 5. Skip the quotation marks. Because you are starting the block quote on a new line with indentation, you don’t need to add quotation marks to set it apart from the rest of the text. Don’t italicize or alter the text in any other way, simply set it apart from the rest of the text. 6. Add your parenthetical citation after the closing punctuation mark. It’s very important to properly cite where the original quote came from, and the way you add the citation depends on the style. * For MLA, you can express this with parentheses after the last sentence in the quote. The first time you quote a work, put the author and the page number in parentheses. MLA formatting doesn’t include the “p.” before the page number. For example, John was eager. He found new inspiration near the sea. (Marshall 78) * For APA, the first time you quote a work you need to put the author, year, and page number (denoted by “p.”) in parentheses, separated by commas. For example, In one study, the scent of lavender was shown to reduce stress by 20%. (Jones, 1998, p. 112) * Unlike MLA and APA formatting, CMS uses footnotes to cite references.	The footnote should contain the author’s name, title of the work, publisher, and date, in that order.

Introduce the quote with a colon or a comma. Place a colon or a comma at the end of the sentence that leads up to the block quote, depending on what’s appropriate. Use a colon when the quote is a continuation of the thought. Use a comma to show what the author said. Examples are shown below: * Sam Dean longed for the wide open space of New Mexico: (your block quote will come next). * In his novel White Jacket, Herman Melville argues, (your block quote will come next). 2. Start the block quote on a new line. After you’ve introduced your quote, begin the quote on a new line. This sets the quote apart from the other text. 3. Indent the quote by ½ inch (1.27 cm).

Get a copy of your school’s dress code and read it carefully, and look for loopholes. Make sure you fully understand the dress code, and ask an administrator for clarification if necessary. You don't want to buy something and then find out you can't wear it to school.center 2. Go through the clothes you have now and see what you have that fits within the guidelines of the dress code that you will actually wear. It helps to organize your closet by what you are and aren't allowed to wear to school. This way, when you wake up in the morning, you don't have to shuffle through all the clothes you aren't allowed to wear in order to find what you need for school that day.center 3. Pay attention to little things in the dress code that aren't restricted. For example, you may have to wear shirts that have collars and sleeves. While that certainly limits you, it doesn’t say anything about pockets vs. no pockets or button fronts v.s. polo shirts. Find something you are comfortable in that fits within the dress code. In this example, if you don't like polo shirts, get button fronts. Sleeves can usually be any length as long as they’re there. No matter how restrictive your dress code, you’ll likely have some choices.center 4.	That means, even if you have to wear uniform pants etc., there's nothing that can stop you from pulling a colorful skirt or skort over them. Try wearing multiple layers of shirts, pants and skirts, or jackets over the uniform. If worst comes to worst, you can still pull the extra clothes off. center
Do_a_Doll_Style_Look_for_Halloween.txt	Begin_Revision	0.946	## Steps	59	Then add a bit of white eyeshadow in the corner of your eye and closest to your eyebrow .	### Eyes	91	Add a bit of white eyeshadow in the corner of your eye and closest to your eyebrow .	<delete><Then><1>|||<replace><add><2><Add><1>	True	Steps  1. First you have got to prepare the skin! Rub in moisturiser with your fingers. They are natural brushes that you are born with. This makes it a lot easier to apply makeup. At first you will look oily, but don't worry - that will go soon! And if you are having a long night (that could be at a Halloween party or trick or treating) you would like your makeup to stay on for a long time. So use primer! This could add on an extra few hours of keeping that doll-like look. Do this after applying the moisturiser. 2. Now you have to put on the foundation. This gives you the flawless look, any doll has. It would probably be better if you could apply it with a brush rather than your fingers, because your fingers hold a lot of grease. Foundation recommendation: MAC. Brush recommendation: Expert Face Brush by Real Techniques. If you have this brush, use it to buff in the foundation. This is the best way of applying it. If you don't have a brush, you will have to use your fingers but that's fine. To completely make yourself look fake and doll-like, you will have to go over all the nooks and crannys on your face with some concealer. This is only if the foundation didn't go over everything. Or maybe you don't have any spots, which means you don't have to do this. Finally, to set the foundation and concealer, you will need powder. This mattifys your look. The foundation probably makes you look shiny, and sticky. And it will be more likely to run. Whereas, when you use powder to top it off, you will not experience any of these things. 3. Now you're onto your eyebrows. If you wanted to make them look completely different, you could have put a gluestick on them and foundation. Then you could draw a completely different shaped eyebrow. But however if you don't want to go through that, you could just trace your own eyebrows. For this, you could use an eyebrow pencil, or kit. Or you could even use eyeshadow! Do whatever you usually do. Dolls don't have specific shapes for their eyebrows, but they are usually quite high up on their face. 4. Now onto the eyes! This is the most interesting part. First, you get a purple eyeshadow and put that onto your eyelid. Then a slightly lighter purple (or lilac) colour, getting closer to your eyebrow. Make sure it is all blended together. Make it lighter as it gets closer to your eyebrow but make sure there is always eyeshadow there. You wouldn't usually wear this to a day out but because you are being a doll, it's okay.	Then blend it again, altogether. You want there to be a gradient. Then add liquid eyeliner. You don't want there to be a massive wing, just a thin line going along the top of the eye and a small wing. Too much eyeliner covers the eyeshadow which is the main focus. But it is just enough to give the eyelashes a more full look. Then you want to get a white kohl eyeliner pencil and put it along the waterline. You also want to draw a semi circle under the eye making it seem like the eye is bigger. Fill that in with the white eyeliner. Then outline the semi-circle eye with some liquid eyeliner and draw on a few long bottom lashes with it. Apply some black mascara onto the top lashes (or a lot!). Don't apply any to your real bottom lashes because that is not where your eye is supposed to end. It would also be a great idea if you wore fake eyelashes, because dolls have perfect eyelashes.

Put on clothing and get out a towel or two that you're not afraid to stain. Prep your bathroom or kitchen (or where ever you happen to be dying your hair) by clearing your counter space; remove any items from the area that you might not want to get dye on.

Visit some of the nearest thrift shops that sell clothing in your area. Talk to someone there. They'll be very happy to take it out of your hands from you. A few agencies that could take this include the Salvation Army, Vietnam Veterans and almost any other thrift store. 4. Open your search up to trying major federal organizations. The American Red Cross will only be able to help you make the donation, if they are being donated in bulk amounts for fair distribution. However, there are other organizations that may want to use them, but you'll need to perform due diligence on these. Some well known organizations are ""for profit"" with little or none of each donation providing benefit to the needy. 5. Look online. There are some donation-program pages online that list where the nearest drop-box is located. 6. Look online for mail-in donation programs. Some donation programs can even take your donations by mail, but look a bit around, to ensure this is the thing you really want to do with the aforementioned item. 7. Give them to some local charities that might need them. Go through your town and just jot down some of these charitable places. Look for a social-services type of business. They'll hand these things to a reputable place who can take and redistribute them to other people who desperately need them! 8. Give them to someone who has just been through a recent tragic house fire and seems to have no clothes available to wear. Although some places nearby your house might need some clothes after a very devastating fire can at least feel a little comforting to know they have some clothes to wear, they will be very generous in taking the offer comfortably away from you."	.

Clean up your bed. You need it to lay your clothes on. It is good to have an overview. 2. Open your closet doors and take a while to look at it. How is it possible to have nothing to wear when all of my clothes don’t even fit in the closet? When you believe there is something in there you will be more open minded to find it. 3. Take out all of your dresses. I DO mean all of them. This is actually a good moment to clean out your closet. You can categorize them under three options. * The first one is “Never going to wear this again”. The clothes that are in this category should be neatly folded and kept apart. Use a garbage bag or a box. You can give them for a good cause or maybe sell them on the Internet. (I prefer giving them to a good cause, but if you’re short of money it might be a good idea to sell them.) * The next category is “Nice but not Christmas appropriate”. Those dresses should be put back in your closet for another occasion. * Last category is “I could wear this for Christmas”. Those dresses stay on a pile on the side of your bed. 4. Take out all your skirts and do the same thing. Ditto for your shirts, cardigans, tights, shoes, pants, etc. When you’re selecting your pants it might feel inappropriate to wear jeans with Christmas, but a dark washed or black pair of jeans can be very sophisticated paired with a chic top and pumps. So don’t be too rigorous. Don’t forget to do the same thing with your jewelery. Maybe you won’t have to go over each pair of earrings, but it can be a good thing to check them out for earrings or necklaces you forgot you had. 5. Now you know your options. Maybe one of the dresses or tops feels like a better option than all of the other clothes that are still on your bed, maybe not. When that is the case, see what you can combine it with. Do you have matching tights? Do you want to wear this top with a skirt or with pants? And which one looks nice together? 6. Make different outfits and try them on. I found this nice necklace that had exactly the same colour as a pair of tights I almost forgot I had. I wanted to pair it with a L.B.D. and it turned out the necklace didn’t look nice with it. Shortening the necklace did the trick, but doing that a week before Christmas is better than stressing on the day itself. As for me personally, it gives me peace knowing (instead of thinking) I have a perfect outfit ready to wear. 7. Pick your outfit for next Christmas. * Perhaps you need more outfits for different parties. Don’t think you can wear a dress or pair of tights twice. The only thing you can wear twice are shoes and accessories. Clothes can get sweaty or smelly and tights can get ripped. You don’t want to stress because of that. Pick an outfits for every party. This way you know for sure you have something to wear. Unless there will be enough days in between to clean up your outfit. 8. Pick out your jewellery. 9. How will you be wearing your hair? Do you want it to wear it down or up? Which hair accessories will you use? Do you have a nice bow, rhinestone hair-clip(s) or head band? It’s Christmas! If you cannot go wild with accessories those days, when can you? 10. Shoes. Very important. Those can make or break your outfit. Consider colour and heel. Is the party you’re attending a dinner party, than you can probably wear sky high heels. You won’t be walking a lot anyway. As long as you can come and go without falling and preferably walk elegant to and from the dinner table than rock that amazing pair of heels you never wear because they hurt so much. (You can put them off under the table, that gives possibilities…) 11. Will you be walking a little more or stand for a while, choose shoes that are comfortable or promise yourself to keep smiling at all costs. You don’t want to ruin your appearance by your face showing how much you’re in pain. 12. And as finishing touch: Nail polish is important If you’re like me, you have ten different colours already.	If you don’t have one this is one of two items you might need to buy. The other is hair/skin spray-on sparkle. Choose a cheap nail polish in the right colour. It only needs to last for one evening and being ten times more expensive doesn’t usually mean it stays on ten times longer. Don’t splurge on this one, spend as little as necessary.

Find ways to express themes in the script visually. Don't let the script only ""speak for itself;"" The best movies are thematically related on all levels, writing, storyboarding, sound, acting, etc. It is your job to take a good script and turn it into great visuals. Each scene, ask yourself what the goal of the scene is, the mood or tone, and the most important props, characters, or moments to draw attention to. * Find the most crucial element of the scene, and find a way to draw the audience's attention to it in each shot, making it bigger, centering it, panning into it, etc. * Gene Wilder wasn't a storyboarder, but he thought like a visual comedian. In Willy Wonka, the famous intro where he ""accidentally"" trips, falls, and rolls to raucous applause was drawn up by him as a way to portray Wonka as fun, strange, and hiding behind a comic facade without even speaking. 2. Avoid flat, two-dimensional compositions by always angling the camera. What you don't want is a completely flat floor, where the camera is at a right angle to the ground. Tilting the shot slightly gives your board three dimensions, even if it's a slight shift. Straight on shots are almost never as exciting as dynamic, 3D compositions. * Use the foreground and background to your advantage as well -- don't put every character or thing on the same depth line. * Don't forget about the far, far background either -- it is a good place to create depth. 3. Provide motivation to cut the camera instead of just changing the shot. Sometimes this is obvious -- if another character is speaking, you need to cut to show them. If someone hears a noise behind them, you cut to the location the noise came from. Yet not all cuts are so obvious."	.

Dress formally. If anything, overdress. If you’re not sure what to wear in Italy, you are more likely to come close by overdressing, not underdressing, as Italians appreciate style. After all, Milan is a fashion capital. * Italians tend to consider the entire picture when judging how you dress. They aren’t going to be thrilled by sloppy dress, such as wrinkled shirts. They will value good fabrics and fitted looks. * Capri pants are a good choice for women; Italians may wear shorts only at resorts. Men rarely wear very short shorts outside of vacation. * If you’re wearing a suit, put on a tie with it. You should probably skip the track suit or sweat pants. It’s going to look too informal for Italy. Pack business casual clothing for your vacation, something you’d be willing to wear to work. * Avoid baggy clothes. Italians are partial to tight clothing, or at least clothing that is nicely fitted. So skip the slouchy shirt or baggy jeans. Italians do wear jeans though, but they would pair them with a dressy top. 2. Wear nice shoes. Italians will study your shoes, and they may make judgments about you based on how your shoes look. Leave the flip flops and Crocs at home. * Choose a high quality fabric or leather in your shoes. Make sure that your shoes are in good shape. Get them shined! Pay attention to comfort, too, though, if you’re going to be walking long distances to see the sites. * Italians will recognize designer labels in shoes as well as dress. They will likely be impressed by your taste. Tennis shoes and cheap flip flops are not considered nice shoes and will mark you as a tourist. If you’re female, think of leopard-patterned flats or simple ballet style shoes. You can’t go wrong, though, with nice leather shoes. * Wear high heels at night when dining out if you’re female. There are some restaurants that won’t let you in if you’re wearing flat shoes. Wedge shoes will be easier to walk in than stilettos. If you’re not in a city, though, you might want to forgo the heels because you could encounter cobblestone streets. 3. Change your dress for the evening. Italians dress differently for the time of day. You’ll want to consider changing your dress when day turns to night. Try to bring a pair of long pants with lighter fabric for hotter months. *	It’s considered more elegant to not wear shirts that have collar buttons or breast pockets. If you’re going out to dinner or are in a fine hotel, you should dress in a more sophisticated fashion. For example, you might not want to walk around in a tank top, shorts, and flip flops.

Arrive on time. You don’t want to be late. Lawyers are very busy, and they might only have set aside 15 minutes to meet with you. If you are running late, then call up the lawyer’s secretary and explain where you are. * You might need to reschedule. Try to block out half a day, if possible, where you don’t have any other engagements. 2. Discuss your situation. You should let the attorney guide the discussion during the consultation. He or she knows what information they need. There should also be some time for questions. Make sure to ask the following: * The possible resolution to your case. Also ask what the lawyer considers to be a good resolution. * How the lawyer would defend you. Would you need to find people to write character reference letters for you? Do you need expert witnesses? * What to expect of the investigative process. What happens next? How long does it generally take? 3. Ask other questions. There are other questions you should ask to find helpful information. Don’t ask a question if you can find the answer on the lawyer’s website (such as where they went to law school). However, you might want to ask the following: * How much of their practice is devoted to appearing before professional boards, such as the Ohio Nursing Board? * Do they have any special qualifications (other than being a lawyer) that make them uniquely qualified to represent you? For example, the lawyer might be a nurse him or herself. * How do they communicate? Do they prefer the telephone or email? * Who do you contact in an emergency? Sometimes the attorney has staff who are more available and can get in touch with the attorney. 4. Discuss the lawyer’s fees. Another important area to cover is fees. Attorneys generally charge by the hour, but you should get as much information about fees as possible. For example, ask the following: * Are there any alternatives to the hourly fee? For example, some lawyers might represent you on a fixed-fee agreement. In this situation, you pay a set fee. * Does the lawyer have assistants, such as paralegals, file clerks, etc. Do they bill as well? How much do they cost? * Are you charged for photocopying, mailing charges, etc.? * Does the lawyer want some money upfront before agreeing to represent you? If so, how much? * How often are you billed? Every month? * What methods of payment does the attorney accept? For example, does he or she accept credit cards or cash? 5. Write down your impressions. After meeting with each attorney, you should take a few moments to gather your thoughts and write them down. You will want to compare candidates, and you might not remember the details of your meeting a week or two down the road. 6. Choose a candidate. There is no one way to pick a lawyer. Each person has different needs.	You will probably want to consider the following:

Completely open the top of a 1/2 gallon milk carton and rinse it out well. If desired, crease each of the walls out slightly to give the container a more rounded shape, and to allow for thicker ice formation. Be aware that while thicker ice will take longer to melt, thinner ice will be easier to see through. 2. Place a full bottle of vodka in the container. Make sure that your bottle of vodka will fit in it with room to spare. You can use any vodka bottle that fits or looks best, and refill it or top it off from a different bottle if desired. 3. Fill the milk carton with cold tap water. The water level should come up to the base of the neck of the vodka bottle. * To make the ice much clearer, use filtered water that has been boiled and cooled twice. The boiling removes air in the water as well as minerals, while the filtering removes various impurities, all of which cause the opaqueness of ice. Alternatively, buy distilled water and boil it once to remove the air, then cool it. Pour the water carefully and gently to minimize any splashing, as air will become trapped in the water when it is agitated.	Be aware that the ice will still have a tendency to form cosmetic cracks that will make it less clear.

The date of manufacture should be within a month, or the expiration date should not yet be passed. * For the first few times, buy dip in pouches. They are much more convenient and easier to use than loose dip. Skoal Bandits are recommended, since they are smaller portion pouches. Do not buy fine cut the first time. It is hard for most dippers to control. * Don't try snuff until you become more used to the nicotine. You are warned. * Thoroughly clean out your mouth with water or some other drink afterwords. There's nothing worse than feeling the slight nausea from the initial dip, then swallowing a mixture of dip spit and leaves. * Wintergreen flavored dips, and certain brands (such as Grizzly, Stokers, Longhorn, and Hawken) will give you what dippers call ""Gator Lip"" which is when the gum's get wrinkly * For your first dip, stay away from the stronger dips such as Copenhagen and Grizzly. Try Skoal or a cheaper brand such as Longhorn or Husky. These have less nicotine and will give you a less ""head rush"" (buzz). * Don't spit it out on the floor or anywhere else that someone might step in it."

Look for difficulty breathing. One of the primary symptoms of pyothorax is your cat having issues breathing. When a cat develops pyothorax, pus fills the chest cavity. In turn, the lungs cannot expand, which makes it difficult for the cat to breathe. * Your cat will likely have its mouth open, and it will breathe in quick, short breaths. Breathing may be painful, as well, and you may notice that it uses its sides more in breathing. * If you notice blue gums, it's time for an emergency visit to the vet, as that denotes a severe lack of oxygen. 2. Pay attention to disinterest in food. One symptom of pyothorax is your cat isn't eating properly. In fact, you may even notice your cat has lost some weight before other symptoms become severe. * If your cat ever stops eating, it's a good idea to take them to the vet, as it's usually an indication of an underlying problem. * It's possible your cat may have other related problems, such as vomiting and dehydration. 3. Notice fever and lethargy. You may notice your cat is running hot due to a fever. In addition, your cat may exhibit other common signs of fever and sickness, such as low energy and depression. 4. Watch for odd positions. Because your cat is having trouble breathing, you may notice it's sitting in odd positions. It may take a ""bulldog stance,"" with the front legs wide apart. You may notice the cat has trouble sleeping because it has to keep sitting up to breathe easier. It may also take a hunched-over position. 5. Understand the causes. One common cause is any penetrating wound on the chest, including bites from other animals and stab wounds from any foreign object. It can also happen if your cat swallowed something that penetrated the area internally, leading to infection. It's not always possible to pinpoint the causes of this issue."	.

So endeavor to do them, but not alone or in mere human strength -- seek and find the Holy Spirit, the Energy of God. * Do not fail to find the energy and power in the Aramaic name , that English speaking Christians call Jesus, the Messiah, so that you may know the fullness of the blessing of Abraham through Jesus Christ (Yahshua) meaning Yahweh is salvation (Arabic speaking Christians call Jesus Yasou’,from Yeshua.) Do not overlook the authority of Christ as your Savior. * Check into the energy revealed in Biblical prophecy -- ""Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure ... I have purposed it, I will also do it. Hearken to me, you stouthearted, that are far from righteousness."" Isaiah 46: 9-12."	.

Decide why you want to do it. I don't care if you just want attention, people go through that at some point during their life. 2. Pick a time period, you need time to prepare for the event. If it is in the morning, wake up early, if it is during P.E, ask to go get a drink or go to the bathroom. 3. Do your make-up, you need to look pale, not red or pink-cheeked. So if it is during P.E do not work that hard, or else it will be obvious it is just a fake. Put on layers and layers of pale eyeshadow on your eyes, put on layers and layers of REALLY pale blush. Then put on a light layers of grayisha brown eye-shadow underneath your eyes, making it look like your eyes are sunken in. 4. Start complaining quietly about not feeling just right. Do not over complain or else your friends will know your just faking it, and/or you are just a cry baby. 5. Gradually slow down in whatever you are doing, if you are in your desk writing, look up and start to waver. If you are walking in the hallways, start to slow down, then start staggering at a speed. But not too fast, we do not want you going to the hospital for a broken skull. 6. After you start staggering or wavering, come to halt. Now here is the hard part. The actual fainting part. Fall straight forward, or buckle your knees and flop down. 7. Many people do not know what buckling your knees is, so I will explain this for you, cross your legs, and drop your up torso last.	.

It brightens the skin, gets rid of dark circles under your eyes, and refreshes your skin while you sleep. So beauty sleep really does exist! * People with dry skin should avoid using hot water on their skin, as it often makes skin feel tight and dry. * Being in water for excessive periods can dry out skin as well. When you are in a pool, you actually sweat more than out of water, and this can cause your skin to be less hydrated and itchy. Most pools also have chlorine which can sting and irritate skin too, so reduce swimming pool sessions. * Don't have the time to go out to buy a moisturiser? Just mix a teaspoon of oil (such as coconut or avocado), with 2 teaspoons of honey and about 2 teaspoons of rosewater, and pour into a small container. This moisturiser is natural and gentle on the skin, so you could add bigger amounts of the ingredients so there will be more applications of it. * When choosing your daily cleanser, pick a gentle creamy one that is alcohol free. Foam cleansers can be drying. * Always remember to be happy with the skin you're in! * Are you not to keen on plain water? Prefer something with a little flavour? Just squeeze the juice out of some of the fruits mentioned earlier and add to a glass a water. It'll taste great! * Are you on the way to school/work while reading this and have dry skin but haven't done any of the above? Don't worry, there's one thing that will save your dry skin in the mean time. Vaseline, petroleum jelly or aloe vera gel! Most girls women, and sometimes men have this kind of thing with them at all times. They'll soothe dry patches and relieve dry tight skin. * As water is one of the key things for moisturised, hydrated skin, whenever you use moisturiser, splash your face first, and without petting it dry, apply your moisturiser. This will help the water soak in. * Look up healthy recipes which involve fruit and veg with vitamin A, B and C in them (for skin repair and renewal), and are water based (for hydration). Some vegetables include carrot, celery, cucumbers, peppers and spinach, and some fruits are strawberries, oranges, grapes, blueberries, tomatoes and apricots. * You might be in a rush, but when using your cleanser, one of the most important things to do is massage it in. This will stimulate oil to produce in your skin. * If you're at home at lunch time, why not cook up an omelet with peppers and spinach on top, then blend some of the fruits mentioned or a healthy smoothie snack? Or maybe try a homemade soup with some of the vegetables mentioned or add some of them to a stew or casserole, and make a fruit pavlova, tart, salad or ice cream for desert? You could even just sprinkle some chopped fruit or veg mentioned over some of your favourite dishes! *	So why not walk to school? Or take a walk round the park in your lunch break? Or maybe take the time to go for a jog after work/school. You could end up developing a new hobby!

Prepare. Sit comfortably in a chair or in your bed before starting. Make sure you are undisturbed, and then take several deep breaths to center yourself and relax. Crystal Sphere Massage can done with yoga or meditation practice to increase relaxation and increase the pain relieving effect. Consult the following definitions related to Crystal Sphere Massage: * Trigger Points- localized tensions inside the muscle tissues that most often occur on certain locations in the muscle, and are a result of continuous contractions in the muscle fiber. When touching them, they feel like knots or strings. A trigger point is painful, but you may immediately feel release by pressing them. It is a natural reflex to touch such spots to relieve pain. They are usually along the center line of a muscle. The number one purpose of Crystal Sphere Massage is to remove muscular trigger points, which, as a result, leaves the muscle smooth, flexible, and relaxed. * Acupressure Points- places on the meridians that are located near the skin. The subtle energy system describes 12 or more meridians and other subtle energy organs and channels in the body. Acupuncture points are those points on the meridians that are accessed by acupuncture therapists with an acupuncture needle. Such points may not be as near the skin and not available for acupressure. Acupressure points are not the same as Trigger Points. Both types of points are helpful for relieving pain and discomfort. The aim for applying pressure on the Acupressure points is to open blocked energy channels (meridians) and remove the blocked energy stagnant in the point. 2. Know the components of a muscle. A muscles consist of muscle fibers composed of numerous microscopic units (sarcomeres) surrounded by a inter connective tissue called fascia. Muscles attach via tendons on our skeletal bones. * Pain: Any physical sensation that a person deem painful. Pain can be graduated along the scale mild pain to unbearable pain. Pain can be localized or diffused all over.	In addition there is mental-emotional pain, and spiritual pain.

Feel the texture of the bill. People who handle money many times, such as cashiers etc... can identify a lower-quality fake bill instantly just by feeling it. You may not have that much experience, but just about everybody has handled enough money, that they can detect many counterfeits simply by feeling the texture, and paying attention (the paper that bank notes are printed on is not sold commercially; furthermore, the composition of the paper and ink is confidential). Genuine currency has slightly raised ink that is produced in the intaglio printing process. You should be able to feel the texture of this ink, especially if you are holding a new dollar bill. * The paper that money is printed on has slightly changed since the implementation of cotton rag. While money rag now has colored filaments, the traditional feel of money was intentionally left unchanged over the decades, because of its distinctive feel. The feel of a bill made 50 years ago should feel similar to a brand new dollar bill. 2. Compare the bill with another of the same denomination and series. If the bill feels all right, or if you are a little suspicious but unsure, hold the bill side by side with another bill. Different denominations, obviously, look different, so get a note of the same amount.	.

Swimming pools, a hot tub dance contests and even karaoke contests are just some of the activities that you can do. Even if you are considering to bring your own family, professionally trained child care staff that offers free activities to them can help you with this so that you can play in their casinos. 2. When it comes to the cruise’s meals, they have specifically designated theme restaurants, beverages, except for alcohol, are included, and most cheap cruises have food available 24/7. They also have pool tables and internet access if you feel that you cannot live without accessing the web. 3. To be able to book the cruise discounts you need, is to wait as long as possible for the cruise to sail, up to two weeks before sailing time if you can.	Most cruise lines are loathed to have any of their ships set sail with empty cabins. If you wait until the last minute to do your reservation, you can even get as much as fifty percent on your fare. You may not be able to get an ocean view cabin, but if your only purpose for the cabin is to just change clothes, showering, and sleeping, it will not matter since most passengers spend most of their time outside their cabin and not inside.

Be knowledgeable about the foods you're foraging. Above all, it's very important that you're absolutely certain that you're collecting food that is edible and safe. Mushrooms can be deadly if they're not the edible kind as many are poisonous, and the best avoidance of ending up with a poisonous look alike mushroom is doing a spore print. ( Spore Print! ) Selecting the wrong chestnut and you've got yourself something entirely inedible and unpleasant. Even not knowing whether or not foods have been sprayed for weed control is important if you want to avoid pesticides and poisons. If you don't know whether or not a food you find in the wild is safe, the advice is to not collect or eat it. Alternatively, you could ask for local advice from people who do know or go along with an expert forager who is well versed in what's safe and delicious to forage for in your area. David Fischer has a great mushroom and edible guide or the National Audubon Society has several guides as well. * If a nut is damaged, has been bitten by a squirrel or other animal, or has been broken in the fall from its tree, smash it and leave it for the birds and squirrels. It should not be used for food. * A plant identification guide can be helpful. However, even with this it is not always clear and local knowledge may be the only assurance when you're comparing photos with the foods you've gathered. * Avoid foraging where there is likely to be contamination from traffic, pollution or agricultural run-off. This means being particularly careful around streams, roadsides and near industrial sites. Also consider that certain edibles are good to eat if grown on certain vegetation, like the sulfur shelf mushroom is ok grown on certain trees, but not on others. 2. Be considerate. As well as ensuring that the food is safe and good to eat, ensure that it's legal to collect the food from the places you're going to and that it's free-for-all. If you're rummaging through a local farmer's produce, they're not going to be too happy and if they catch you, you could be prosecuted for trespassing and theft. Where food is abundant and freely available, don't be a hog; only take what you need and can use and leave plenty for other foragers and for the animals that need that these foods to survive. Eat prolific species and be sure to leave endangered species well alone. If possible, follow the mantra of ""take half, leave half"" so that the plants continue to grow and reproduce. * Obtain permission from the owner of the land before gathering food items from land that is owned privately. The rules on entering land vary depending on your jurisdiction and some countries are more tied up in private ownership than others, so it pays to know your rights with respect to roaming around private and public lands. There are some good websites outlining the laws relevant to foraging, so take a moment to read them. 3. Dress appropriately. If the weather is cool, be sure to dress warmly; at this time of year layering can be helpful to enable you to cool down or warm up quickly, dependent on weather changes."	And for the most part, it's a really good idea to wear gloves to protect your hands from thorns, stains, allergic reactions and beasts that might be lurking where you're sticking your hands.

Prepare foods before eating or cooking with them. Whatever food you find, be sure to prepare them before storage or use. Some handy things to bear in mind include: * If the food is wet, allow it to dry before storing or it will risk rotting. * Wash dirt and debris off food before cooking or eating and remove any parts that are unsuitable for consumption or blemished. Allow for drying of any washed foods before storage. * You may need to remove outer shells, husks or other layers of protection prior to storage or use but what you remove is dependent on the food found. * Some foods will perish quickly, such as berries, so they need to be either eaten fresh or quickly turned into , preserves or sauces for longer term storage. 2. Go mushroom picking. Mushrooms are a typical find in the fall season. Chanterelles (also known as ""forest gold"") are found in a number of forest locations but their whereabouts is often a carefully guarded local secret! Other mushrooms usually around in the fall include giant puffballs, ceps, oyster mushrooms, hedgehog fungus, field blewits and horse or Portobello mushrooms (these latter have many poisonous look-alikes, so be careful). Mushrooms can be eaten simply raw in salads, cooked in butter or made into soup, pate, risotto, vegetarian burgers and more. * See How to pick mushrooms for more details on collecting mushrooms and How to cook with mushrooms for more ideas on what to do with them. 3. Collect apples. Apples are ready for picking during the fall season and there are plenty of varieties. Finding apple trees for foraging depends on where you live but there are plenty of apple growers who are happy to open their orchards for self-picking for a small fee, so you can still take advantage of gathering your own under those constraints if you can't find wild-growing trees. Once collected, there is an abundance of things you can do with the apple in your cooking, including making apple pies, apple crumble, apple sauce and even making cider from them. * See How to use apples for more ideas. 4. Find wild fruits such as plums, crab apples and persimmons. These ripen for autumn harvesting and are often found growing in the wild. Crab apples make delicious crab apple jelly or , while persimmons are delicious eaten when ripe. Plums can be eaten as they are or turned into puddings, cakes, jam, chutney and even wine. * Crab apples: How to make crab apple jelly. * Plums: How to cook plums, plum chutney, How to make an eggless plum cake, How to bake a plum cake, plum jam and How to store plums. * Persimmons: How to eat a persimmon. 5. Pick berries. There are various berries ready for picking in the fall. Depending on where you live, these include blackberries, wild cherries, lingonberries, elderberries, sloe berries, mulberries and sea buckthorn. Wild cherries are smaller than their domesticated counterparts but avoid the very bitter ones as these can contain trace amounts of cyanide. Berries can be turned into pies and tarts, jams, jellies, sauces, chutneys, smoothies, puddings, desserts and baked into cakes and cookies. And don't forget to add them homemade ice cream! * See How to forage for blackberries for more information on getting them in the wild. Some recipes include How to make a blackberry pie and How to make a blackberry cobbler. * Sloe berries can be used to make sloe gin. * Be aware that the leaves and stems of elderberries are toxic and some people also suffer adverse reactions to eating the raw berries. Wear gloves when picking and cook the berries if in doubt. 6. Gather nuts and seeds. Many nuts and seeds ripen in the fall and provided you get to them before the squirrels and other local wildlife does, you can stock up your larder with some delicious finds. Just be sure to take only what you need and leave plenty for the animals who rely on these energy-packed sources of food."	.

Divide your hair down the center of your head. Use a comb to create a smooth middle part. You can use the teeth of the comb or the tail of the comb if it has one. Go slowly, making sure that your part is straight. Comb each side until it is smooth. * You may want to use the long end of a rat tail comb to make a clean part. * Your hair will be easier to braid if it’s still slightly damp, but you can still braid dry hair. 2. Tie 1 side of the part with a hair tie. Wrap a ponytail holder or scrunchie around the hair on one side. This will keep the hair separated into a part so that you don’t accidentally pull hair from that side while you work on the other braid. * You can also use a hair clip if you’d prefer. 3. Separate the unbound side into 3 sections, starting at your scalp. Start your braid as close to your hairline as you can. You do not need to have all of the hair in your hand when you get started. Just pull small sections from near your scalp. You will pull in the remaining hair as you braid. * Try to keep the 3 sections equal in size to make the braid look more uniform. 4. Create a left, middle, and right section. This will help you keep track of which section of hair you should be weaving. As you braid, the sections will change position as you cross them over each other. 5. Weave the left section across the middle section to begin. Adjust the middle section so it is over to the left side. Pull your hair tight to stabilize the braid and prevent flyaways. 6. Weave the right section over the middle section to continue the braid. Adjust the middle section so that it becomes the new right section. Make sure that your hair is pulled tightly. 7. Add more hair to the left section, then cross it over the middle section. Adjust your hair, pulling it tightly.	This is the pattern that you will use to finish your braid.

Pick a reference or photograph. Make sure whichever picture(s) you choose, drawing them matches your skill level. If you're just a beginner, you probably shouldn't pick a photo that involves too many weird shadows, is taken from an unusual angle, etc.; keep it simply. If you've had more practice drawing portraits, you can try something more complex to challenge your skills. * Decide if you want the person to be male or female. Male portraits tend to have stronger shadows, which may or may not be easier for you. Female portraits tend to have longer hair, and some people find a lot of hair boring and/or difficult to draw. * Decide if you want the person to be younger or older. Older faces can be more interesting, yet more challenging, because of the extra lines and texture, but they can also convey the most emotion. Very little children are easier to draw, but may be harder if you're used to drawing adults. 2. To begin, create a general outline of the face and head. For this, use a lighter pencil, since a 2H, or if you don't have pencils with different lead, use a mechanical pencil. These pencils create thinner, lighter lines, which will be easier to erase if you need to change the outline. * Go in further and draw the outlines of the general facial features, such as the eyes, some lines of the nose, inside of the ear, and lips, but don't shadow anything in. 3. DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING. Only draw what you can see. If there are no bags under the eyes, do not draw them. If you can only see two or three lines around the nose, don't draw more to make it more defined. Making assumptions is risky because those assumptions could be false and mess up the image being conveyed. * You can go back later and add details that can't be seen in your reference photo, if you don't want your portrait to be an exact replica. 4. Begin shadowing. This is the most daunting part of drawing a portrait, but it's what makes a the subject come to life. * Determine the lightest and darkest parts on the person's face. If you want your portrait to look 3-dimensional and dramatic, make the lightest parts as white as possible (with your hardest/finest pencil) and make the darkest parts and black as possible (with your boldest pencil). 5. Use keen observational skills. To make sure the shadows and features look realistic and similar to your reference, consistently look back and compare your drawing to the photo. You don't have to become OCD about this--especially if you're a beginner, your drawing will almost never look like an exact copy of the photo. * Don't forget that part of drawing a good portrait is capturing the uniqueness and expression of your subject.	Or if their eyebrows are more whispy, don't try to darken them. A portrait should look like a real person, not an ideal.

Act sick the day before, Jog your memory. You've been sick before, and people have noticed. What did you feel like? More importantly, what did people notice the most when you were sick? What were you sick with at that time? It'll be much easier to convince people that you have that illness again rather than tackling a whole new ailment. 2. If you have green concealer, rub it on your cheeks and forehead to make you appear pale. don't paint your face green, just slightly change the color of your skin. 3. Fake a fever. If someone is going to take your temperature for evidence, then you'll need to know how to raise your temperature. Otherwise, making your face look flushed and feel hot will do the trick. This can be accomplished by rubbing your face vigorously with your hands, laying a heating pad over your face for a few minutes, or laying down on your back with you head hanging off the edge of your bed so that all the blood flows to it. Or, you could drink hot water before and then let them take it. (be careful though, sometimes water reaches well past 103.8 and your parents will make you go to the doctor who will tell them that nothing is wrong with you. Another way to fake your temperature is to put the thermometer on a lightbulb for less than a second. You can always try again. Obviously, you cant do this if your parents take your temperature, or they stay in the room.	.

Lower your voice. When you’re not confident and a bit nervous, your voice tends to stay in its higher register. It’s not always easy to detect, too, when it’s happening. So consciously keep your voice a bit lower, whether you notice it or not. If you know you feel uncomfortable, keep a look out for how your voice changes. * Lower the pitch of your voice, in addition to the volume if that’s an issue for you. In other words, speak up! This will tell others that you view your voice as worthy of being heard. And then they’ll be more likely to follow suit, thinking the same. 2. Speak more slowly. Much like how our voices raise when we’re nervous, they tend to speed up, too. So the next time you’re in front of class giving a presentation, slow down. Slow way down. Slow down to the point where you think you’re going too slow &ndash; odds are then you’re doing it just right. * An unconfident person wants the moment to pass as quickly as possible and get over it &ndash; hence why they speed up in the first place. To fake confidence, slow down, giving off the impression that you're comfortable basking in the spotlight. 3. Use ""I"" statements. Confident people are more likely to be assertive and use ""I"" statements. Instead of ""You make me angry,"" which is quite passive, a confident person might say, ""I am angry with you,"" which is much more direct and cutting. To feign confidence, talk about yourself. No one else is going to! * It's nice to ask questions about those around you, definitely. Everyone appreciates a good listener. But you've got to be an active part of the conversation, too, by speaking. If something comes up that you can relate to, talk about your experiences with it. The person you're talking to just saw your favorite movie? Instead of, ""Oh, what a great movie!"" you might say, ""I love that movie! It's my favorite. I just saw it for the umpteenth time last..."" 4. Speak positively and avoid gossip. We all know that person who is constantly being negative, nagging, and spreading gossip about their group of friends and enemies. It’s pretty easy to guess that that person doesn’t like themselves, so don’t be that person! In order to appear confident, you’ve gotta convince the world that you’re feeling good."	.

Draw three smaller circles inside the eye shapes and shade them in completely, leaving the smaller circles unshaded. 8. Draw the eyebrows. Do this by sketching two small, curved lines aligning the tops of the eyes. The eyebrows should not extend further than the eyes. 9. Draw the nostrils. You can simply do this by making two really small oval-shaped dots at the center of the bottom of the nose. 10. Draw the ears.

Firstly, set out a pair of jump wings in the middle of an otherwise empty arena. Put them very wide apart. Now lead your horse into the arena. Your horse should be wearing only a headcollar and lead rope. Ignore the wings and lead your horse around the outside edge of the arena. Your horse may try to turn his head and look at the wings. This is allowed; do not force your horse to look away from them. 2. Secondly, turn in off the track and halt so you are looking at the wings. Allow your horse to stretch his neck out and look for a few moments at the wings. The horse's ears may well be back if he is frightened. Do not do anything, just look at the wings until Step 3. 3. Loosen the lead rope in your hands so there is some slack. Now take two slow steps forward towards the wings and let your horse follow. Do not hurry him. After every two steps, halt and let him take another long look at the wings. At this point, your horse should be needing less and less time to look before walking on. 4. Next, take as many long, slow steps towards the wings as needed to get close to one of them. Stand motionlessly beside one wing. Let your horse look at it for a few moments. If he wants to, let him sniff it. Now turn him away from you and walk around it in a small circle, at whatever speed he is comfortable with. Repeat this with the other wing. 5. Now let him loose in the arena - take off his headcollar. Shoo him away from you and put your treat down between the wings. Stand close to the wings and be still and silent. Relax; this will create a calmer, more relaxed atmosphere for the horse. Wait for him to come to you; do not go to him. Eventually, he should come to the wings in order to get the treat. When he walks between the wings, make sure he eats the treats and gets rewarded. 6.	Lead him down the centreline from C to A and through the wings. He should have no problem with this now. When he comes out from between the wings, reward him with a pat and a cuddle and a treat if you have some more. This method can be repeated if necessary.
Design_a_Map_for_Call_of_Duties_Zombies.txt	Begin_Revision	0.846	## Steps	75	Finally draw up your final plan .	## Steps	103	Draw up your final plan .	<delete><Finally><1>|||<replace><draw><2><Draw><1>	True	Steps  1. Choose a Theme. The first and hardest part of map design is the theme. It is what makes your map, your map. To decide on an idea, first look at the themes in other maps. They are usually war related. Next you should look for something that fits with zombies, but doesn't already exist. A few ideas I can suggest are: * Tribal Island * War Struck Town * Labour/Concentration Camp * Mansion 2. Flesh out Ideas. You want to make sure you know exactly how your map will work before you start designing it. Use mind maps and try to think about the following: * Perks on the map * Weapons on the map * Wonder Weapon? * Easter Egg Ending? 3. Start Drawing. It is a good idea to start by drawing a top-down layout of your map. This doesn't have to be the final product, it is just to give you somewhere to start. You should try to include as much detail on this plan as you can. Things like perk locations, doors and box spawns will all help you when drawing your final plan. 4. Check the fairness. You now need to check whether your map is going to be fair for the player. If your map has a Pack-a-Punch, make sure all routes there cost the same amount of points. You should also think about the prices of doors. If a door only leads into one room with not much in it, it isn't fair to charge 1500 points, think half that. Furthermore, doors out of spawn should only cost 750, and then up in the following order: 1000, 1250, 1500, 2000. It is also a good idea to think about zombie spawns if you haven't already. Don't make their locations unfair. 5. Balance it out. Now the map is fair for the player, you want to check it isn't too generous. Look for potential areas where they could camp or find immunity glitches. Also check that the zombie spawns aren't lacking in any areas, leading to camping. A good way to avoid camping is to include a spawning window at the end of a corridor or potential camping spot. 6.	Make this drawing as neat and detailed as you can. Use colours to define important things and even use a form key to help. Include everything your map will include, from easter eggs to zombie spawns. Take your time and don't rush it, it may spoil your finished product.

There are several principles to keep in mind. Dress in layers.Keep the wind, the cold air and moisture away from your body.Keep the heat close to your body. 2. Dress in layers so that if you are too hot, you can remove a layer and be comfortable. It's important not to get too hot, because you don't want to sweat and become wet. The moisture can in turn make you cold when it evaporates in the cold air. 3. Keep the heat close to your body. Beside your skin, use thin, thermal clothing to keep the heat in. I wear cotton ones, because they keep dry, unlike synthetics which keep the sweat close to your body. You should wear socks, long underwear, and an undershirt. For outerwear, you should wear a toque (knit hat), thin mittens or gloves, and a smaller, finer-weave scarf inside your coat, covering your chest and neck. 4. Over the socks, wear a second pair of socks, possibly a looser fitting, thicker sock, like a wool sock. Alpaca wool is 4 x as warm as sheep's wool. You may want to wear a third pair of socks if it is really cold out. Over the long underwear, wear jeans or thick canvas pants. Over the undershirt, wear a long-sleeved t-shirt, then a wool or fleece sweater, preferably with a hood, and maybe another sweater over that. Over the toque you can wear the hood of your sweater/sweatshirt. Over the mittens or gloves, wear leather mittens - NOT gloves - with sheepskin or other fur lining. Wool will work but only if it has a windproof shell layer on the outside.Over the fine-weave scarf, you will wear a warm coat, and then wear a generously sized knitted scarf on the outside, which is long enough to wrap around your neck and then your face twice each. 5. Over your socks, wear a thick water-proof winter boot, with good treads on the bottom, and a thick, furry or padded lining at the bottom of the sole and around in the sides of the boot. You can find ones with a temperature rating of -30 or -40C. Those are best. Over your pants, you can wear ski-pants, or if it is not that cold out, wind pants (unlined).Over the toque and sweater hood, you can wear the hood of your coat. A good hood is padded and lined, and has fur around the edges to keep the wind out. Use the drawstring to pull it close around your face and tie it. You'll be glad you did! 6. Your winter coat or parka is the most important pieces of clothing for your stay in the winter in Canada's prairie provinces. It should be padded and lined, have cuffs at the wrists and a tie at the waist. Down-filled is best, and it must be wind-proof, if you will be outside for more than a few minutes. It should have a padded hood, preferably with fur around the edges. The hood should have a drawstring so you can tie it around your neck. The coat's zipper should work well, and should be covered by a panel of cloth that stays shut, like with velcro or buttons. This keeps the cold wind from going into your zipper. Your coat should be long, if you are not wearing ski pants, so that it keeps the wind and cold off your lower body. Ask at the store what the temperature rating is, as some companies provide this for their coats. A rating of - 20C can be ok because you will wear a sweater underneath it. As you've noticed, you're going to wear a lot more clothing than usual, so your coat may need to be of a bigger size than you usually take! 7. That should do it! :) Be sure all your outer layers are windproof, waterproof, padded and warm, and you should be nice and warm for the winter.	Stay in your car if you get stranded out of town. Don't try to walk for help. Stay sheltered. Stay safe. Stay warm. And use the bathroom before you leave the house! :) Enjoy! :)

Know the basics of how to accentuate or hide certain areas of your body. The colors, cut and patterns you wear can draw people's eyes toward or away from portions of your figure. Here are some basics: * Dark colors hide, while light colors highlight. In general, put light colors where you want to draw the eye, and darker colors where you want to de-emphasize. * Example: To draw attention to you waist, wear a light colored belt over a darker shirt. * Example: To de-empasize your bottom half, wear dark pants and a brightly colored top. * Big patterns typically may make you look bigger, while small patterns can make you look smaller. * Example: Avoid the huge hibiscus flowers on your beach cover-up in favor of a smaller floral print. * Sometimes there are exceptions to this rule--try the outfit on if in doubt. A large print may indeed look nice in the overall outfit. A small busy print may not look as good as a tasteful larger one. * Exercise caution with horizontal stripes. Horizontal stripes tend to enlarge areas. * Stripes are generally okay on plus size clothing if they are diagonal or vertical. Good examples include pinstripes or an abstract print. * If you want to look larger in the bust area, horizontal stripes will enhance and draw attention to the bustline. * Again, the outfit needs to be put on in order to determine if an item looks good with horizontal lines. A well-balanced shirt with horizontal lines or colorblock can look attractive on a large frame. * Avoid ruffles on anything you want to look smaller; do put them on areas you want to emphasize. If you want to emphasize your bust, a ruffle can be attractive. However, it can over-empasize a woman who is large chested. Ruffles generally always look great on cuffs. * Wear ruched or gathered fabric on areas you want to make look smaller. For instance, you might see a one-piece swimsuit with ruched panels over the belly.	.

Let him nurse for the first four weeks. The milk the puppy's mother produces contains the exact combination of nutrients he needs to grow healthy and strong. It should make up his entire diet for the first four weeks after birth. If the puppy has trouble nursing, help him out by placing his mouth over the mother's nipple. * If you try to wean the puppy too early, his health will be compromised and he might be more prone to illnesses throughout life. * If the mother isn’t producing milk, find a commercial supplement. Don't introduce puppy food until four weeks have passed. 2. Introduce small quantities of puppy food at four weeks. The puppy will start eating when he or she is ready, and it's usually right around one month of age. Slowly introduce dry puppy food by placing it in a small bowl in front of the puppy. You can pour a little milk on it to soften it and help your puppy know it's food. * Make sure the food is designed for puppies. It should contain 25-40 percent protein. * Puppies need twice the energy intake of adults, so feeding them adult dog food isn't sufficient. Make sure it's food for puppies. * Treats are ok as long as they take up only 5 percent of the diet. The puppy needs mostly wholesome food in order to get strong. 3. Stick with the same brand your puppy is used to at first. If your puppy has been eating a certain brand of food before you take him or her home, you shouldn’t switch to a new brand right away. It might be hard for the puppy's system to get used to the taste and makeup of the new food. Introducing it gradually will keep your puppy from getting sick or turning his nose up at his dinner. * Let the puppy eat that same brand during the first few days he or she is in your home. Slowly start adding the new brand of food to the bowl and mixing it with the old brand. Then gradually switch it out entirely or the brand you want to use. * The transition process should take place over about seven days. 4. Know how much food to give your puppy breed. Different sized puppies have different needs and eating habits. Do some research to find out what portions are right for your breed. If you're not sure exactly how much to feed your puppy, talk to your vet. The amount you give the puppy is dependent on how many calories he needs to stay at a healthy weight and size. * The vet should help you figure out what this is, and how it should change over time. Don’t go by what’s on the back of the Purina bag. * Toy and miniature puppies will develop their own good eating habits, and won’t overeat. You can let them “free-feed,"" giving them as much as they want. Medium and large breeds will overeat if you give them too much food. You’ll need to provide proper serving sizes three times a day, then take the food away during other times. 5. Don’t feed puppies table scraps. It might be tempting to give your puppy enticing foods like bacon or ham from the table, but avoid doing this. Puppies need a very particular combination of nutrients to stay healthy, and they get what they need through their dry food. People food will hurt their stomachs, and could also lead to obesity and development problems. * As they get a little older, it's fine to feed them a very small amount of food that's easily digestible for dogs, like a dollop of peanut butter. *"	.

Find professional help. Completing the paper work alone for a patent can be daunting. Why not find someone who has successfully filled out and filed a similar patent in the past? There are several ways you can find professional help. You can hire a patent lawyer, ask for assistance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), check to see if your area offers free patent filing assistance, or visit a law school clinic. All of these sources should have thorough knowledge of patent law, helping to ensure that you complete the patent application successfully. * Talk to an attorney. Patent attorneys must have an undergraduate degree in a science or engineering field and need to pass the patent bar exam. Check the USPTO’s website in order to locate a patent attorney in your area. * Visit a law school with a patent clinic. At patent law clinics, you can ask questions relating to patent law and students gain real-life experience. This option is very good for those who cannot afford a bar approved patent lawyer, but still want legal advice. All of the advice given at these law clinic is vetted by a USPTO approved professor. 2. Find government sponsored patent assistance. In the United States and most other countries, the government will provide patent filing help as a way to promote upward mobility. * Consider the USPTO’s Pro Se Assistance program. Pro Se is an outreach program to inventors who want to file a patent on their inventions. They will help you get started and assemble all the necessary documents to file a patent form. Their services are free, but appointments must be made for their physical location in Alexandria, Virginia. * Some states offer specialized patent programs. These “self-help” programs are designed to assist people with low incomes. Assistance is done pro bono or for free for the public. An initial assessment of your eligibility will be done prior to receiving pro bono assistance. 3. Watch out for scams. There are many online sites that offer patent application assistance for an upfront fee. Often they’ll take your fee and leave you with nothing. In some of the worst cases, the company will actually steal your idea. Search online for reputable patent assistance, before choosing which firm to go with. * What signals a scam? Scam artists will do everything they can to get money upfront and to refuse putting anything definitive in writing. They'll ask for money via phone or email, but they won't want to sign official contracts until a later date. Make sure that you sign contracts upfront. It is best to have a lawyer look over these contracts in advance to make sure that you aren't signing over your ideas or promising money without a guarantee of services. 4. Determine what kind of application to file. Pick an application based on your innovation. You'll either choose a design, plant, or utility patent. * There is no ""international patent"", but you can apply for international patent protection. A separate patent application must be filed in each individual country. Filing a PCT application (Patent Cooperation Treaty) or an EU application (European Union) are some easier methods of applying to more than one country. International patent protection can protects you from companies that want to sell similar products in the United States."	This will help protect your product in some cases, but if you want to protect your rights on a global scale, you'll have to apply for patents in every country.

Pants. First you need to buy some dark colored jeans. They can be skinny or baggy it does not matter. If you're going with the skinny jeans, find some that fit fine but aren't extremely tight. That way if you have to change at school it won't take too long. It doesn't matter if you decide to get ""girl"" jeans, clothes don't have genders and neither does being emo. 2. Find some studded belts and rubber bracelets, preferably band or anime bracelets. 3. Shirts. Shirts can be any dark color such as black, red, blue, and even forest green. Any graphic designs, novelty tees and band shirts are also emo. If you can't find some good shirts for the emo look, go to a store in your area and look for some shirts that look emo. Some good emo bands for shirts are Fall Out Boy, Linkin Park, Metallica, My Chemical Romance, Panic!, At The Disco, Twenty One Pilots, Pierce The Veil, All Time Low, Black Veil Brides, Paramore, Green Day, Blink-182, Muse etc. Hot Topic is a great place to go to for any of your fashion needs and desires. 4. Hair. Hair is an important part of the emo look, because one of the most stereotypical things about emo kids is that they have a fringe. If you want, dye your hair darker/lighter or even get unnatural colors. If your parents won't let you put unnatural color in your hair, go to Sally's or someplace that sells extensions and put them in or you can go to the beauty shop and get some colored hair spray. This goes for guys as well, the emo subculture isn't gender role conforming and anyone can wear basically all emo clothes/makeup/accessories/hair etc. If you can't find colored extensions, buy normal ones and dye them. 5. Jackets. Any jacket that's a dark color will work especially leather jackets with or without studs. Ones with band patches are also a great choice. You can buy these or even make your own. 6. Shoes. Shoes recommended are Converse, Vans, Circa or any skate shoes.(Converse aren't skate shoes, though Vans and Circa are.) 7. Bag/Backpack. Of course, you're dressing for school so you're gonna need a backpack. A simple messenger bag with pins and patches on it will do. Alternatively, you can take a normal backpack with Skulls, checkers or neon colors."	.

Avoid heavily processed foods. Many heavily processed foods will contain additives. Minimize or avoid these foods to help you reduce the amount of additives you consume throughout the day. * Top contenders for highly processed foods include: frozen meals, canned meals, deli meat, breakfast meats and processed meats, condiments, sauces and dressing, sweetened beverages, fast foods and chips/crackers. * Foods that spoil quickly or that are minimally packaged are unlikely to contain preservatives. Buy fresh, unprocessed produce and natural whole foods to reduce the time you spend reading ingredient lists. * If a food is processed and has preservatives, look for items that use more natural preservatives like salt, vinegar, sugar, citric acid or ascorbic acid. 2. Cook from home and make items from scratch. If you want to get rid of additives in your diet, you'll most likely have to start making some foods from scratch or homemade. * Making items yourself allows you to control what goes into your foods and meals. You can control the calories, sugar, fat, salt and the amount of additives your foods contain. * If you're coming from a diet that contains large quantities of processed foods or those that contain a lot of additives, slowly start switching over to more homemade foods. Make changes very quickly is generally not easy or sustainable long-term. * Some examples of items you can make yourself include: salad dressings, sauces or marinades, bread, your own frozen vegetables or fruit, or your own ""freezer meals"" made with homemade items. 3. Make a note of preservative-free products you enjoy. After you have identified foods that are free of chemical preservatives, add them to a “cheat sheet” list to take shopping. * This will spare you the trouble of re-reading the ingredient list on future grocery trips. * In addition, you can provide this list to family, friends or co-workers who may also be purchasing foods for you. They'll know exactly what to get. 4. Avoid processed items when you go out to eat. If you choose to go out to eat, you may encounter some highly processed foods or those foods that contain a lot of preservatives. Be choosy about where you go out to eat to avoid this problem. * Many restaurant are now advertising they use foods free of preservatives, all organic ingredients or meats without added hormones. Review the restaurant's website to verify if they truly use these types of ingredients. *"	Talk to a manager or a cook to find out what types of foods they are using to prepare their meals.

Some TV channels, such as some weather and news channels will list the time to the second. There are also websites that list time accurately, some in UTC and others in local time. * An Iridium flare looks like a star that moves slowly and quickly brightens, then slowly fades away. If it looks elongated, leaves a visible trail, fades away in less than a second from becoming visible, or lasts more than a minute, it is most likely either a meteor, a fireball, or the ISS (International Space Station, which can also be found with Heavens-Above). * Dress for the weather. You'll probably only be outside for only a few minutes unless you're also going stargazing. If dressing up will take a few minutes, then go outside even earlier or bring an accurately-timed watch. * You can also photograph a video of an iridium flare, but make sure it is pointed in exactly the right direction, zoomed in, and you are moving the camera at the right speed. You might also have to adjust the camera settings. * Some flares can occasionally appear in daytime and become bright enough to be visible. Just use the Daytime Iridium Flares link. * Re-check Heavens-above shortly before observing. Flares that are forecast days or weeks in advance might not be accurate, so they might be brighter or dimmer than expected, they might come earlier or later, or they might be in a slightly different point of sky, or sometimes they might not appear at all.	You might use this to try to photograph the satellite through a telescope, but remember this is very difficult. The ISS is actually easier to photograph.

Make sure you have iTunes installed on your computer. If you do not, you can download it here: http://apple.co/25R5tLt (Windows or Mac; iTunes is already pre-installed on a Mac, but just in case you can download it again) 2. Plug in your iPod touch to your computer with iTunes on it, using the USB to Lightning cable (or USB to 30-pin cable if you have an older iPod touch) 3. Open iTunes, then click on the iPod touch icon in the toolbar towards the top of the screen with some other icons to access your iPod touch settings 4. Click on ""Summary"" in the column on the left side of the screen, then look towards the ""Backups"" box, and click ""Back Up Now"". Just wait a few minutes for the backup to complete. When it is finished, make sure you fully quit iTunes, and keep your device plugged in to your computer.You will have to backup your iPod touch to iTunes because you will have to restore your iPod touch later in the process, and it will restore from the backup you just made with all of your data. 5. You will have to download a free program named ""iBackupbot"". You can download it here: http://www.icopybot.com/ibackupbot_setup.exe (Windows) or http://www.icopybot.com/iBackupBot-Setup.dmg (Mac) 6. Once you are finished installing iBackupbot, open it. 7. Once it opens, you will see your iPod touch in the device list on the left. Click on the little triangle next to it. You will see a drop-down menu. Click on ""System files"". 8. In the toolbar on the top, you will see a search bar. Type this EXACT thing into the search bar: com.apple.sp 9. Now search it up, and you will see something named ""com.apple.springboard.plist"". There may be multiple ones named that, but always go with the one that is a larger file size. Click on the one with the larger file size. You may be prompted with a message to buy the full version of iBackupbot, since you are using a trial version. You don't need to buy the full version, so you can just click ""Cancel"", and you will proceed to the next step. 10. You will see some coding. Make sure at the top of the window you are in ""XML View"". You will have to copy a code and then paste it in there. You can find the code here: http://freetexthost.com/q2knosjiqc 11. Copy the exact code. Now, you will have to paste the code into iBackupbot. To do this, put your cursor on the 4th line after the "">"" in """", and press ""Enter"" on your keyboard. This will create a new line. Now, paste the code there, and it will make 3 new lines, plus the one you just created by pressing ""Enter"". 12. Now this is a vital step in this process so pay close attention. Line up your 4 lines of coding you just pasted with the coding underneath the code you pasted. If you would like to see what exactly you have to do, you can see a picture here: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=30j17r7&s=9.Vwkim4R0P-1 13.

Drain_a_Hot_Tub_Easily_Using_a_Drain_Garden_Hose.txt	Begin_Revision	0.751	## Steps	86	Then , disconnect the hose from the faucet .	## Steps	113	Disconnect the hose from the faucet .	<delete><Then><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><disconnect><3><Disconnect><1>	True	Steps  1. Collect equipment needed:1) Garden hose...any one will do, but about 20 feet long would be the minimum. 2) Safe place for the water to drain. Reuse the water (if possible) for watering plants, etc. 2. What we're going to do is create a basic siphon, and let gravity do the work for us, OK? The easiest way to get this rolling is to connect your hose to the water bib (that's a faucet on the side of your house), put the open end into the hot tub, and start filling the hot tub. The idea here is to fill the hose with water completely, with minimal air bubbles in the line. Once you've got flow into the tub, turn off the water at the hose bibb. Keep the hose end in the hot tub submerged, or you'll have to refill the hose with water! Bend a kink into the hose a couple feet below the connection to the hose bibb. This seals the water inside the hose, more or less.	"You'll have to hold the kink in the hose until you get the tail end (the end you're holding) BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE HOT TUB. (Here's where gravity comes into play). Once you've got the end you're holding (still kinked) below the level of the hot tub, and you're in your pre-selected location for where you want the water to go, let the end of the hose un-kink, and the water will start flowing. You've just created a siphon! Water ""seeks it's own level"", which is how this system works. The water pressure in the hot tub essentially pushes the water out the hose, because the open end of the hose is lower than the level of the water in the hot tub. Yes, the water has to go up and over the edge of the tub, but here's the neat part - because the hose was full of water, the water inside the hose creates suction at the end inside the tub, which pulls the water over the edge, and flows down the line."

Using contemporary examples will help your child see how racism affects people's reasoning in real time. As your child gets older, you can build upon the same things you’ve already been teaching them. When they ask about a certain issue, try to focus on the current event. If you start with a lengthy history lesson on race, they might lose focus by the time you get to the issue they're curious about. They’ll have more sophisticated questions, which will require more thorough answers. Talk about current events so that they have real life examples. * For instance, maybe your tween asks you why some NFL players are kneeling during the national anthem. You can explain that it is a protest against injustice towards African Americans. * Talk about specific instances of police brutality to help them understand what people are protesting. * You can follow up on the talk by placing current events in historical context. Help your child to research historical events that they hear about or that are related to current events. Use reliable sources and help your child to learn about the event from multiple perspectives. 2. Use multimedia. Encourage tweens and teens to engage with multimedia. Allow them to watch videos created by other teens that address racism. Monitor their use of social media, but allow them to follow people who post about combating racism. Each week, you can ask them if they saw anything interesting about race or racism. Take the time to ask if they have any questions or if they learned anything new. 3. Don’t avoid the subject. Your child may not ask you questions. That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be having conversations about race. It just means that it is your job to bring it up. Approach the issue head on instead of avoiding it. * You could say, “That was a disturbing story on the news this evening. It seems like people aren't being fair to the Native Americans. What did you think?” 4. Ask your kids questions about race. Find natural ways to bring up the subject of race and racism.	.

Gather some small change and try on everything. When testing, keep your look for at least three days. If more than five people follow you in one day, then you've hit jackpot. * If you can't afford to play big, then play smart. Start with 50% of your money and then add to it. Playing it too save can waste time and time can get you way more GPs. If everything goes well, go for 60%, if not, go for 45% of your profits. * To get to know people takes time, but it is worth it. You should do personal exams rather than having people squeeze strangers into your life. If you want people to come back to you, tip them about 30% of their pay before they do their jobs. If they're smart, they'll obey and come back for more. It's always good to tip generously for the people that you need to trust. * If nobody wants to do business with you, you've gotta create an illusion. Start your interactions with cheap stuff. slowly put on more expensive items with adding a little bit everyday, just a litte below average price. Then when you get popular, it is your chance to make bigger money. Put the price a inch above average and move it slightly everyday in both directions. You want to make sure that you cover the money you've lost and get even more.	When business isn't so hot, repeat the process again.

Determine if the headache is primary or secondary. Doctors classify headaches into two basic types, primary and secondary. Chronic primary headaches are those that are recurrent but have no organic disease underlying them. Chronic secondary headaches, on the other hand, are caused by a medical condition. 2. Either primary or secondary headaches could be chronic, though chronic headaches tend to be classified as primary. * Primary headaches might be caused by exposure to very cold temperatures, sexual intercourse, or coughing excessively. The main types of primary headaches are tension headaches, migraines, and cluster headaches. A fourth, rarer type, is the icepick headache, a variation in which you feel as though you’re being stabbed in the head with an icepick. * Conditions that might lead to secondary headaches include concussions, whiplash (or other injury to the neck, head, or back), stroke, seizures, AIDS, meningitis, high blood pressure, dehydration, or allergies. These conditions require a doctor’s diagnosis and medical treatment. * If you have a chronic secondary headache, your situation is more serious. The condition underlying your chronic headaches could be life threatening, so you should see a doctor as soon as possible. 3. Evaluate the length of the headache. The three main types of chronic headaches all last for different lengths of time. One way to evaluate the severity of the chronic headache is to identify how long it lasts. * Tension headaches tend to last less than 30 minutes. They occur as a response to stress or difficulty at school, work, or another social situation. They are the most common type of chronic headache. * Cluster headaches are a bit more severe. They typically last 30 to 60 minutes and occur regularly (in “clusters”) over a period of days, weeks, or months, then disappear. * Migraines are the most intense and severe headaches. They usually last between four and 24 hours, but they can occur continuously for up to three days. 4. Consider the side effects. Each of the three major types of chronic headaches also have side effects apart from pain that differ in severity. The severity of the side effects basically maps onto the length of maximum time each type of headache typically lasts. Use the extremity and the number of side effects most commonly associated with the three major types of chronic headaches to better evaluate their potential severity. *	The only symptom is pain in and around the head, neck, and shoulders.

Understand that antihistamines are usually not helpful. In cases of unexplained swelling, many doctors will recommend an antihistamine. Unfortunately, in the case of hereditary angiodema, antihistamines do not help treat the symptoms. If you have unexplained swelling that doesn’t react to antihistamines, this could be a clue that you have hereditary angiodema. * In cases of emergency, epinephrine can be used to treat someone with hereditary angiodema. For example, if they are unable to breathe due to a swollen airway. 2. Consider the treatment options. As of 2016, there are five treatments for hereditary angiodema that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Some of these treatments are given intravenously (e.g. through an IV) while others are given as an injection. Most people who have hereditary angiodema are able to administer these treatments themselves, in the comfort of their home. * The treatment option that will be best for you is dependent upon your specific case. If you have a non-functioning C1-inhibitor, for example, your doctor might prescribe you Cinryze, Berinert, or Ruconest, which all work to help your C1-inhibitor function.	.

You will be able to see the tiny insects on your paper towel after each wipe. * use only Cool- Warm water (NEVER HOT) 4. Let make a homemade pesticide. Now take your ingredients and mix them all together equally. All you will need is one ounce of your mixture per gallon of water! This is very important because you can cause severe harm to you plants.Hint: The best way to distribute your mixture is with an atomized sprayer (see above) 5. Now its finally time to get to killing those annoying little things all over your plants! go ahead and soak your leaves especially the under sides where the Spider mites tend to live.	Once you are at the point of spraying your plants, it would be recommended to cool down your grow space quite a bit. Just over 60 Degrees will do just fine, the colder temp forces the Spider Mites to slow their reproduction and movements making it easier to get them under controll. (See Above) The best time to spray:

Make sure your reason for getting out of going to an event has evidence behind it. Just because someone may say ""Oh, I went to that and I slept through it"" doesn't mean it's true. If you get out of an event that turned out to be fun and exciting, you'll be very upset you missed it. 2. Reason with whoever is asking you to go. It could be your parents, a teacher, a boss, etc. Always ask if it is a mandatory event before going to drastic measures. 3. There are several ways about going about something like this.The first, and most obvious, is to fake a sickness. �If you pull it off it is a sure-fire way to not go or leave early. Although, there are still many flaws and sources for error. To fake a sickness read steps 4 through 6. To learn how to reason your way out read step 7. 4. two days before the event complain about a stomach ache or head ache. If you are faking a stomach ache don't try to hold your stomach and double over. This will make you look fake. Just every once in a while rub your stomach or groan. For head aches, close your eyes and rub one of you temples sloppily with your hand. It is impotant NEVER to fake a sore throat. Doing so may lead to the docter's office or worse- your parents will look in your mouth and see it looks normal, foiling your plan. 5. The next day (the day before the event), fake a fever. This can be done in several ways. First run a washcloth under really hot water. Ring it out and let it sit for about a minute so that it's damp woth hot water. Cover your whole face with it for approx. 3 minutes. It helps id your face is red so you may want to rub it a little. 6."	Get it to a temperature between 100 and 102 degree. Any higher will get a call to your doctor a trip to the emergency room. If your thermometer is lower than 100 degrees than it would be too close to average body temperature and once again your plan would be foiled. getting your thermometer to this level can be done by holdong it to a lightbulb that has been on for a few minutes. Hold against the lightbulb one second at a time until desired temperature. Make sure to move slowly and seem dazed.

Get_Rid_of_Dandruff.txt	Begin_Revision	0.936	### Anti-Dandruff Shampoos	3244	Also make sure to keep the shampoo in your hair for as long as directed .	## Tips	3389	Make sure to keep the shampoo in your hair for as long as directed .	<delete><Also><1>|||<replace><make><2><Make><1>	True	Anti-Dandruff Shampoos  1. Try a zinc pyrithione shampoo. Zinc pyrithione is an antibacterial and antifungal agent, so it works well against dandruff caused by a fungus. * Zinc pyrithione is often used to treat dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. * Common zinc pyrithione shampoos include Head & Shoulders, Selsun Salon, and Neutrogena Daily Control Dandruff Shampoo. 2. Use a shampoo with a coal tar base. Coal tar slows down the rate of decay the skin cells of your scalp undergo. Skin cells that die off more slowly are less likely to cause flaking. * Coal tar is a by-product the coal manufacturing process, and it is often used to treat dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis. * Common shampoos containing coal tar include Neutrogena T/Gel, Denorex Therapeutic Protection, and Scytera. 3. Look into selenium sulfide shampoos. Selenium sulfide is a compound that slows down the rate at which skin cells on your scalp die, thereby reducing flaking. The compound is also thought to combat the effects of a genus of fungi known as malassezia. * Note that selenium sulfide can discolor blond, gray, or chemically colored hair. In order to reduce the potential discoloration, only use the shampoos as often as instructed and rinse thoroughly with water. * Shampoos using selenium sulfide include Selsun Blue, Dandrex, and Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength. 4. Consider a shampoo with salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is a compound capable of eliminating dandruff-related scale. * The downfall of dandruff shampoos containing salicylic acid is that they tend to make a person's scalp more dry. This can actually lead to more flaking and more dandruff. To minimize this effect, use a conditioner after shampooing. * Common shampoos containing salicylic acid acid include Ionil T and Neutrogena T/Sal. * Note that some salicylic acid shampoos also contain sulfur. Common brands include Sebex and Sebulex. 5. Check out a shampoo containing ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that works well against many types of fungi. * These shampoos are usually used when other dandruff shampoos fail. * While over-the-counter shampoos can contain ketoconazole, this agent is also commonly found in prescription shampoos. * Common types of ketoconazole shampoos include Nizoral, Extina, and Xolegel. 6. Always follow the instructions. Most dandruff shampoos can be used every one to two days, but stronger shampoos may have more specific instructions. Using the shampoos as directed will ensure that they work properly without damaging your hair or scalp. *	Most shampoos state that you should keep the shampoo on for at least five minutes before rinsing, but again, these instructions can vary by brand.

Legs, and armpits are a must if you are allowed to shave yet. If you're not, then you shouldn't try to shave, just go without it. 4. Wash your face! Use face masks, creams and scrubs. Just be sure not to use too many, though, because you may break out. You definitely don't want this to happen! 5. Brush your teeth and use mouth wash. Try to use a lighter brand of mouthwash, because your date/dance partner doesn't want to smell nothing but mouthwash and alcohol. Also, some people use the full amount of heavy mouthwash to clean their teeth, then brush their teeth. 6. Do your makeup! Eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, blush, cover-up, foundation, lip gloss, etc. Just don't wear too much, because no one wants to dance with a clown. They want to dance with the real you. (See Tips) 7. Lotion. You'll be near the guys, probably dancing with them too! They'll need to feel how soft your hands, arm and possibly even face are.

Try finding out one's preference for: food, drinks, music, movies... This will help you to select bars or restaurants to go to later. Another thing is, let the person talk and talk. Though difficult, but once you start up a conversation on any topic remember that you must be a good listener because people always like to talk about their problems, routine, job and etc... After long talks, you can somehow have a pretty good idea about this person's background. Moreover, what is the point of your dating? do you just want to get laid? or you wish to make a solid relationship out of it? If you pick the former, make sure your date wants the same thing cause otherwise you might be in serious trouble. lol. However, if you go for the latter just bear in mind that time is the best friend to grow tides in a relationship. see ya!

Gather materials. Cannulation requires some basic preparation and precaution. You will need to protect yourself from contact with a patient's body fluids and you need to protect the patient from injury or infection. In order to do this you will need: * Sterile disposable gloves * Tourniquet * Sterile bandage or dressing * Gauze * Alcohol wipes * Medical tape * Sharps container * Sterile surface to set tools on * Additional supplies for your specific procedure 2. Choose the size of the cannula you will use. In general, the larger gauge needle you use, the higher the maximum flow rate of the fluid entering into the vein. Larger sized needles actually have a smaller number, so a 14 gauge is large, while a 22 gauge is small. Choose a size that can easily fulfill the purpose of the procedure but is not oversized. * The smallest needles are used in children. The largest are used for rapid blood transfusion. 3. Have a discussion with your patient. Get informed consent from the patient before you begin the procedure. This is usually done verbally. This builds up a rapport with the patient and allows for a less traumatic experience. * Also take a quick history, primarily to exclude any allergy or sensitivity that the patient may have. This is particularly true for latex allergy. Should an allergy to latex be confirmed, then the tourniquet, gloves, and the cannula must be latex-free. 4. Wash your hands and put on gloves. All medical professionals should follow thorough and proper hygiene practices before coming into contact with a patient.	.

Make your visitors involved. One of the things that you can't forget is that your visitors like to be involved with your website. The more involved they are, the more likely they come back one time after the other. There are a few ways to make this happen: * Surveys: Surveys are a great way to give a voice to your visitors. In addition, you will get priceless information about what they like and want to see on your website. * Contests: There are many different contests that you can run on your website to make sure that your visitors come back. Just run a contest to see who is able to create the best short blurb about your product, for example. As for the prize, you can offer some merchandise or even a discount on one of your products and services. More than just simply getting your visitors involved, you will probably get a lot of great testimonials to display on your website. * Online Suggestion Box: Although it's not very common to see suggestion boxes on websites, the truth is that they can work out really well. You will be giving your visitors the chance for them to ask what they want to see on your website, and you'll get a great feedback that can help you improve your overall website. 2. Realize that your content is valuable. Content matters and is one of the best ways that you have to get not only returning visitors as well as new visitors. However, when you decide to implement a content marketing strategy on your website, you need to make sure that you can post high-quality blog posts on a regular basis. In addition, you need to make sure that you are answering your visitor's questions. This is why they come to your blog after all - to get the answers they need. * In what concerns with the type of content that you can write, you may have some blog posts with evergreen content, others mentioning your products and services and how they can help your visitors, among so many others. * In case you don't like to write, you'll be glad to know that you can hire a ghostwriter for your blog posts. This way, you can easily schedule the posts, publish them, and take the time to promote them. 3. Make your website memorable. When you want to increase your returning visitors, one of the problems that you have is that there are just too many websites and too many blogs online. So, why should your visitors decide to come back and not simply visiting one of your competitors? * The answer is to ensure that you have a memorable website. In order to do it, make sure that business logo and name are visible. You should definitely see a lot of images instead of big chunks of text. 4. Keep your website attractive. More than posting regular content on your website, you need to make it attractive. So, you should pay special attention to change the featured posts, the sticky ones, and you can even rotate your products and make one of them featured for a specific amount of time. * In case you are dealing with stocks, make sure that your inventory is always up to date. After all, there is nothing more frustrating for a customer than ordering a product just to discover that you run out of stock the day or week before. These are the kinds of mistakes that customers don't tend to forgive. * Another thing that you also need to make sure that is working are links. You just have no idea about how many websites have broken links. * It's always a good idea to check your website on different computers, mobile devices, as well as using different browsers. Check if every image and text appears in the right place. * The loading time is another aspect to consider. If your website is taking more than 10 seconds to load completely, you can be sure that you are losing a lot of visitors. So, optimize the images, take advantage of cache plugins, among other things that can help your website load faster. * You need to make sure that your website is user-friendly. If you are noticing a high bounce rate, this may mean that your visitors just don't like your organization and layout. Try to change a few things and keep checking the bounce rate. 5. Keep your visitors informed. A website is not static. It just keeps changing. Either the copy, the images, or simply the addition of a new product or service. If you are planning on launching a new product or service (or you just did), make sure that your visitors are aware of it. Make it stand out or they won't even notice it. Most websites tend to opt for the ""NEW"" label, but you can adopt any other as long as your visitors notice it. * Another way that you have to let your visitors know about an important change or addition on your website is to have an email list specifically for this purpose. So, whenever there is something new about your website, you can simply email them. 6. Connect with your visitors. While you have your website, you probably already have social media pages for your company. So, why not taking advantage of these ones to also connect with your visitors? * You can add some of your content here, and you can even have some exclusive contests or offers to attract them. 7. Create a forum or a chatroom. Most people like to express their own opinions. Others like to see some questions answered. So, why not taking these wants and needs and create your own forum or chatroom? After all, you'll be allowing your visitors to get in contact with each other and you will ultimately be creating a sense of community that will keep your visitors coming back to your website. 8. Keep looking, listening, and learning. The truth is that no matter how many visitors you already have or how many returning visitors you are getting, the more the better. So, it's important that you keep looking for ways to improve your website, to listen to your visitors and customers, to keep learning what is working and what's not, and why. *"	.

Learn what is low blood pressure. Low blood pressure in humans is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. There are several causes to low blood pressure as will be discussed in the context of this article. Low blood pressure can in general be caused due to two general causes. These are: Abnormal dilatation of blood vessels mostly by the effect of drugs and chemicals in the body. Another cause is low blood volume in the arteries and veins. 2. Know what causes low blood pressure. Abnormal dilatation of blood vessels can be caused due to inflammation in the body which inflammatory cells secrete to the blood circulation vasoactive compounds that can dilate the blood vessels. The most important compound in this class of vasoactive compounds is histamine. This compound is usually secreted by mast cells during an inflammatory process in the body. This causes in turn dilatation of the blood vessels with the result of lowering the blood pressure. 3. Know disorders that can trigger low blood pressure. An example of a disorder in the body that uses this mechanism of inflammation in order to induce hypotension is called anaphylaxis. This is an allergic reaction of the body that is triggered by a bee bite for example. This is a potentially serious condition which can be treated by the administration of the hormone epinephrine intravenously in order to correct the lowering of blood pressure by constricting the blood vessels which leads to elevation of the blood pressure. 4. The other general cause to low blood pressure is low blood volume in the arteries and veins. This can happen for example due to a hemorrhage in the body. With the loss of blood a state of hypovolemia can occur which subsequently can lead to low blood pressure. Also hypovolemia can be triggered by other causes. An example is vomitting and diarrhea. In this case dehydration can occur which can lead to low blood volume in the arteries. 5. Also known diseases in the body can cause a state of hypovolemia. An example is the disorder diabetes mellitus. One of the symptoms of this disorder is polyurea which can lead to depletion of body water. This can cause hypovolemia in certain patients of diabetes which do not drink enough water in order to compensate for the loss in water from the body. This in turn can cause lowering in blood pressure in affected individuals. 6. Also another pathologic condition in the body which can cause hypovolemia with subsequent development of low blood pressure is called diabetes insipidus. This syndrome is similar to diabetes mellitus as far as the development of polyurea is concerned. In this case also hypovolemia can develop due to the excessive loss of water in the urine by the effect of the decreased amount of the hormone vasopressin in the blood. This can predispose to hypotension. 7.	In this case the deficieny of the hormone aldosterone in the blood leads to wasting of sodium and water in the urine. This in turn causes hypovolemia with decreased blood pressure.

Try to make sure not to eat much meat wherever you are--it makes your farts real smelly and the poop gets acidic which makes it harder to hold it in. 3. When you feel the urge to let nature take its course, tighten glutes. Get in special position--whatever may work for you--so ideally the poop feeling goes away in 1-2 minutes. 4. Come up with distracting thoughts. Like a kitten loving and cuddling you.. Nothing funny or you may have a real accident in your pants. 5. Go somewhere private. If you happen to not be able to control it...get up in the middle of the night and let your business out where no one can smell it. You got to make sure there is toilet paper in there too or else it's going to be trouble. 6.	.

Give yourself time. Give yourself enough time to get ready so you're not running around last minute looking for your favourite earrings. Make sure you have a reasonable time to meet up and also arrange your travel too. Are you taking a taxi? Or the bus? Or maybe taking the car? Make sure you have all those things planned. 3. Shower/bathe. Take a bath or a shower, to relax you first. Use bath bombs, bubble bath and a refreshing shower gel. 4. Wash and condition your hair. Choose your favourite shampoo and conditioner and wash your hair. 5. Shave. If you are a teenager shaving may not apply to you. But if you do shave, then go ahead. Make sure you use lots of shaving gel or foam to help with little cuts and nicks. And use a good brand razor instead of a cheap one as they tend to break easier, they can cause cuts and nicks and they don't work as well at removing hair. 6. Treat your body. If you want, use a facial too. But when you get out of the bath/shower moisturize and if you need to use tanning lotion then go ahead. (This is optional) 7. Choose your outfit. You may have already done this step if so, just skip.	.

Keep working at doing your part to bless and help other people. * There is a lot to be said for just following the Ten Commandments, and loving your neighbor as best you are able. * It will be instant truth in you: to understand and recognize and acquire the joy, peace and the satisfaction in your better understanding to discern, come to know and recognize the nature of this as a True confession: count them 1st: God, 2nd: Jesus, 3rd: the Holy Spirit, and 4th: yourself all together are ""as one"" in unity and so are all believers also as one together with you, so you are with your fellows in that same fourth (4th) position of rest and peace in knowing the 3 in 1 are in you! * know - verb Inflected Form(s): knew, known; know·ing Etymology: Middle English, from Old English cnāwan; akin to Old High German bichnāan to recognize, Latin gnoscere, noscere to come to know, Greek gignōskein; a (2): to have understanding of  (3): to recognize the nature of or discern b (2): to be acquainted or familiar with (3): to have experience of a: to be aware of the truth or factuality of : be convinced or certain of b: to have a practical understanding of  * ""know""--not using this definition: a (1), and not b (1) so omit: a (1): to ""perceive directly"" : have direct cognition of No! it is by faith.b (1): to recognize as ""being the same"" as something previously known; No! you are ""a new creature"" in Christ Jesus! * If you accept your new status: ""then there you are."" * A simple fervent, effective prayer brings much of God's peace and help, and you can be blessed. Read examples of people who have been blessed. * Pray, because God will answer your prayers. Don't be afraid to tell your sins to God, he loves you. * Remember that God is ultimately the one who decides where you will go after you die, not you. You can live a good life, and do whatever it takes to go to Heaven, but God makes the final decision. * Love the Lord your God with all of your heart, mind, strength and soul and love your neighbor as yourself. Most important commandment of all. * Know that when you stand before God one day, it will not matter if someone here on a website assured you that you are, or are not going to heaven. What will matter is whether God told you that you are going to heaven or not (and be assured, dear reader, that God wants you to go to heaven even more than you want to!—Click here to see where it says that in the Bible) ---- So how can you know? God has given us the Bible as a trustworthy source of information (The more you sincerely study the Bible, the more you will find that it is trustworthy—see for yourself). The Bible tells us that God sent Jesus to die on the cross for our sins, and that we receive forgiveness through faith in Him. But don't just take my word for it, you can read it in the Bible yourself. * Also, dear reader; know that salvation is not just a bunch of hoops to jump through, or a bunch of steps to complete. It is a gift to receive, not a wage to earn (Romans 4:4-5). *"	"And if He has not answered your prayer yet, keep asking; God loves you and wants you to be saved. Jesus said, “So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened."" Luke 11:9-10"

Look into lip fillers. If temporary methods aren't cutting it for you, you might want to research lip fillers. Due to the popularity of the pouty look, there are dozens of options available. The most famous lip fillers are Botox, but there are other options that use different chemicals to keep the lips full. * During treatments, filler is injected into the lips, causing them to plump. The effect usually lasts for several months. * Be sure to conduct plenty of research and choose a technician who is well reviewed and very experienced. 2. Look into permanent makeup. If you're tired of lining your lips all the time, maybe permanent makeup is the right choice for you. It involves essentially tattooing the area around your lips to make them appear fuller or more colorful.	That will keep your lips beautiful forever.

Watch body language. Body language says a lot about a person, if he rarely ever looks at you, or isn't smiling (and has a vacant expression) while looking at you, odds are, he isn't into you. If he's interested, usually he will be looking at you a lot, and he will be willing to start small talk. 2. Pay attention to if he's ignoring you. If he ignores you during the day, and he shows hardly any interest, and looks at you once, then it's quite obvious he doesn't really see you interesting. 3. If he's talking to other girls, and not you, it's just quite obvious that he's probably interested in one of them. It also may be a possibility he's trying to make you jealous, if your not sure, look at him, and if he's talking to the girls and glancing at you, that could be one of the signs he likes you and is poking jealousy in your face, but if you're stalking him and staring at him with wide eyes and it's quite obvious, then don't be surprised if he does look at you. Try to be calm and collected. 4. The eye test - When he's looking at you, look at his eyes; if his pupils get larger, then he likes you. This has been proven that if a human really likes something, their pupils will enlarge. 5. The dropping test - Drop something, anything, a book, a pencil, possibly right in front of him, if he is willing to help you, there is a good chance he likes you, especially if he starts conversation with you right after. Guys usually always help out girls they like.	.

Tell the kids that the TV free-for-all is at an end. Explain to them that the level of TV viewing has reached a point of no return and that other activities in life are being neglected. Then tell them that the TV time is going to be regulated from now on. There will be whining, there will be arguing back and there will be the typical clever rationalizations that kids are famous for. Stick to your decision - TV time is being axed! 2. Develop a TV reduction plan. In consultation with your kids, sit down together and plot TV viewing time. Get a copy of the weekly TV schedule from your regular paper or magazine. Ask the kids which shows they like the most. Then tell them that those are going to be the only programs they can watch. Also consider allowing a time limit of 1 - 2 hours per day of viewing and no more. If there are more programs than hours alloted, the kids will be forced to choose. 3. Turn it off. Only permit the TV to be on when the program is being watched. Do not allow it to run as background noise. It will distract the kids and draw them back to it even if the program is not one that interested them initially. 4. Go cold turkey for the whole family. All for one and one for all. One drastic measure is to get rid of the TVs. Yes, it is drastic but if you have a family that is highly addicted to TV, it may be the only way to kickstart this plan. Give the TVs to a family member or friend to keep for a week to a month whilst the whole family goes cold turkey and relearns what they used to do before the TV was invented. One word of warning - do not turn to the internet, video games and other sources of electronic entertainment in place. Instead, bring out those old boardgames, cards and jigsaws to do together as a family. 5. Take TVs out of bedrooms. Just because a TV is affordable and keeps the kids out of your hair, does not mean that having TVs in bedrooms is acceptable. Bedrooms are for peace, rest and quiet play. TVs do not instill rest and peace, especially not kids' programs which are deliberately aimed at keeping kids interested through energizing them. Keep the TV in one central location only and somewhere that it is easy for you to monitor. If you have a larger family, you may need to consider an additional TV to avoid too many sharing clashes but in the main, sharing and compromise are two important skills to be teaching your kids. 6. Do not keep a TV/DVD/VCR in your vehicle. It's amazing how many parents rely on a DVD or VCR in their vehicle to keep the kids ""quiet"". Road trips or car errands are a great time for kids to draw, read books, play with Barbies or Transformers, talk with parents, listen to music, or just watch the surroundings out the window, etc. Kids don't need to be entertained all the time. 7. Provide alternatives. Kids are learning about their world everyday. Make sure that most of their learning comes from self-experience and not from being told about things via the medium of TV. To assist their self-exploration and to perk their curiosity, provide a range of alternative activities. Keep an activity cupboard packed with activities such as: * Science kit projects (exploding volcanoes, magnets, 3D models, electronics kits, weather forecasting kits, natural discovery books and kits etc.) * Craft, art and drawing materials. * Boardgames, cards, marbles, miniatures, Lego, building kits etc. * A good library of kids' books aimed at their ages, across a wide variety of subjects. 8. Encourage outdoor and sporting activities. Keep a good supply of balls, bats, rackets, shuttlecocks, jump ropes, Frisbees, bikes and other outdoor objects handy. Go to the parks, the pool, the football field and be active together. Encourage older kids to go by themselves and play sports with friends. Enroll kids of all ages in sports classes, either team or individual depending on your kids' expression of interest. 9. Go on outings together. Visit museums, parks, science centers, aquariums, zoos, amusement parks, mini-putting, the cinema, the beach\--anywhere that gets them away from the TV. Travel on the train to the end of the line just to see where it goes and come back again. Help out with volunteer projects. Do a variety of things that encourage the kids to explore their world and see, touch, taste, smell and hear it for themselves, senses that no TV program can ever truly stimulate or replicate. 10. Reward adherence to the TV reduction plan. Once the TV reduction plan has become routine and the kids are watching less TV and are only watching their allotted programs, back up their changed focus with rewards. The rewards might be activity based, such as going to an amusement park or the theater or they might be financial, such as new clothes, books or CDs. 11. Set a good example."	What you do will demonstrate to the kids what is okay to do. Watch less TV yourself, remove any TV from your bedroom, participate in the kids' activities and be active in sports, fitness and exercise. You will not only be setting your kids a great example but you'll be doing yourself a favor too. Just see how much more time emerges in your day when you restrict the TV viewing!

Make friends with your teammates , laugh , have a good time .	<delete><Finally><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><HAVE><3><Have><1>|||<replace><FUN><4><fun><2>	True	"Steps  1. Find a team to try out for, generally called a club because they include many teams of many different ages. I recommend trying out for at least 2 clubs, more if you are very serious about playing. Hundreds of girls try out per year (per club even) so the stakes are high. Find out their tryout information and sign up in advance if you can. There is always a tryout fee (anywhere from $5 to $20) and you will usually get a better deal if you sign up before. BEWARE: Many clubs in the same region (see tips) hold tryouts on the same day at conflicting times, forcing players to choose the club they want more. Make sure you know this. 2. Now that you have a club or clubs you are trying out for, go there and give it your all. Tryouts are long and tiring, but you must show stamina. The tournaments you will be playing in will be ALL DAY, usually with a minimum of 4 matches. If you can't last in a 4 hour tryout, they won't consider you. Every club is different, so I can't tell you what to expect, except that you will be given a random number. Remember your number with your life because this is how the coaches, whom you need to impress, will address you on this day. 3. Wait. It's different for each club, but most will give you a time limit to when they will contact you. If they contact you within that time limit, it means that they wanted you on their, first choice. They can still call you about up to 3 weeks after the cut off date, because some people will refuse and they will go to the waiting list. If you make it, you will either be on a National or Regional team (starting 2007 season). Ask your club director for more info pertaining to your region and club. Don't be discouraged if you don't get a call. My club's director says this at every tryout: One day isn't going to tell us (the coaches) how good you are as a volleyball player. We will make some mistakes and there is no way to get around it. But give it your all and we'll notice. 4. You've made it! Congradulations! (If you haven't made the team, this guide is of no more help, sorry.) Practice will usually begin in December or January. It is critical that you show up to each practice. Coaches will not give benching you a second thought if you don't show up on time or don't try your hardest. 5. Tourneys! Easily the most fun part of the season, tournaments are what you will play instead of one game per Saturday per week. It is very hard to explain how they group you into pools and brackets but it is similar to NCAA basketball. You will play the 3 other teams in your pool in the morning (which often lasts until 2 pm, ironically), have a ""lunch"" time, and then play in Gold, Silver, or Bronze bracket. 6. Don't be discouraged if your teammates aren't playing up to par. Sometimes, you will be stuck on a team where some to all of the success rides on you and a few other players. Your other teammates may be inexperienced, not as athletic, or just not trying hard. Either way, try your hardest and don't blame yourself if you lose. Volleyball is a team sport and therefore, the whole team is at fault for a loss, if any fault is to be placed. 7."	Volleyball, more than many other sports, is a sport in which your body, mind, and soul are required for success (and you thought we were just crazy!). Make up some cheers, celebrate every point you earn, create a relationship with the coach.

This the condition of your teeth being too close together or overlapping in some areas. * You might have spacing problems if your teeth are too far apart. * You may have an overbite problem if your top row of teeth bite forward ahead of your bottom teeth. * You may have an under-bite problem if your top row of teeth bite behind your bottom teeth. * You could have a combination of these or other problems. 3. Ask your insurance if they cover Invisalign. Invisible alignment treatments costs are similar to that of standard braces. Dental and orthodontist coverage may apply to Invisalign the same way as braces. * Invisalign, just like braces, costs between $5,000 and $6,000. * Insurance may cover half of the treatment cost, but contact your provider to be certain. * If you proceed with the Invisalign treatment, regardless of coverage, you can ask your doctor about a payment plan to help with managing the cost. 4. Find a doctor near you. You want to find an American Dental Association licensed dentist or orthodontist near you that can administer the Invisalign treatment. * This treatment can last for months or a couple of years so you want to make sure you find a health provider that is close by. * You want to also confirm that the provider you choose is covered by your insurance company. 5. List questions you need and/or want to ask the dentist. This treatment will have a major impact on you or your child's health, and is a significant investment of time and money. * Be especially clear on questions of daily life with the aligners, length of treatment, and cost. * You might start a consultation first with something such as, ""Does my overbite and crowding condition need braces?"	.

You may think that you could never get sick of your crush, but you're more than likely wrong. Once you see the same movie, listen to the same song, or watch the same interview so many times, you'll just be tired of it. Soon, you'll realize how silly it was to have obsessed over a trivial person. This doesn't mean you can't appreciate their work or talent, but you certainly don't have to make them the center of your attention at all times.

In fact, it can be pretty nice to go wherever you want, order whatever you want, drink whatever you want, and have a whole table to yourself. * If you feel like being a bit social, sit at the bar to eat. People sitting at the bar tend to be friendlier and more open--and to have better stories. * Go to one of your favorite restaurants and order the meal you’ve been craving. Bring a book along if you’d like, or enjoy your meal while people-watching. 2. Take a long bath or shower. If your house is usually full of people waiting to use the bathroom, take this time to spend as long as you want in the bathroom. * Take a leisurely shower. Use all of your favorite bath and body products. *	Light candles, turn on music, and allow yourself to relax.

Start with gentle backswing. In order to generate power for the serve, you must shift your weight to your dominant foot. However, to fool your opponent, it’s important to bring your racket back in a slow, steady motion as you would for a normal low serve. * Make sure that to keep your grip on the racket relaxed as you move it for the backswing. That can help keep the motion slow and gentle. 2. Use your wrist to flick the shuttle. As you bring the racket forward to hit the shuttle, you must suddenly increase the speed so your opponent doesn’t recognize the flick serve until the last moment. With your wrist and forearm, generate enough power to flick or snap the shuttle over your opponent so they don’t have a chance to hit it back. * As you flick the shuttle, you should rotate both your shoulders and hips so they’re facing your opponent. * When you’re just about to flick the shuttle, try to tighten your grip. Press your thumb against the back of the handle to make sure you’re holding it tightly enough. 3. Complete the follow-through. After you flick the shuttle with the goal of lifting it over your opponent, make sure to finish your swing’s follow-through.	.

Know_Which_Insurance_to_Take_on_a_Rental_Car.txt	Begin_Revision	0.926	## Steps	710	And , personal auto policies that extend collision coverage to a rental car may only provide a coverage limit equal to the value of your own vehicle .	## Steps	754	Personal auto policies that extend collision coverage to a rental car may only provide a coverage limit equal to the value of your own vehicle .	<delete><And><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><personal><3><Personal><1>	True	Steps  1. Know the limitations of your own car insurance. When you rent a car, most private auto insurance companies' coverage (the coverage you have on your own personal automobile) transfers over to the rental vehicle during the time the rental is utilized by you. If you allow additional drivers who are NOT on your personal auto policy, you run the risk that if those persons are operating the rental, they, and the damages they cause, will not be covered. 2. Find out what the rental agency supplemental coverage is. If you get into an accident in a rental car and your personal auto policy transfers over to the rental (which most auto policies nationwide do) then the extra insurance you buy from the rental agent is considered EXCESS to your own personal auto policy. This means that your policy will pay out first, and any damages above your policy limits will be covered by the rental carrier. This is with the exception of collision on the rental car. For those damages, you will pay your deductible to repair the rental, and your carrier will pay the remainder. * The only way that you are excused from this is if the other party is at fault OR you opted for the additional insurance, because that additional insurance covers damages to the rental car, but not for the property damage of others unless it is in an EXCESS capacity. 3. Many drivers are somewhat covered for the average rental (assuming it's for pleasure and not business). If you own a car, talk to your insurance agent. The same coverage and deductibles you carry on your car will apply — in most cases — to a vehicle you rent for leisure use. Be careful. If your policy provides minimum coverage, you may need to compute the value of the loss or damage of a newer vehicle (the rental car) and decide if you need to supplement your coverage. 4. For example, if you decline LDW at the rental counter and rely on your own insurance, you probably would be responsible for paying your usual deductible. Also, a loss-of-use fee is not normally covered by personal auto insurance policies.	If the value of your personal vehicle is less than that of the rental vehicle, you could still incur some damage responsibility.

Know what the appraiser will be looking for. There are various items appraisers consider when conducting their appraisal inspection. Some of these are: * location * exterior and interior condition * total room count * functionality, including interior room design and layout * improvements to kitchens and baths, windows, the roof and the home’s systems (heating, electrical and plumbing) * the condition and age of the home’s systems * exterior features such as garages, decks and porches. 2. Consider the reason for the appraisal. What you hope to get out of an appraisal depends on your reason for getting one in the first place. Whatever the reason, the key is finding an appraiser who is experienced, and who knows your neighborhood. Here are some scenarios, and what to look for: * Refinancing a mortgage, or obtaining a home equity loan/line of credit. In this situation, you want the highest appraisal possible. If you're aware of recent sales of properties similar to yours, let the appraiser know. Be prepared to tell the appraiser if, and why, you feel your house may be worth more than those others. * Contesting a tax assessment. Here, the lower the appraisal the better. If your neighbors' houses are comparable to yours, find out what their tax bills are. You can simply ask, or check the records at your local tax assessor's office. Tell the appraiser if their bills are less than yours. * Selling your home. Obviously, you're hoping for a high appraisal. Again, inform the appraiser if your house has improvements or features that some of the similar, recently-sold houses in your neighborhood didn't have. 3. Gather documents that may aid the appraiser. Appraisers appreciate anything that will make their job easier. So try to have helpful paperwork available, such as: * A plot plan or survey of the house and land. * The most recent real estate tax bill and/or legal description of the property. * Home inspection reports, or other recent, more specific inspection reports, like for termites, septic systems and wells. * A title policy that describes encroachments or easements (you likely got a copy of this when you bought your house). 4. Find comparable properties. Websites like Realtor.com will give you information on recent sale prices for homes similar to yours in your neighborhood. As mentioned above, it would be helpful if you could have this information available for the appraiser, to at least give him or her an idea of what the going price is in your neighborhood.	This would include things such as:

Love and accept them. The most important thing is not to blame them. It is easy to get frustrated, but remember that a disability is not their fault. 2. Remember that you're not the only one getting frustrated. Autistic people don't ""do it on purpose"", and they can't help many of their idiosyncrasies. They're not trying to annoy you or being intentionally difficult. They're doing the best they can with what they have, just like you are. 3. Speak clearly to help them understand. Be clear about your thoughts and feelings, and give occasional pauses so they have time to think and consider how to respond. Avoid exaggeration if they don't understand figurative speech well. * Make sure that you have their attention before you launch into something important. If they are ""zoned out,"" they might not realize that you want to talk, and might not hear a word you say. Say their name, and see that they look up or acknowledge you before you begin to talk. * Don't force them to make eye contact or stop stimming when they listen. This can make it very difficult for them to concentrate. 4. Assume that they are competent and intelligent. A girl who doesn't talk and constantly flaps her arms may still be very capable of understanding what you are saying. 5. Try to give the family member's life structure. Aim to not change things on the spur of the moment. 6. Keep with them. Some autistic children will wander off or leave the house. If you're in a crowded place like an amusement park, hold their hand or keep them in your sight. For children at home, lock the door with a deadbolt higher than they can reach. 7. Don't get frustrated with their communication. Some autistic people love to talk passionately about their special interests, or need to ask lots of questions before they feel that they understand. * If you are feeling drained, or need to do something else, just politely explain that you need to go do something else. You have a right to set boundaries. 8. If they are still school aged, talk to their teacher(s) before school starts. 9. Make lists. Some autistic people struggle to remember to do the most mundane things. Even a teenager or adult may benefit from having a list of things to do every morning, like ""brush your teeth"", ""take a shower"", etcetera. * Consider adding pictures to the list, especially if the person is young or has limited reading skills. * The list can be hidden in a drawer if the person is embarrassed by needing it. 10. Make a schedule. Include everything that goes on in a day. If the person is school-aged, include things like ""leave for school"", ""get home from school"", ""do homework"", ""eat a snack"", etcetera. Be sure to include free time! 11. Laminate the schedule so that temporary changes can be made, such as when somebody comes to visit, or when school is on vacation. 12. If a last-minute change must be made, write it on the schedule in dry-erase pen as soon as possible. This will give the autistic person time to get used to it and understand it. If this is not possible for some reason, talk to the person about it as soon as possible. Again, this gives the person some time to get used to it. Never assume that the person will like the surprise or that that makes it okay not to tell them about it ahead of time. * Change can feel very unnerving and upsetting to autistic people, even if it is a good change."	Tell the autistic person if you plan to take him or her to a fast food restaurant to play on the toy (if they're that young), or out to dinner, or anything that's not routine for them.

When you begin a new sport, one of the first things you do is get in shape. Every sport uses different muscle groups and stretches new areas of your body, which means that you will concentrate on different exercises in order to get in shape. 5. This is no different with horseback riding. Some say that riding isn’t a sport, which I think is ridiculous. Horseback riding uses several different muscle groups depending on the discipline, and requires that you be in shape to perform. 6. Horseback riding typically uses the following muscle groups: 7. Shoulders 8. Triceps/Biceps 9. Abdominals 10. Back 11. Inner Thigh 12. Inner Calf 13. Outer Thigh 14. Back of the Calf 15. You will use different combinations depending on the type of activity, but these will be used every day. In order to stay in shape and to perform best while you ride, there are several exercises you can perform on a daily basis to help stretch, strengthen, and tone these muscle groups. 16. STAIRS 17. If you have stairs in your home – perfect. If not, a stair stepper will do or a step ladder if you have one. 18. Stand on the stair with just the front part of your foot at the edge (about as much as would be in a stirrup). Slowly stretch down and lower your heels until you feel the stretch in your calves, and hold for ten seconds.	.

Before you can begin a career (or four years anyway) of service to your country, you need to talk to a military recruiter.

However, your recruiter can also be your best friend and they will generally bend over backwards to help you. If you are honest with them, they will play straight with you. In the end though they are salesman, and you should stay on your guard in the same way you would a car salesman; if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 2\.

They will give it to you. If given an option between money and promotions, take the money. A minor promotion from E1 to E2 is meaningless when you arrive at your first chain of command. You will still be treated as low man on the totem pole regardless of your rank. 3\. Once you've enlisted, its time to prepare yourself for basic training, or bootcamp as its commonly called. Bootcamp turns your life upside down and can be very long; three months long if enlisting in the Marine Corps, but a little preparation before starting can make your time there easier. 4\. Excersise. Run, do push ups, pull ups, sit ups and crunches. The more physically fit you are before arriving at basic training, the better off you'll be. Not only will you need less time adjusting to the physical demands of basic training, but you'll make a good impression on your Drill Instructors. Arriving at basic training over weight and lacking strength can make you a target for Drill Instructors, and in extreme cases, add time to your basic training. You can't begin training until you meet military standards for weight and strength. If you don't meet those standards, you will be put on a physical training routine until you do. This means spending weeks or months more at basic training. 5\. Study. If you ask your recruiter he/she will give you books that you can study from. Knowing basic knowledge and military jargon before arriving at basic training can help you stand out from the crowd. That can be a good thing. 6\. Practice basic training routines. Speed and motivation is everything in bootcamp. Drill Instructors will constantly test your ability to do things quickly and without hesitation. While at home, fill a laundry basket with 6 pairs of socks, 6 pairs of underwear, 3 pairs of pants, 3 shirts, two notepads, all your hygiene gear, a couple of books, and two pairs of shoes. As quickly as you can, dump everything out of the laundry basket onto the floor and mix it up a bit by kicking it around a little. Now stack everything on your bed in a neat fashion. That means having the cloths folded, the hygiene gear aligned in a neat way, your books and notebooks stacked neatly, and your shoes sitting next to each other with the laces tucked in. Do this repeatedly until you can do it in under 15 seconds. You'll have similar ""test"" in basic training, and you won't be given as much as 15 seconds to complete the task, but its a good start. 7\. Start sitting on the floor now with your legs crossed. Most of the time when your sitting down in basic training, you'll be doing it ""Indian style"". While it doesn't sound difficult, it becomes hard when doing it for many hours each day. Practice sitting with your legs crossed, your back straight, and your hands on each knee. You'll have to do this without moving a muscle for long periods of time while in basic training. It gets easier with time, so it's a great benefit to get used to it before arriving. 8\. Learn to swim. If you can't swim when arriving at bootcamp, then you're going to have a real hard time when it comes time for swim qualifications. All branches do it, and especially the Navy and Marine Corps. An inability to swim can set you back in training and extend the time you spend in basic training. 9\. Now you've finally arrived at basic training. Immediately your Drill Instructors will be looking for the leaders in the group. You want that to be you. Being a leader in bootcamp has its advantages."	Speak up when you see your fellow recruits doing things they're not supposed to. Stand up straight with your chin high, and don't be lazy. All this things will help you stand out from the crowd.
Help_a_Dog_Recover_from_a_Broken_Leg.txt	Begin_Revision	0.801	### Performing First Aid	1098	Also , do n't try to re-set the bone yourself .	### Performing First Aid	1192	Do n't try to re-set the bone yourself .	<delete><Also><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><do><3><Do><1>	True	Performing First Aid  1. Examine the injured leg. If you see your dog limping, take a look to see which leg is injured. The broken leg could be really obvious, such as an exposed, open fracture. In this case, you’ll need to keep the wound clean. If it is a closed fracture, your dog may be limping but there may not be any blood or obvious wound. Whatever type of break, you’ll need to apply first aid and get your dog to the veterinary hospital right away! 2. Clean the wound with a saline solution. If you can see an exposed wound where the leg is broken, you’ll need to clean the wound. Put on some plastic gloves. Rinse the wound with water or a saline solution. Then, flush the wound with a non-astringent antiseptic. 3. Bandage and secure the wound with first aid tape. Wrap a clean bandage around the wound several times. You want to wrap it snug but without applying too much pressure. Wrap it around a bunch of times, including above and below the exposed wound. Secure the bandage with first aid tape. * If you don’t have a clean bandage or gauze, you could use a clean towel. * You should check to make sure your dog’s dressing is not too tight. It is important to make sure the dressing is comfortable and not impeding circulation to your dog’s limb. 4. Put a leg-splint on your dog. You should prevent the fracture from getting any worse by applying a simple leg-splint. Use a medical splint or, if you don’t have one, a ruler or a spatula will do the trick! The splint should cover the entire area of the fracture. It may go all the way up to where the leg meets the abdomen. Tie the splint to the leg with a bandage and secure it with medical tape at the top and the bottom. 5. Use a towel as a sling to move your dog to the carrier. Your dog will have a hard time walking to the carrier or the car, so you should assist them. Wrap a towel or a blanket around their abdomen. Hold some of their weight with the towel while they walk to the carrier or the car. * An easy way to do this is to pass a large bath towel under your dog’s belly. Hold the end up over his back, like a sling, to support his weight. 6. Restrain your dog in a carrier. Because your dog could move around on the journey to the veterinary hospital, you should restrain them. Lay them down with their injured leg up in the carrier. Use the carrier to transport them to the hospital by car or taxi. * Since injured dogs can become aggressive, you may want to put a muzzle on your dog before taking them to the veterinarian. 7. Get your dog to the veterinary hospital. You’ll need to get your dog to the veterinary hospital as soon as possible. Drive them or, if you don’t have a car, get a taxi. On the way, try to keep your dog warm and comfortable. * If your dog was involved in a vehicular accident, it is especially important to get them to the hospital quickly because they could have internal injuries in addition to the broken leg. * Keep your dog warm on the way to the hospital. * You could ask a friend to comfort your dog in the back seat while you drive. 8. Avoid self-treatment. You’ll need professional veterinary treatment. So don’t use ointments on the open fracture.	.

Approach the dog indirectly. If you approach a dog you wish to interact with before adopting it directly, it might interpret the approach as threatening. Instead, approach the dog by sidling along the dog’s cage or housing unit so that only your side is exposed. In other words, the dog should see you in profile, rather than seeing you coming at it head-on. * Approaching the dog you want to interact with before adopting it in this way will make it more disposed to approaching you in a friendly way. 2. Ignore the dog. Once you’ve come close to the dog you want to interact with before adopting it, you should interact with the dog’s foster owner or handler only.	You could request that the dog be let out of its cage to get a closer look at you. This will give the dog time to assess your personality and mannerisms.

Observe thick and stocky legs. Because of its status as a ground spider, mouse spiders have very thick and stocky (almost muscular) legs. Female mouse spiders will have thicker legs than male spiders. In addition, the male mouse spider may have long palps that appear as an extra pair of legs. 2. Look to see they are 20 to 35mm (.8 to 1.4 inches) long. Both male and female mouse spiders range between 20 to 35 mm in body length. The females, however, tend to be toward the longer part of this range. 3. Notice that they are the right color. Male mouse spiders are dark blue or black in appearance. Female mouse spiders tend to be dark brown in color. However, there is some variation between the 8 different species of mouse spiders. 4. Watch a bright red color on the front part of the male. Male mouse spiders can be either red or black on the front of their body. This bright red color is a tell-tale sign of certain mouse spider species and should not be dismissed as another sort of spider. 5. Look for short spinnerets. Spinnerets are the part of the spider’s body that typically spins the web. They are found near the front/head of the spider. Mouse spiders, as ground spiders, have very short spinnerets.	.

Convincing enough for you? 2. Skip the lubricants. A sperm's best friend is not an artificial lubricant. Though some say they don't have an effect on fertility, it's best just to avoid them all together. If you can, do. * For those that need a lubricant, go for something more natural. Mineral oil or canola oil can be substituted. 3. Relax. You know how when you're stressed, it can mess with your cycle? You don't have to make much of a leap to understand that it messes with your baby-making skills, too.	Sex! Fantastic.

Figure out if she knows. Before you get too hasty, this is a good question to think about before taking any action. Consider the following would letting her know that you ""like"" (and possibly love) her make this situation any easier? For some, this might help you and your best friend create ""boundaries"" to make the process easier. For others, it might just freak your friend out and things may never be the same. However for most, your intuitions are correct and they secretly like you as well. It might be hard for your friend to admit, so try to gauge an answer from them. 2. Come up with a list of ""boundaries"" that will prevent you from getting into any tempting/heart-breaking/bittersweet moments. For instance, maybe you sleep over often (more contact means you have a change of getting over your crush), or maybe you should try to get into conversations about her love life (and yours). These types of conversations can really tell you about their interests and if they could be interested in you. Be careful though - BE THERE for your best friend! Do not neglect the important conversations (even about her normal life, etc.) if they are needed! Remember, you ARE her best friend and she is counting on you in every way! 3. Now, you don't really need to write down this list, but maybe it'd help you to remember some promises you are making to yourself. Be careful though! If she (or anyone else) finds it, it might be super awkward! 4. Hang out with other friends! It is hard to get into someone when she is the only person you ever hang out with! Spread your time - chances are your other friends have been really neglected (and maybe you have some apologizing to do...). 5. Find a new way to ignite the potential crush. Now this is kind of like 3, and as hard as it sounds, it is do-able! Get yourself out there! Be careful though, do not try to find a ""replacement"" for your best friend! If your best friend is blonde-haired, blue-eyed and loves carving cheese animals, do not try to find someone else who is the same! YOU WILL LIKELY SUCCEED! And not only will you be sorely surprised, but your best friend will look ""terrible"" in comparison, and you will only long for her more."	.

Acknowledge when you’re feeling crappy. Emotional awareness is the process of recognizing and acknowledging your feelings. Having emotional awareness can equip you to properly manage and improve your mental hygiene. When humans feel a certain emotion, generally, there is a physical or mental reaction that accompanies it. Paying attention to your own physical and mental cues can help you identify when you are experiencing specific emotions. * For example, you are sitting in a restaurant. A friend is meeting you for lunch. She is already 10 minutes late. You think “Geez, she always has me waiting.” And, you notice yourself tapping your straw repeatedly against your water glass. Both the resulting thought and action help you realize that you are feeling impatient. * Choose a span of time to observe your thoughts and actions. How do they clue you in to your emotional state? Record these observations in a journal as a first step towards greater emotional awareness. 2. Express your emotions in a healthy way. After you have learned to spot the mental and physical cues of your emotions, you can then find positive ways of expressing them. Emotional expression is necessary as withholding or suppressing your emotions can lead to unhealthy outcomes like depression or anxiety. There are many ways you can express your feelings in an adaptive way. * Talking to others is one of the best methods to getting your feelings out. Just be sure that whoever you are sharing with is supportive and non-judgmental. Consider a best friend, a sibling, or a counselor. * Writing about your feelings is also helpful. Jot down your thoughts into a journal. Over time, you can look back on these entries to see if any patterns emerge. Journal writing is naturally good for mental health, especially when it is used not just for venting, but for problem-solving, too. * Cry if you need to. When people feel sad, they may withhold this emotion out of guilt or shame. Other times, you may feel sadness, but be unable to cry. Watch a movie, read literature, or listen to music that speaks to your emotional state to help you shed those tears. * Release the tension. Anger can be one of the most difficult emotions to express because what you do when you are angry may not be socially acceptable. For example, it may not be a good idea to shout at your loved ones, break things, or punch walls. Instead, you can use some of the same stress management techniques to conquer anger. Try completing a vigorous workout or screaming into a pillow. 3. Understand that both negative and positive emotions are essential. Humans like to express joy, excitement, and love. But, it may seem like the right thing to push away negative emotions. You may have been raised on the idea that showing anger, shame, or frustration was a no-no.	.

Be more understanding of the rules she makes and know that they are for your best interest. 2. Help her out. Your mom cleans, cooks, and cares for everyone around her. She deals with a lot, so the least you could do is give her a hand. Try cleaning up after yourself and others. Keep your room in order. Wash the dishes. Clean the house once in a while. If you have any younger siblings you could tell her to take a break and spend time with them to take them off her hands. You can try cooking every once in a while. Make breakfast in the weekend for your family. 3. Tell your mom how much you appreciate her. Say thank you when she does something for you. Genuinely thank her when she cooks for you, cleans for you, buys something for you. Randomly tell her that you love her and give her a hug. On special occasions write her things saying how thankful you are to have her, etc. 4. Make her feel good about herself. Compliment your mom on her food. People feel horrible when nobody likes their food. Your mom works hard to cook the meals she cooks, tell her how much you liked the food and that she should make it again. Tell her how good she likes any time. Especially when she makes an effort to dress up. On special occasions when she puts on more makeup, wears that new dress, does her hair, tell her how great she looks. She put a lot of effort into how she looks.

Respect – and vocalize – your own perspective. More to the point, learn to value your perspective. If you tend to be relatively passive when interacting with others and hope to become more assertive, you need to both recognize and more frequently verbalize your needs, feelings, and opinions. The best way to do with is by reminding yourself of your specific needs and desires and actively communicating them directly and respectfully with those around you. * Working to increase your assertiveness will become a self-fulfilling process as soon as you begin; even the slightest increase in your assertiveness will help you convey what you’re thinking and feeling more effectively. * When you notice you have a need or desire that is not being met, perhaps in part because you haven't vocalized it, think about how you want the situation to be different. * It may help to write out the needs and desires you intend to better vocalize, or talk about them with a close friend. Practice identifying and vocalizing your needs and desires so you feel more confident about asserting yourself when it is necessary to do so. 2. Start increasing your assertiveness in one particular domain. It will be easier to be more assertive within one area of your life first. This does not mean you should be more assertive with those who are younger than you or in a less experienced position in your work environment. Instead, look to be more assertive with those who know you well and will likely respect your more active participation in social interactions. * Be specific.	.

Determine whether or not you're a poseur. It's not uncommon for you to be trying too hard, but if you want to be honest with yourself, you need to answer this question: Am I trying to be something I'm not? If you want to fit in with a certain crowd, impress people or draw attention to yourself, you're only lying to yourself, and you may end up losing the true you. It's okay to like the Gothic fashion and not be a Goth, and it's okay to listen to the music and not be Goth. If you're forcing yourself to act a certain way or trying too hard to be something you truly aren't, then just stop, because when you lie to yourself, it is incredibly clear to others. If you simply admire certain aspects of the lifestyle, try just merging them in with your own style. The whole part of being a Goth is about being yourself and being unique: not a crowd follower. 2. Get away from the stereotypes. Like anything that ventures away from the mainstream culture, the Goth lifestyle has been heavily labeled and stereotyped. If you are trying to discover whether this style suits you, it's important that you don't fall into any of the silly ""Goth Rules"" that poseurs or ignorant people may preach about. These include the commonly incorrect beliefs that: * All Goths wear black. Although a lot of Goths do wear black, there are so many different styles that you can explore with, from Cyber Goths to Romantic Goths. Corsets, long skirts, hair falls or cabaret outfits are only some of the clothing preferences that many Goths enjoy, and colors can be anything: even pink and black. * All Goths are depressed and suicidal. This is probably the most outrageously untrue of all the stereotypes. Many Goths possess a quirky, dark sense of humor, and everyone in the lifestyle is completely unique: nobody is the same. Although not every Goth in the world is happy, you don't have to be self harming or crying all the time to be a Goth. * Goths are into drugs, alcohol and sleeping around. This again, is completely untrue. Although of course, some Goths may be reckless, this all depends on your own personality, not whether you're Goth or not. Goths are as intelligent as anyone else. * Goths worship Satan or evil spirits: This is one of the reasons people wrongly assume Goths are ""freaks"". The vast majority of the time this is not true. There are many goths who are Atheist, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Wiccan (who don't believe in Satan)... Just be yourself and believe, or not believe, in what you want to. 3. Evaluate your music taste. There are no ""rules"" to being a Goth, and there never have been."	Goth is a music based subculture. Therefore, someone who is listens to a large portion of Goth Rock is a Goth. As there are many different sub genres of Goth Rock, there are numerous genres of music and artists you may listen to.

You need to start with a commitment. And a first step. 2. Warm up. Five to 10 minutes on the elliptical if you can. 3. Do less. Forget about 3 sets (unless you really are a professional athlete). One set of 10 to 20, but there has to be enough weight to tire the muscle without straining. Yes, for most of us less really is more.

Register or join a neighborhood watch group. Youth are at a higher risk of engaging in delinquent behaviors when they live in communities where they feel unsafe. By creating or joining a network of civilians committed to preventing crime, you can help foster feelings of community safety and make it clear that you don't stand for gang violence. * Neighborhood Watch does not advocate taking action—they support community members aiding law enforcement by reporting crimes or suspicious behaviors. * On average, there is a 16% decrease in crime in Neighborhood Watch communities compared to regions that don't have one. 2. Create an early intervention program for at-risk youth. If your community doesn't have an early intervention program for at-risk youth, create one yourself. Focus on creating an environment for positive recreation that provides youth with the tools needed to learn interpersonal skills, such as conflict resolution. * Programs should have classes or get-togethers specifically for parents and teachers of disruptive youth that want to learn how to manage them effectively. * Intervention programs give at-risk youth a non-judgmental environment to learn adaptive skills and provide them with a sense of community. 3. Develop workshops that focus on developing positive life skills. At-risk youth need help learning how to boost self-esteem, manage anger/conflict, set realistic goals, improve personal awareness, foster healthy relationships, and value education. * These programs can provide similar benefits as gangs, including a sense of identity and belonging, protection from violence, and a tight structure that mirrors that of a family. 4. Remove graffiti from your community. Gangs provide people with a sense of belonging, which appeals to youth with no other place to feel accepted. By reducing the sense of gang identity in the community and engaging in the aforementioned volunteer activities, you can show at-risk youth that there are other places to turn. * Graffiti is a sign of territorial dominance. Removing these signs reduces the chances of violence between rival gangs. It also sends out the message that the community will not stand for gang activity. * Some communities allow residents to help cleanup graffiti. Ask local law enforcement about how you can participate in the cleanup process. * Graffiti removal typically involves using a wire brush to remove paint from various surfaces using a chemical graffiti remover.	.

It is one of many hepatitis viruses to be taken seriously. The virus attacks the liver and causes inflammation. Most people have no symptoms at all and, therefore, don't know they have an infection until years later, when routine medical tests discover liver damage. Hepatitis C passes from one individual to another through contaminated blood.

Publish articles around your keywords on as many sites as possible. There are quite a few article sites that have articles you can use or edit for your needs. Then there are article submitters that will place your article on a bunch of sites at once for you. 2. Consider starting a 'webzine'. There are also webzines,(online-magazines), that specialize in articles, and have large memberships that will possibly read your article and hopefully follow a link to your site that you place with the article. Using this method causes links to your site from the sites you've put it on and results in more traffic. * Be wary of content farms. Google search is not nice to them. 3. Another great way to get traffic is to join the social sites. They are popping up at an ever-increasing rate. By socializing with others on the net through these sites, everything you join or participate in gives you more people to see your site. And, if you're selling stuff from your site, you'll want to go to the places (interest groups) on the social site where people are interested in what you're selling. 4. Distribute an E-book all over the Internet with your links in it. These can be made quite easily with software you can get by searching on Google or by checking at the bottom of this article for a link. These can also be put on social sites and webzines for them. Again, wherever you put them causes a link back to your site. 5. Set up a blog. These are a very good method for getting traffic to your site and they are free. You can start one at one of many free blog sites. Then you set up a feed for content and then go to other blogs with the same topics or fields of interests and read and comment on their articles. As well a lot allow you to post your article which gives you more traffic. 6. Have a Press Release. There are sites that will send a news type story about your new product or info on your site to a lot of other sites. Some of these are pay sites though, so you have to watch out. 7. Use Google. Google Adwords is the most popular method for traffic. Since they are the top search engine right now it make sense to advertise there if you can afford it. You bid on keywords to get your site at the top of the search when your keyword comes up. There is more involved but it's all laid out at Google. There are a lot of other sites that use this advertising strategy called pay per click or PPC. 8. Submit your site to search engines. Another popular way of getting traffic is with a search engine submitter, where a site will send your link to many search engines at once for a price. The more search engines you want to be on, the higher the price. There are a few free programs you can use but they usually don't submit to too many at once. 9. Buy leads from a lead selling site. These are supposed to be email addresses of people that have signed up to receive offers. You just have to watch that they have good fresh ""double opting"" leads of people who requested more information about your particular field or you could be marked as a spammer. Some of these sites will email them for you with your own email or you can buy separate leads and use a separate email site for the mailing. There are email programs you can use but then you have a problem that Internet providers usually only allow up to 500 emails per day, and if you're doing it every day they might (rightfully) accuse you of spamming and shut down your connection. 10. Buy A Responsive Targeted Opt-In Email List. You’ve probably heard people say, “the money is in the list.” What does this mean? In online marketing, an email list is the best form of communicating with your customers. Even though social media gets a lot of attention, the most valuable digital channel is email. 11."	The only way that you can maximize your marketing value is by building a list.

If you want to do some other things before your homework (watch TV, go on your laptop, etc.), realize that you'll probably have more time to do them after you've done your homework and you will be able to enjoy them more. If you do those things first, you will realize later that you still have a bunch of homework waiting and you will have less motivation. If you know you can do all those fun things after your homework, you will be much more motivated. Once you start procrastinating, it's hard to stop and do something productive because it might seem too boring. 3. Make sure you don't do your homework too quickly.

Get the lightest frame you can buy when you get a new bike. The frame is the base of the bike, and the most expensive part you can buy. Getting a new frame usually means buying a brand new bike -- unless you have amazing brakes, pedals, gears, and handlebars on your old bike, it is rarely cost effective to buy a new frame and transfer everything over. When shopping for frames, there is a definite hierarchy in frame weight. * Carbon-fiber: The gold standard for light-weight bikes, carbon fiber is, unfortunately a bit brittle. You will never see it on a mountain bike, but racing, triathlon, and high-end road bikes are almost exclusively carbon fiber. * Titanium: Stronger as steel but much lighter, titanium is another high-end option often found on mountain and road bikes. * Aluminum: Strong and light, aluminum frames are the one of the most common frames you can buy in any bike. * Steel: Sturdy by heavy, steel is most common on mountain bikes, which are less concerned with lower weights than their pavement oriented cousins. 2. Switch out your wheels for an easy, immediate fix. Perhaps the best ""bang for you buck"" fix is to get lighter wheels. You will not only lose weight, you'll become markedly more aerodynamic. Lower spoke-count wheels and wheels made of finer material will all help lighten your bike. What constitutes an ""upgrade"" depends on what you currently have, however, generally speaking, you can't go wrong with a few sure-fire light fixes: * Carbon-fiber wheels * Tubular wheels * Aero wheels 3. Make sure you're using the proper tires. Mountain bike tires, which are big and knobby, are going to kill you going up a paved hill. If you find yourself riding more roads than trails, purchase a set of commuter or ""cross"" tires, which are lighter, offer less friction, and can still accommodate light trails riding. 4. Switch to a double crank in your front gears. Look at your chain rings, which are the big metal gears next to your right pedal. If you have three, you should consider purchasing a ""compact crank,"" which gives you two chain rings. While you'll have less gears to work with, you will loose weight. * If still want to keep the gears but lose the weight, you might compromise with an extra gear in the back, known as your cassette. That said, many riders find that, after 1-2 weeks of riding a compact crank, they forget they ever had the third ring. 5. Pick up aerodynamic handlebars. Carbon fiber bars or specialty aerodynamic bars, like triathalon bars, will shave off weight and dampen some of the vibrations around your hands on bumpy roads. Remember, however, that carbon fiber is somewhat brittle, and thus not a very good idea for mountain bikers. 6. Remove any unessential hardware. There are a lot of additions people put on their bike that, unfortunately, do nothing but add weight. Get rid of any unnecessary saddlebags, lights, fenders, mudflaps, pumps, decorations, and reflectors, especially if you are riding on a dry day outside of a city. * If you're going on a short ride, drop any extra water bottle cages, though you should always have at least one water bottle present unless water will be provided by the race. 7. Wear an aerodynamic pair of shoes and helmet. While this is mostly for racers, lighter, Lycra shoes and aero helmets cut down weight keep you quick, and look professional. 8. Consider race trimming your bike if you feel comfortable with mechanics. Not for the faint of heart, race trimming involves shaving off every possible gram of weight you can. Professional rider Jack Pullar is perhaps the most extreme example, as he ripped off the seat covering and drilled holes out of his saddle, then sawed off the bottoms of his handlebars, to loose weight. While you should be careful, some race modifications include: * Sawing off your seat post 1-2 inches below where you have it set. * Trimming the ends of all your cables and cable housings. * Removing water cages and bolts. 9. Know that you are usually saving grams, not pounds. Unless you're willing to shell out $15,000 for a high-end, pristine 11lb bike, you're not going to be losing that much weight, ever. Switching a lighter gear set and derailleur, for example, saves the equivalent weight of 1/3 an iPhone 4."	If you're entering the Tour de France, you'll want the absolute lightest bike you can get. Otherwise, stick to a few bigger, more cost effective fixes and work on getting stronger legs, not a lighter bike.

Mentally prepare yourself for the ordeal and the pain from rejections to follow. Firstly prepare your mind to bear the situations to come. 2. Take the initiative to greet them. With a smile. This is important. You be good no matter what the circumstances that member creates for you. Emerge the better person in any argument they start. Make sure to let them know there is no hostility on your part. 3. Find out why they don't like you. Their hatred must stem from some cause, right? Do some asking around. Then after you find out, resolve the matter with them. Clear out misunderstandings. 4. Keep up your good behaviour in front of them, this is more helpful in case of elders. Praise them in front of others and compliment them time to time but don't overdo the flattery. 5. Do these steps. Don't falter. It'll only be a matter of time til they come around. After all, they're human so their hearts are bound to melt. 6. Keep them in your prayers, think well of them. Thoughts are energies that actually exist and travel from one mind to another.

Lower_High_Blood_Pressure_Without_Using_Medication.txt	Begin_Revision	0.67	## Steps	6307	Also , many drugs are stimulants .	### Part Two: Other Strategies	6402	Many drugs are stimulants .	<delete><Also><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><many><3><Many><1>	True	"Steps  1. Avoid table salt (sodium, sodium chloride, NaCl). Sodium causes you to retain fluids, which makes your blood have more fluid volume. When your blood has more volume, your heart has to pump harder to move that excess volume throughout the body. This causes the blood pressure to go up. Remember, it's not just the salt that you put on your food while cooking or at the table, it's also the amount of sodium that's in the prepared foods that you buy. You should become ""label conscious"" and buy ""low salt/sodium"" or ""unsalted"" foods. Avoid preserved foods, canned and bottled foods (such as meats, pickles, soups, chili and such), bacon, ham, sausage, bakery products and MSG (mono-sodium glutamate), meats with added water, also, have higher/added sodium content, as well as prepared mustard, salsa, ketchup, Bar-Be-Que and other sauces. Many American diets include up to 5,000 milligrams of sodium daily which nearly all medical professionals consider extremely unhealthy. Medical professionals often prescribe ""low sodium diets"" that consist of between 1100 and 1500 milligrams daily. The American Heart Association advises that the human body actually can function with as little as only 200mg of sodium daily. If one can't live without a ""salty"" flavor, there are multiple brands of seasonings that amount to herbs or fake salt products on the market. Not just low or ""lite"" salt products but salt substitutes (potassium, potassium-chloride, based for example). 2. Eat a moderate, lean diet and avoid stimulants. Avoid caffeine, white carbs (although pastas are not as quick to form sugar as breads, pastries and cakes are), candy, sugary drinks and excessive dietary fats. Try eating a more plant based diet, instead of so much of meats, milk and eggs. Use less caffeine. Stopping coffee and other caffeinated beverages will lower blood pressure. But, even one or two cups of coffee can raise blood pressure into the unhealthy Stage 1 level. If a person already has Stage 1 Hypertension, the coffee usually complicates the problem further because caffeine is a nervous system stimulant. Thus, agitated nerves cause the heart to beat faster, which raises the blood pressure. If you are a person who drinks a lot of caffeine (more than 4 caffeinated drinks/day), you may need to taper yourself off of the caffeine to prevent withdrawal symptoms such as headaches. * Increase fiber. Fiber cleanses your system and helps control your blood pressure by having digestive regularity. Most vegetables are high in fiber, especially those with leafy greens. Many fruits, nuts, and legumes (beans and peas) are also rich in fiber, as are whole-grain products. 3. Stop smoking. Smoking causes your blood pressure to elevate because of the stimulants in the cigarette smoke. If you stop smoking, you can not only lower your blood pressure, but you can also help your heart to become more healthy and reduce your chances for other health-related diseases including lung cancer. 4. Lose weight. Carrying around extra weight causes your heart to work harder all the time and this increases your blood pressure. Imagine having an extra 20 pounds (9 kg) on your body. That would be the same thing as carrying around a 20 pound (9 kg) bag of dog food. Try walking around the block while carrying this bag of dog food. Soon, your heart will begin to beat faster and harder, you'll become out of breath, and you'll feel very tired. Eventually, you'll get to the point where you can't wait to put that bag down. Imagine how hard it is for your body to carry around that extra weight all the time! Unfortunately, many of us are carrying around a lot more than just an extra 20 pounds (9 kg). By losing this extra weight, your heart won't have to beat as hard and you'll lower your blood pressure. 5. Avoid drugs and alcohol. Excessive use of drugs and alcohol can damage many organs in the body including the liver and the kidneys. When these organs are damaged, they can cause a build-up of fluids in the body. As mentioned in step one, extra fluids make the heart beat harder and this increases the blood pressure."	These cause the heart to beat faster. As stated earlier, the faster the heart beats, the higher the blood pressure goes. By cutting out drugs and alcohol you'll succeed in reducing your blood pressure. Also, remember above where the common warning about sodium was described? Some over the counter medications such as simple headache remedies like Ibuprofen cause the body to retain sodium. So, people who are already complicating their high blood pressure condition with sodium also are retaining that sodium more than the body naturally would which causes even higher stress on their systems.

Monitor calories. Although vitamin and mineral supplements may be able to support weight loss, it's generally difficult to lose weight without modifying how many calories you eat each day. * Most health experts will recommend you cut out about 500 calories daily. This is a slight decrease that results in about a 1-2 pound weight loss each week. This is considered slow, gradual and safe weight loss. * Try using a food journal or food diary app on your smartphone to help you keep track of how many calories you're eating each day. 2. Eat a well-balanced diet. In addition to monitoring your daily calories, it's important to eat a well-balanced diet daily. This will help ensure you're meeting your daily recommended amounts of vital nutrients. * Most of your required vitamins, minerals and other nutrients should come from foods (supplements should only be used as a backup). Eat foods from each food group most days and include a wide variety of foods from within each food group daily. * Stick to appropriate portion sizes as well. Following the right portion sizes helps ensure you're eating the right amounts of each food. Stick to: 3-4 oz of lean protein, 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy greens, 1/2 cup of fruit and 1 oz or 1/2 cup of grains. 3. Snack wisely. Snacks can be a part of a nutritious diet and even be a part of a weight loss plan. Be smart about what you choose and how often you snack. * Typically its recommended to keeps snacks at around 150 calories per snack when you're trying to lose weight. * Also try to include a lean protein or a fruit or vegetable in your snacks. These foods provide your body with the nutrition and energy to keep you going throughout the day. * Snack only when you need to. For example, a pre or post workout snack is a good idea or a having a small snack between two meals that are more than 4 hours apart. * Examples of nutritious, low-calorie snacks include a hard boiled egg, an individual greek yogurt or an apple with a cheese stick. 4. Limit liquid calories. One thing that can sabotage your weight loss is liquid calories. They can slip into your diet without you even feeling full or satisfied. * Limit beverages that are full of sugar and calories. For example, limit: regular sodas, juices and juice cocktail, energy drinks, sports drinks, smoothies, and alcohol. * In addition to limiting liquid calories, try to get between 8-13 glasses of clear, hydrating fluids each day. Being adequately hydrated can support your weight loss. *	.

The more sugar you add, the stronger hold your hairspray will have. For extra hold, add 2 teaspoons (10 grams) of sea salt. 3. Remove the saucepan from heat, and the mixture cool before adding 8 drops of your favorite essential oil. You don't have to add the essential oil, but it will give your hairspray a nice scent when you use it. You can use any type you like, but citrus or lavender essential oils are popular choices when it comes to hairspray. 4. Carefully pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Stick a funnel down the neck of a spray bottle.	Try to use a glass spray bottle, especially if you are using essential oils. Some people find that essential oils cause plastic spray bottles to degrade overtime.

Script/Screenplay - This is the first and the most important step. You can do this in a few hours and we highly recommend you do this yourself, since you know your product best. You can always get your aspiring writer friends to give it a gander for edits and to check that people get it. Here's a format for this: User has need; Prospective user trying; Existing/competitor products; User getting screwed/losing money/being frustrated; Eureka moment! There’s an answer!; Introduce and pitch your product; Quick run-through of product; A great outcome for user; Write out your story first and then break it up into chunks much like a storyboard or screenplay. 2. Sketch Video frames - Here’s a dirty secret: artists usually need money. Find one. Friends, family, design students - all it takes is a doodle. You know what? Doodles are hot now anyway. Plus, here’s the beauty, you can pick whose style you prefer. Once you have your one person Pixar, have them draw up images based on the storyboard you created. You probably need 30-40 screens for a 90 second pitch. An artist can whip up a doodle in a few minutes (it’s a doodle after all), so this will probably take them a few hours - let’s say $200. Add in a little more for correction, and time on your part to review. Your time: 1 hour; Your cost: $300 3. Voice Over and Sound - Someone’s got to talk, unless you are making a silent film. But you don’t need to go from Charlie Chaplin to Don LaFontaine (Don’t know him? Google, and you will). It’s surprisingly easy to put on your narrator voice, and besides, you want a more ordinary voice so it stays relate-able. Ask your pals to do the voice over; my roommate did it and it only cost me $10 in beer. You can get your sound effects and background music for free by Googling. We recommend Creative Commons licensed work, all of which are free and many of which can be used commercially. Your time: 1 hour; Your cost: $10 4. Glue - You have the screenplay, the images, and the audio. But now, you have to put it all together to make the video. If you’re a whiz in After Effects, you got this! However, not all of us are so Hollywood. You can count us in the latter category, so we contracted it out.	If you only ask them to stitch your 90-second film together, it won’t take much more than 2 days for someone who has done this before. You can use a freelancing site to land the person. Again, we’ll add some time and money for review and corrections. Your time: 2 hours; Your cost: $650

Find a box, like a shoe box or ice-cream container. Put reptile carpet as big as the box. If you have a larger lizard it might be best to buy a plastic container. 2. Put in your decorations. It might be best to have a small light bulb if your lizard needs the warmth. 3. Put in food and water; like crickets or commercial food products. Make sure you feed your lizard correctly, and giving him plenty of water. You can do the below but it will cost more money.   1. You can go to the local pet store to buy a tank. The size of the tank depends on the type (species) of lizard. 2. Then you have to add a flooring (sand, wood chips, etc.) The type of flooring and how much flooring depends on the type of lizard. Consult your vet and/or pet store 3. The type of decorations depends also on the type of lizard. An example may be a bearded dragon, who climbs trees. For that you can put a stick or two in the tank. You can find a stick outside and wash it off with soap made to not be poisonous to reptiles. (If you do not wash it off, it could contain germs which could kill your lizard. If you do not want to do this, you can buy sticks that will be even safer to your reptile but for a cost. In past experiences, I've found them to be about $20! 4. Also, most lizards need a warm side and a cool side. You can put a heating light that you buy at the pet store. Depending on the type of lizard, you may have to have two lights, one different light, or no lights at all. You can ask the pet store and/or the veterinarian. (This isn't as related to the article, but if you have a lizard [or any reptile] that you going to keep as a pet, you should prepare for an emergency and know which vet [one that specializes in reptiles] your going to take your lizard to. Also, once you find or buy a lizard, you should take it to your reptile vet for a checkup.) You should also have two thermometers: one for each side of the tank. 5. Also, most lizards need a hiding place.	You can buy these at the pet store.

Choose your rope * First, you need to pick a rope, from which the lead line is going to be made. An approximately 6 mm rope will work very well. 2. Choose the length you want your lead line to appear * Now you need to decide what length you want the finished lead line to be. Short lead lines (3-4 feet) are great to use on ponies, average lengths (5-6 feet) are used to lead horses from one place to another, long lead lines (9-10 feet) are used for Natural Horsemanship training and ground work. 3. Cut your rope * Using scissors, cut your rope in the length you want. Take an extra foot or two, as the braiding shortens the rope a little bit. * You'll need 3 equal pieces to make the lead line. 4. Start the braiding * In order to start making your lead line tie the ends on one side together, to keep the braiding from falling apart. * Put your three pieces or rope in front of you. * Start by putting the right piece over the center piece. *	.

Choose a color for the pillow. Society tells us that stuff for baby girls must be pink, and stuff for baby boys must be blue. You can choose to abide, or use a more multi-sex color like yellow, red, or greed. Buy a roll of cheap plain fabric and the softest material (perhaps felt, not muslin) you can find with the desired color. There is the option to dye it. 2. If you do not have any pillow stuffing, purchase some. It should be springy, not something the baby could sink their head in to. Do not go overboard with expensive stuffing; a cheap, bouncy stuffing can be purchased at most warehouses. 3. Decide on your preferred method of sewing. Sewing with a needle and thread is enjoyable to some, while for others, it's a pain. If you do not have your own sewing machine and you would rather not do it manually, borrow a friend's. Put the sewing machine aside and take out the cheap fabric. 4. Cut two squares of equal size. It should be roughly 28cm by 28cm or 25 by 25. Iron both pieces. Leave one side unsewn, and leave yourself a 1.5mm semilounce. Use a color thread that is the same as your out-side fabric. Start sewing! 5. Stuff the pocket through the open side and sew it closed. This is your inner. Put it aside where it will not be damaged. The outer squares should be approximately 2.5cm higher and wider than the inner. Cut out the outer squares, being careful to cut evenly; the outer is the best looking part. 6. Do not change thread. Iron both pieces. Sew it like the inner, leaving one side open for stuffing. This time leave a 20mm semilounce. After sewing, stuff the inner into the outer via the open side but do not sew shut. 7. Change thread and bobbin with a close color. eg. original thread color- green; change to blue. Original thread color- red; change to pink. Sew the opening shut. 8. OPTIONAL: go to the store and buy some decorative badges- for boys, cars and such. For girls, butterflies and other 'girly' things are good. Sow those on and there you have a not-quite-finished baby pillow. Make sure to wash before giving it to somebody. 9.	Newborns are highly prone to illness so make sure it is free of bacteria.

Getting nutrient-rich, whole, low-sugar foods can help both of you to stay healthy and maintain your weight, which in turn may help relieve some symptoms of diabetes. * Eat about around 1,800-2,200 nutrient-dense calories a day, depending on how active you are. If you are trying to lose weight, decrease your calorie intake by about 500-800 calories per day. * Some of the best and most healthy foods for diabetics and their spouses include: beans, dark green leafy vegetables, citrus fruit, sweet potatoes, berries, tomatoes, whole grains, nuts, and fat-free milk and yogurt. These foods can help ensure you get all of the nutrients you need to maintain your health and weight and control your diabetes. * Aim to fill your half of your plate with non-starchy vegetables such as beets, carrots, cauliflower, squash, snap peas, and asparagus. If you are getting frozen or canned versions, make sure they do not contain any added sugar. * You will likely have to decrease or eliminate the amount of sugar you eat, especially if it is from refined sources such as cakes and cookies. Instead, eat fruits like blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries to satisfy your sweet tooth. 2. Plan meals and restaurant trips. Your and your diabetic spouse can plan weekly meals together. Not only can this be a fun activity for both of you, but can help manage your weight, sugar, and may that you’re getting plenty of nutrients. * It’s always good to start off your day on the right foot with a healthy breakfast together. You can choose a variety of foods to make a healthy and satisfying breakfast for both of you such as an omelet with cheese and veggies and a side of whole grain toast and fruit. * Some studies have shown that allowing yourself occasional cheat days can help you maintain a healthy diet because you’re not denying yourself anything. * Eating at restaurants can prove a major pitfall for many diabetics and their spouses because of processed foods with hidden sugar. * Ask for substitutions when you can. For example, ask for a salad or extra broccoli instead of French fries. * Order desserts with whole fruit or even a fruit platter for dessert. * Make restaurant reservations for a time that you won’t have to wait for a long time and run the risk of disrupting your spouse’s blood sugar. 3. Drink enough to stay hydrated. It’s also important to your health to stay hydrated.	Making wise choices can help you stay hydrated, manage weight, and control your spouse’s diabetes.

Make_a_Healthy_Sandwich.txt	Begin_Revision	0.9	### Choosing Nutritious Breads and Wraps	517	However , many lettuces , especially dark greens , are also high in nutrients like fiber , vitamins and antioxidants .	### Choosing Nutritious Breads and Wraps	614	Many lettuces , especially dark greens , are also high in nutrients like fiber , vitamins and antioxidants .	<delete><However><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><many><3><Many><1>	True	"Choosing Nutritious Breads and Wraps  1. Choose 100% whole grain breads and rolls. Your basic sandwich is generally made with bread, on a roll or in a wrap. If you're going to choose one of these items or something similar, boost the nutrition of your sandwich by choosing whole grains. * Whole grains are a more nutrient dense and healthier option compared to refined grains (like white bread). They're less processed and contain all the parts of the grain. * Whole grains are typically much higher in fiber, minerals and even protein compared to refined grains. * If you're going to choose an item like bread, a wrap, English muffin, bagel, flatbread or deli thin, go for 100% whole grains. * Look at the food label to make sure your item is 100% whole grain. The ingredient label should list only 100% whole wheat or 100% whole grain flour. 2. Try out a tortilla or a wrap. If you want to minimize your bread intake or just try something a little different, consider using a tortilla or a wrap. You can wrap up your sandwich fillings for a quick meal. * Both tortillas and wraps are flat and are not as high in carbohydrates or calories compared to many types of bread or rolls. They're also a little bit less filling since they're just less food overall. * Again, choose 100% whole grain if you can. Many corn tortillas are automatically whole grain as well. * Be wary of what size wrap you buy. Many come in 6"", 8"" or even 12"". The bigger they are, the more likely it'll count as 2 servings of grains. Stick to a 6"" wrap to minimize calories and carbohydrates. 3. Use portion controlled deli thins. Many bread companies are jumping on the low calorie, low carbohydrate band wagon by developing ""deli or sandwich thins."" These are rolls or bread that are very thin, low in calories and carbohydrates. * These deli thins are a great substitute for regular bread. Many companies make them in 100% whole grain versions, have added fiber and protein. * Sandwich thins are also usually low in calorie as well. Some may only have about 100 calories for both pieces. This may be lower than other breads or rolls you've used in the past. * Again, read the ingredient list to make sure that these products are truly 100% whole grain. 4. Consider using lettuce instead of bread. Another way to add more nutrients (and fewer calories) to your sandwich is by using a lettuce wrap. This is a fun twist on a classic sandwich that can also make it healthier. * Lettuce, like other vegetables, is naturally low in calories."	.

Pass the dried corn through the coarsest setting. Adjust the mill plates/stones to the machine's coarsest setting. Place the dried corn into the hopper, then crank the handle to grind it through the machine. * Make sure that you have a bowl or other container beneath the grain mill to collect the processed corn. * When using an electric grain mill, you'll need to switch on the power instead of turning a handle. * The exact method for adjusting the mill plates will vary by machine, so you'll need to consult the instructions for your grain mill to determine the proper procedure. Usually, though, you can adjust the coarseness using a knob on the side of the machine. * Note that you should work in batches of about 2 cups (500 ml), which is the approximate amount used in these instructions. When making larger quantities of cornmeal, work inn multiple batches. 2. Sift the product. Dump the coarsely ground corn into a fine-mesh strainer. Gently agitate the strainer from side to side to separate the finely ground pieces from the coarser chunks. * Ideally, you should use a mesh strainer with gaps measuring between 1/32 and 1/16 inch (0.8 and 1.5 mm). Larger mesh strainers may pass pieces that are too coarse to be classified as meal. * Collect the small pieces that pass through in a separate bowl placed beneath the strainer. Return the larger pieces caught in the strainer to the hopper of the grain mill. 3. Grind the corn using a finer setting. Adjust the mill plates again, setting them to a medium-grade coarseness. Grind the large pieces of cracked corn through the mill as before. * It's important to change the coarseness to a finer setting during this step; otherwise, too few of the larger pieces won't be ground down any further. 4. Sift the product. Transfer the newly ground corn pieces back to the fine mesh strainer. Rock the strainer from side to side, allowing the finest pieces to pass through into the previous collection bowl for your cornmeal. * You'll likely collect more cornmeal during this sifting than you collected during the first, but in most cases, you'll still be left with a notable amount of coarse grain caught in strainer. 5. Pass the corn through an even finer setting. Adjust the grain mill once more, setting the machine to medium-fine consistency. Return the larger pieces of ground corn to the hopper, then grind them through the machine a third time. * While the machine needs to be set to a finer degree of coarseness, you'll probably need to avoid using the finest setting. Even at cornmeal consistency, ground corn can be too coarse to pass through most mills' finest setting. 6. Separate the remaining meal and grits. Sift the ground corn through the mesh strainer one more time, collecting the fine meal in your original bowl and retaining the coarser grits. * At this point, you should have more cornmeal than leftover grits, and the amount of cornmeal should roughly match the original amount of dried corn you began with. * If you're still not satisfied with the amount of cornmeal produced, however, you can pass through the coarse grits through your grain mill one more time. Afterward, sift them again using the mesh strainer. The amount of cornmeal produced by a fourth pass will likely be less than the amount produced by the previous two passes.	.

Green chemistry is a modern science of chemistry that deals with the application of environmentally friendly chemical compounds in the various areas of our life such as industrial uses and many others. This area of chemistry developed by the need to avoid chemical hazards that organic and inorganic compounds had on the body of humans and animals. Most chemical compounds whether they are naturally made or are synthesized in the laboratory have negative effects on the human body although they are beneficial on a commercial basis. Especially notable are organic compounds which can easily penetrate the hydrophobic skin layer and enter the body. There it can exert an effect by binding to macromolecules in the body and alter their structure or interfere with their normal metabolism. 2. Green chemistry was developed by virtue of the need to overcome this hazardous effect that toxic compounds exert on the body. This relatively new area of chemistry uses water as the medium of chemical reactions that are done in the laboratory. Chemical reactions are usually done in a medium that is called solvent. An exception is reactions that take place in the gas phase where there is no need for medium there. Sometimes chemical reactions are done in a neat fashion. Namely the reacting compounds are mixed and reacted together with the need for a solvent. This is one of the methods that are used in green chemistry to avoid pollution and the hazardous effect of the volatile solvent. 3. Solvents in general and organic solvents in particular form a major health problem for humans due to their volatile nature. Solvents disposal is another problem. In the organic laboratory most solvents are relatively hydrophobic in their chemical structure. Some other solvents possess certain degree of polarity in order to fit for certain types of reactions that involve compounds with polar groups. Organic solvents can affect the body by penetrating the skin intact surface by virtue of its hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer. This is a major problem when handling such organic compounds that are used as solvents. In addition some other solvents such ethers can form peroxides if left in an atmosphere of oxygen such as in the free air. This can potentially form explosive material that can harm the chemist that is using them. Also other compounds that are used as solvents can trigger cancer such as benzene and chloroform and methylene chloride. These two latter solvents exert their effect by forming a very reactive carbon species in the body under the effect of a base that is located in the body such as bicarbonate ions. These carbene species can react with amino groups in the DNA basis and cause mutation of the whole structure of the molecule. 4. Inorganic solvents are usually less volatile than organic solvents. The problem with inorganic compounds is that they can be corrosive to humans such as the use of acids and bases. Inorganic compounds can function either as Lewis acids or as Lewis bases. Therefore they can react in the body causing harmful effect to the cellular structure. Some organic solvents can solubilize the phospholipid bilayer of the cells by virtue of their hydrophobic structure. Thus it can destroy the type of cells that are affected. For these aforementioned reasons green chemistry was developed. 5. Water is currently used as the favorite environmentally friendly solvent in this area of chemistry. The problem with this compound is that it is very polar. Thus it fits only certain type of chemical reactions that involve polar structure. Water is usually used in electrolytes chemistry in the area of analytical chemistry as a medium of chemical reactions.	Thererfore, careful choice of the reactants in a specific type of reactions is required to avoid reaction of the water solvent. The problem with water as a medium of chemical reactions is manifested in particular in organic reactions.

If your pet is a cat,dog, or horse, put a cute Christmas costume on them! PetSmart has the best of costumes for cats and dogs. Horses, well, go to a horse stall or, frankly, ask your mom. If they don't cooperate with costumes, they can just wear a Christmas collar in a snowy background.If it's a caged animal, decorate their cage by cutting out fabric or paper decorations. Paper decorations can be printed out from Google. 2. Then plan out a funny caption, like 'Why can't I be a reindeer?' or 'There's Santa Claus!'. On the inside, you can do something like 'Merry Christmas!' or 'I'll deliver your presents to you like I deliver the newspaper.' Then you can do 'Best wishes, (you or your family's name) or something like that. 3. Then, get your pet to be still by a bribing of a treat. Take a couple pictures and decide which angle is best. Take off the costume or decorations and reward them with a treat. Then, print out as many photos as you need. DON'T wast the ink. It's very precious. Then, get some construction paper and cut + fold it to your liking.Then, ask a parent (if you're under 10 years old) to hot glue the back of the photo to the front of the paper. 4. Then write whatever you want to write on the card. 5. Then get small Christmas stickers or paper decorations (personally, I think stickers are better) and stick or hot glue the decoration(s) to the edge of the photo. 6.	.

If he still doesn't like it, then don't use a costume at all. Instead, decorate the area that will be the background in the picture, and see if you can get an action shot of the animal (for example, a dog jumping). * If it's a caged animal, decorate their cage by cutting out fabric or paper decorations. For the latter, you can either search for them online and print them out, or make them yourself! 2. Plan out a funny caption, like 'Why can't I be a reindeer?' or 'There's Santa Claus!'.

Because everything you need will be in one place, you don't need to waste time rummaging through cupboards.   1. Open the can of chick peas and dump them into your colander or strainer. Rinse them well and place them into the food processor. 2. Using your measuring spoons, carefully portion out the salt, baking soda, and vanilla extract. Then, add them to the food processor. 3. Next, grab your measuring cups and use the correct cups to measure out your peanut butter, milk, oats and brown sugar. Add these to the food processor as well. * It's okay to measure out a little extra peanut butter. It sticks to the measuring cup and sometimes it's hard to get it all out. 4. Blend the ingredients until the mixture is very smooth. * It should have roughly the same texture as regular cookie dough when you're done 5. (Optional) Empty the mixture into a mixing bowl. 6. Add chocolate chips to the chickpea dough and stir until the two are evenly mixed together. 7. Put plastic wrap over the top of your food processor or the bowl you've moved the dough into. Then, place the mixture in the fridge and allow it to cool down for at least a half an hour. * Often, the processor heats up and makes the dough warm, and it's much easier to make into balls for cookies when it's chilled. 8. (Optional) If you want to stop here, this makes a great edible cookie dough dip that is also gluten free! 9. When your dough is almost done chilling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. * Make sure you check the oven to be sure no one else has left anything inside. 10. Ready your baking sheets by either spraying a nonstick cooking spray on them, or by grabbing parchment paper, cutting it to the length of your baking sheet, and laying it on the top of the sheet. 11. Pull the dough out of the fridge and take off the plastic wrap. 12. Using a spoon, carefully roll a ball of the chickpea dough onto the cooking tray. Keep repeating until you run out of either space on the tray or dough. * Some people like to use an ice cream scoop so that every dollop is perfectly uniform. If this creates your desired cookie size, then feel free to try that. 13. Once the oven is fully heated, carefully place the tray(s) on one of the inside racks.	.

They may be hot enough to burn your skin, and sometimes they will fall apart. * If you don't have cooling racks, take the cookies out five or so minutes early and allow them to cool while on the baking sheet. * Be careful of this strategy! If you let the cookies bake the full 20-30 minutes, they will keep cooking while the tray is heated and may burn. 15.

Have Amy's great hair. Go to your salon and ask for hair with shorter layers around one side of the face, and a side part. Amy also has brown hair, so if you want, you can dye your hair as well. To style your hair like Amy's, spritz volumizing spray onto the roots of your hair, followed by a shine serum from the mid-length to ends. Then, straighten your hair all around and part it to the side. If you don't have a straightener it may be a good idea to invest in one. 2. Make you skin great, like Amy's. The best way to have clear skin is by: * Drinking plenty of water * Eating healthy and avoiding starchy and sugary foods * Using a gentle cleanser for dry skin, such as Cetaphil, and an acne cleanser for oilier skin, such as clean and clear. * It is also a good idea to moisturize your skin. If you are more prone to breakouts, try Cetaphil daily moisturizer. * Use a mask and exfoliate once a week or so. Neutrogena has an excellent and gentle exfoliating scrub. For acne prone skin, try a mud mask. A simple mask that works for all skin types to spread honey on your face, and leave it for about 10- 15 minutes. 3. Apply pretty but simple makeup. The most you should wear in order to look like her is a natural pink gloss, concealer over blemishes and other such areas, mascara on the top lashes, eyeliner on the upper lid of the eye, and a light beige and golden brown colored eye shadow. Amy is very trim and healthy. The easiest way to lose weight or become more toned is by running a mile every day; you are sure to get healthy in no time. However, if running does not appeal to you, there are plenty of other ways to exercise such as dancing, tennis, biking, swimming, and even belly dancing! 4. Be trim and healthy. The easiest way to lose weight or become more toned is by running a mile every day; you are sure to get healthy in no time. However, if running does not appeal to you, there are plenty of other ways to exercise such as dancing, tennis, biking, swimming, and even belly dancing. Emulate Amy's style during her pregnancy if you wish, she wore flattering clothes for either pregnant or less slim body shapes. 5.	She is very into layering, stripes, and bold colors. Go for black and white sweaters and black dresses. Clothes like hers can be found at Lord & Taylor's, Forever 21, Free People, and even places like Hollister. Ashley claimed Amy never met a scarf she didn't like, so try some scarves if you like.

Identify it to make sure it's venomous and if it's not going to spit venom at you. 2. When you found out what type of snake it is, use a snake grabber to grab it's head lightly. If you push it too hard you might squish it, But if you don't have a snake grabber, try to find something like it cause it's nearly just a stick that can grab things. If nothing like that is in reach, then you can just get two sticks and try to pick the snake up. Careful to pick long sticks! 3. Now that your holding the snake with the sticks, you must slowly calm it down by playing softly with it. Yep, it's CRAZY but other wise it will be mostly impossible to take outside. Snakes are very fast so you must always be alert! If it drops, and try hard not to drop it or they might break some bones, pick it up and just continue to play with it slowly. Try to make the sticks in a form of a tree. 4. If it's a Common Spitting Cobra, then it's different. You must put some goggles on, for swimming would do perfectly, and strap a cloth on the upper part of the goggles (on you fore-head) Why? So that when the Spitting Cobra spits, and it will aim for the eyes, you would be protected by the goggles, and the cloth is so that if the cobra misses, it wouldn't run down to the eyes. P.S. it's better to stay 2 meters away from it because then it will be difficult to aim at you. The venom will not harm your skin (when they spit)however, it is venom and if it runs down into a cut, then it will act as venom.  5. So as the snake calms down, you should slowly and gently go outside and, with the sticks, put it GENTLY(!) on a near by tree. 6. do NOT through it. do NOT through salt at it ( as some people think it makes them go away) do NOT drop the snake or harm it for it could be a rare snake. do NOT chase it or scare it away for it will just go and hide in the nearest gap. 7. If you want to keep a venomous snake it will be hard work. First you must find a proper cage for it and make sure you close it or it will escape!  8. then you must buy a snake grabber or just a grabber (same thing!) so that you can hold it's food with it and put it in the cage. And also to grab it if he escapes(!) 9. buy or catch some food for your snake. Most eat rats and mice, some small ones eat frogs, but some, like the King Cobra, eat other snakes. First better to research about your snake. 10. you should have two cages. 1. for it's usual use and 2. to put it in when cleaning the first cage. 11. clean the cage by using the snake grabber. Always grab the snake on the head (GENTLY!) so that it wont be able to bite you.(!) 12. To extract it's venom, you should get 1 jar, a rubber band and a cloth. put the cloth on the jar (like a jam jar) and stable it with the rubber band.	.

Keep a daily log of what you have said and done, and what other's reactions to it was. Laughter is not neccessarily a good reaction, and being ignored is usually a good reaction. * It's easer to make freinds with ""outcasts"" and ""social rejects"" (Nerds, Jocks, Preps, Goths, Emos, any sterotypical group.). That doesn't mean you should start acting like them though! They are usually ""outcasts"" because they behave in a way contrary to the social norm, and while they might know what the social norm is, and can switch when they need to, the same is not true of you. Watch the behavior of normal people. (People who are friends with more then one group, or cross groups, and the people who don't have labels) * If someone hurts your feelings you may have touble telling them so. You can't make the facial expressions, or proper tone of voice to inform them non-verbally, and they may not believe you if you tell them out and out without the non-verbal backdrop. Tell them anyways. Lay all your emotions out like a book, don't hide them. From your perspective you are ""normal"" and they're the ones who are disabled and can't read you. If they continue to behave in such a way that hurts your feelings expalin the situation and why you can't make the right cues. If the behavior still continues try to ignore them, get help, or file suit (Depending on the situation). You have to decide which one is approprate. Filing suit usualt works best if you feel that they are sexually harrasing you. Getting help works best if they seem to be doing it maliciously. Trying to ignore them works best if it seems, in the end, unintentional. * There is no room in your life for prejudice. You will have less of an ability to meet people and make freinds then others. Don't compound your problems with prejudices. Muslem or Hindu, Zionist or Orthidox, Red or Yellow, Left handed or Right Handed, Labor party or Neo Nazi, everyone you meet has the potential to be a freind. If you don't like their opinions on politics or religion then don't talk about politics and religion, and ask them not to talk about those topics around you. If you don't like their color, or their handedness, or something else they cannot help, try to get over it, you need to learn how. If you cannot accept different people, why would you expect normal people to accept you? * Do not touch another person unless they give you explicit permission, and then touch them only in the maner they have given you permission to do. Do not ask for permision to touch people unless touching them is nessessary for some reason or other. If a person is unconscious, you need not ask permission to check for a pulse, attempt to wake them, or perform CPR. If a person is choking, and cannot breathe you do not need permission to perform the Heimlich maneuver. If a person is sleeping do not disturb them unless they had asked you to before they went to sleep, and the situation meets the criteria under which you were told to wake them. You may touch them to wake them without asking permission only if nothing else seems to. * Sarcasm may be hard to detect. The best way to decide is to use prior experence, and what you yourself feel you would do in their situation to guide you. Please be careful. Misinterpreted sarcasm can be dangerous! * Watch other people, keep a log of what they do and other's responses. Base your own interactions with people off of this log. Also keep poetry or short stories written by yourself in the log. Or doodles or artwork, or something else you are interested in. If someone asks you what you are writing in the log book show them these. You might be able to have a conversation and make an aquaintance, or even a friend. * Small talk can be hard, and it's often hard to tell when someone wants small talk, or to exchange information. A good cue that what they are talking about is small talk is if they mention the weather, or sports. Learn about sports, so you can have small talk ""conversations"" about it. If you don't feel like having small talk then bring a book to read, or something to work on with you, and work on it ostentatiously. People will usualy leave you alone * Do not talk about politics or religion. If the person agrees with you then you might get some brownie points, but that is outweighed by the risk that they might not agree in which case you have just brought up a very emotionaly charged topic which can ruin a friendship, or make them hate you. * People will often say ""no"" in a playful fashion. With normal people that is fine because they can hear the subtext. With you it is not. When someone says ""no"" don't do what you asked them if you could do. If someone says ""stop"" stop. * Similarly people may not even actualy say ""no"" at all, but rather simply not say yes, and expect it to be understood. Or worse they may say ""no"" but not with their lips, rather with their face or voice. They may even be saying ""no"" when it sounds like they are saying yes. Play it cautiously. Look for changes in behavior that might signal such things. Listen and watch them carefuly. If you cannot tell, or are unsure, assume that their response is negative. * On the other hand playing it too cautiously can make it hard to meet people. Try to throw yourself into social situations and meet as many people as possible. The trial and error learning method can help, and practice also helps. * How can you tell which of the two methods to use? If you are too cautious you can cut off your chances of meeting people. If you are two forward you can put people off (upset them) or worse. So which do you use? In a professional relationship it is best to be cautious. The results of upsetting your boss/teacher/policeman/person-you-need-to-help-you is a greater threat then the gains of befriending them. On the other hand, with your peers you want to balance the two behaviors; you don't want to be too forward, but you don't want to be too cautious either. It may take you years to find the right mix of caution and action, but don't give up. * When you are a kid is your chance to experiment. Kids and young adults are much less accepting of differences then adults are, but you can do almost anything when you are a kid and get away with it. So you should be very forward when you are a kid. Do not let yourself get shy. You will be rejected by many people, but some people will accept you. * It's even harder to get a girl/boy friend for you than normal people, because if you try there is a larger chance that you will get slapped with a sexual harrassment suit. The best place to meet people, therefore, is on a dating site... provided you are careful about whom you select. * With instructions and directions, a lot is often left unstated. If it seems like there is any possibility of ambiguity ask them (The instructer) to clarify. * In the USA sex works under a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. It is inapprorate to have a conversation regarding sex except with a sex partner, and then only in private. * Practice your speech patterns. Get a recorder, speak into it, and record it. Play it back. Listen to yourself and compare your voice to that of others. Change your speach patterns and try again. Keep trying until your speech patterns are similar to those of people you speak with regularly. This is especially important with stress and emphasis. It is also importent to try and match speeds. People who talk too fast are often seen as hyper, or energetic, and people who talk too slow as laconic or lazy. * Your voice may have a nasal quality. Try to work that out. Singing lessions can help with this. If you are tone-deaf it is harder, but still possible. * People will possibly think you are lying, even when you are being truthful. The best way to avoid this is to always tell the truth, to the best of your ability. If you need to lie, lie by omission... or say nothing about the thing you need to lie about. * Maintain eye contact, but do not stare. This is a hard one. The best way to acheive it is to look at their left eye for a while then shift to their right eye. Obviously this is not possible if they are not facing you, and/or you are not facing them. Even if they are not facing you, try to face them when speaking to them. it helps to practice with your reflection in a mirror * You may be thrown for a loop (Greatly confused) by figures of speech, like the one I just used. Get a slang dictonary, and learn figures of speech. A web-search could also help. Treat figures of speech as their own words. * You may be clumsy or uncoordinated. In this case, practice makes perfect. Try doing artwork and other small lines and motion with your fingers, also try to throw a ball into the air and catch it. Dancing helps with your foot coordination and biking helps with your balance, as does roller blading. * Remember that Aspergers is a combined disorder... It often manifests with several other disorders. Below are some of them * You may have trouble with math, reading, writing or communication * If you have trouble writing, try to type everything important. Type all assignments and letters, then print them off. Avoid writing things. If it cannot be typed try to get someone else to help you write it. If that canot be done try to do it yourself. In a classroom situation ask the teacher or professor permission to bring your laptop into class to take notes, or ask for some form of keyboard or electronic notetaking system. If that doesn't work try to meet with a psychologist or psychiatrist. Find out if you realy need it. If you do need it, then get classified as Dysgraphic. The school will now make consessions such as allowing you to use your laptop in clas as per the ADA (American Dissabilities Act). If they let you use the laptop or writing device you do not need to get officially classified (You might want to anyways so you can use it for the essay section of the ACT or SAT). Do not abuse the privilege of having the laptop, use it only for note taking. If you cannot get officialy classified as dysgraphic then try to get a friend or relative in the same class as you to share their notes. Or just try to deal with it. Note taking is important. * If you have trouble with math then don't worry to much, calculators exist for a reason. You might find that even though you can't add or subtract, or multiply easily, you can still do more complicated stuff, like working with formulas, or geometry. Do not give up hope. If you still have trouble consult your psychologist or psychiatrist. They will be able to help you better then I am able. * If you have trouble reading try to figure out how bad it is. You might just have to breakthrough, and read a lot for a long period of time until you get good at it."	.

You might just have to breakthrough, and read a lot for a long period of time until you get good at it. Otherwise find some tips for dealing with dyslexia, and consult your psychologist or psychiatrist. * You may experence sensory overloads. * If you have trouble with loud noises, to the point that it hurts your ability to participate in a class or at work tell someone in charge. Get permission to wear sound mufflers at work or in class. Shooter's earmuffs help a great deal because you can still hear normal noises, but loud noises are filtered out. This will set you apart from other people, and make you seem odd though, so think carefuly if you realy need it. * If light bothers you, get sunglasses; if certain colors bother you, get them tinted to the opposite of the color so that it appears black or grey in your vision (Red-Green, Yellow-Cyan, Blue-Magenta). Sunglasses are also often concidered ""cool"" which means that they are usualy acceptable * If you have problems with touch get soft comfortable clothes, and wear your less comfortable work clothes (Or suit, or whatever) over them. (Like underwear) * If you only like certain foods pack them and bring them with you to lunches/dinners. If people ask why just explain that you have special dietary requirements. * If you have troubles with smells find something that you like the smell of and dab it under your nose. It should overcome other scents. * You may have simptoms similer to (Or even have as well) ADD, ADHD,OCD or OCPD. Here are some ways with dealing with these * If you have ADD- or ADHD-like symptoms you will probably be easily excitable, quickly bored, and have trouble focusing on the task at hand. Sometimes the only solution in sight is pills, but you can occasionly overcome these yourself. I couldn't, so I can't help you here. * If you have OCD or OCPD like traits you will tend to obsess over things, and have special patterns and methods that must be followed or you start feeling upset. It may hamper your ability to share a space with someone, or the obsessive thoughts may disturb you, or make you behave oddly. I don't really have this problem very bad, so I can't really help you. * It's easy to get depressed when you have AS. This is because you don't have a good network of friends to help you get undepressed. The best solution for depression is to do something, or change some aspect of your life. If that fails or is impossible try to get into a mantra of living in the now, so that if you are depressed it won't last long."	If all else fails or is for some reason impossible there is still Prozac and other such pills.

The results of upsetting your boss/teacher/policeman/person-you-need-to-help-you is a greater threat then the gains of befriending them. On the other hand, with your peers you want to balance the two behaviors; you don't want to be too forward, but you don't want to be too cautious either. It may take you years to find the right mix of caution and action, but don't give up. * When you are a kid is your chance to experiment. Kids and young adults are much less accepting of differences then adults are, but you can do almost anything when you are a kid and get away with it. So you should be very forward when you are a kid. Do not let yourself get shy. You will be rejected by many people, but some people will accept you. * It's even harder to get a girl/boy friend for you than normal people, because if you try there is a larger chance that you will get slapped with a sexual harassment suit. The best place to meet people, therefore, is on a dating site... provided you are careful about whom you select. * With instructions and directions, a lot is often left unstated. If it seems like there is any possibility of ambiguity ask them (The instructor) to clarify. * In the USA sex works under a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. It is inappropriate to have a conversation regarding sex except with a sex partner, and then only in private. * Practice your speech patterns. Get a recorder, speak into it, and record it. Play it back. Listen to yourself and compare your voice to that of others. Change your speech patterns and try again. Keep trying until your speech patterns are similar to those of people you speak with regularly. This is especially important with stress and emphasis. It is also important to try and match speeds. People who talk too fast are often seen as hyper, or energetic, and people who talk too slow as laconic or lazy. * Your voice may have a nasal quality. Try to work that out. Singing lessons can help with this. If you are tone-deaf it is harder, but still possible. * People will possibly think you are lying, even when you are being truthful. The best way to avoid this is to always tell the truth, to the best of your ability. If you need to lie, lie by omission... or say nothing about the thing you need to lie about. * Maintain eye contact, but do not stare. This is a hard one. The best way to achieve it is to look at their left eye for a while then shift to their right eye. Obviously this is not possible if they are not facing you, and/or you are not facing them. Even if they are not facing you, try to face them when speaking to them. it helps to practice with your reflection in a mirror * You may be thrown for a loop (Greatly confused) by figures of speech, like the one I just used. Get a slang dictionary, and learn figures of speech. A web-search could also help. Treat figures of speech as their own words. * You may be clumsy or uncoordinated. In this case, practice makes perfect. Try doing artwork and other small lines and motion with your fingers, also try to throw a ball into the air and catch it. Dancing helps with your foot coordination and biking helps with your balance, as does roller blading. * Remember that Asperger's is a combined disorder. It often manifests with several other disorders. Below are some of them * You may have trouble with math, reading, writing or communication * If you have trouble writing, try to type everything important. Type all assignments and letters, then print them off. Avoid writing things. If it cannot be typed try to get someone else to help you write it. If that cannot be done try to do it yourself. In a classroom situation ask the teacher or professor permission to bring your laptop into class to take notes, or ask for some form of keyboard or electronic note-taking system. If that doesn't work try to meet with a psychologist or psychiatrist. Find out if you really need it. If you do need it, then get classified as Dysgraphic. The school will now make concessions such as allowing you to use your laptop in class as per the ADA (American Disabilities Act). If they let you use the laptop or writing device you do not need to get officially classified (You might want to anyways so you can use it for the essay section of the ACT or SAT). Do not abuse the privilege of having the laptop, use it only for note taking. If you cannot get officially classified as dysgraphic then try to get a friend or relative in the same class as you to share their notes. Or just try to deal with it. Note taking is important. * If you have trouble with math then don't worry to much, calculators exist for a reason. You might find that even though you can't add or subtract, or multiply easily, you can still do more complicated stuff, like working with formulas, or geometry. Do not give up hope. If you still have trouble consult your psychologist or psychiatrist. They will be able to help you better then I am able. * If you have trouble reading try to figure out how bad it is. You might just have to breakthrough, and read a lot for a long period of time until you get good at it. Otherwise find some tips for dealing with dyslexia, and consult your psychologist or psychiatrist. * You may experience sensory overloads. * If you have trouble with loud noises, to the point that it hurts your ability to participate in a class or at work tell someone in charge. Get permission to wear sound mufflers at work or in class. Shooter's earmuffs help a great deal because you can still hear normal noises, but loud noises are filtered out. This will set you apart from other people, and make you seem odd though, so think carefully if you really need it. * If light bothers you, get sunglasses; if certain colors bother you, get them tinted to the opposite of the color so that it appears black or grey in your vision (Red-Green, Yellow-Cyan, Blue-Magenta). Sunglasses are also often considered ""cool"" which means that they are usually acceptable. * If you have problems with touch get soft comfortable clothes, and wear your less comfortable work clothes (Or suit, or whatever) over them. * If you only like certain foods pack them and bring them with you to lunches/dinners. If people ask why just explain that you have special dietary requirements. * If you have troubles with smells find a perfume, preferably a more floral-type scent or extract (like lemon, vanilla or almond extract) that you like the smell of and a dab it under your nose. It should overcome other scents. * You may have symptoms similar to (or even have as well) ADD, ADHD, OCD, or OCPD. Here are some ways with dealing with these: * If you have ADD- or ADHD-like symptoms you will probably be easily excitable, quickly bored, and have trouble focusing on the task at hand. Sometimes the only solution in sight is pills, but you can occasionally overcome these yourself. * If you have OCD or OCPD like traits you will tend to obsess over things, and have special patterns and methods that must be followed or you start feeling upset. It may hamper your ability to share a space with someone, or the obsessive thoughts may disturb you, or make you behave oddly. * It's easy to get depressed when you have AS. This is because you don't have a good network of friends to help with your depression. The best solution for depression is to do something, or change some aspect of your life. If that fails or is impossible try to get into a mantra of living in the now, so that if you are depressed it won't last long. Or try to make friends so you have a support network. If all else fails or is for some reason impossible there is still Prozac and other such pills. * If you feel depressed that you have Asperger's, think about this. Vernon Smith, a Nobel prize-winning economist, has it. Craig Nicholls, the frontman of a band called The Vines has it. Satoshi Tajiri, the person that invented Pokemon, also has it. Albert Einstein probably had it. Issac Newton probably had it. People think that Stanley Kubric might have had it. You can still live a successful life, get married, have kids, and get famous and/or rich if you have Asperger's. On the other hand, you still have similar odds as other people do in failing to be successful, failing to get married, failing to be famous, and failing to be rich. * Communication takes place in several forms, and at every level. * The most obvious level is the spoken or written word. This is fairly easy to master, but is one of the least important forms. A simple dictionary can help, as can a slang dictionary. * The second, and most obfuscated level for someone with Aspergers is the emotional and mental level built around the non-verbal cues... Position of lips, position of eye-lids, posture, tone of voice, volume of voice, where eyes are focused, and hand gestures are some of the more important parts to look at, but every piece of the human body is telling a story, and it's really impossible to read it all at once, even for a ""neuro-normal""."	.

Create a preliminary outline. Before you begin to publish a final copy, you will want to practice writing exactly what you want to say in the brochure. This is a great time to check spelling, grammar, and punctuation. * First you want to create a story. Just like a good novel pulls in a reader, the client wants to feel as if he or she is going on an adventure. In paragraph form (full sentences) write a convincing argument for why the vacation spot is the best place to visit. * After you have written down your argument, go back and check for edits. More importantly, cross out extraneous information, keep what is critical, and add in to places that need a more exciting, or convincing argument. * This argument can then be split apart into different sections of your brochure. You might have to tailor the sentences to exist as a stand-alone argument in the different sections, but this will give you a good head start. It is important that the writer knows exactly why each of the individual pieces are critical, and how they come together to convince the clientele. 2. Use specialized fonts and lettering. The brochure should be legible, and easy to follow. There should be an overall flow to the brochure, and not feel discombobulated. * Your heading/title should appear in bold lettering, underlined, and be large enough to read from far away (see 2.3). If someone is sitting in a doctors office, or at a coffee shop, they should be able to see the title clearly, at the top of the brochure. * Each of the subheadings/section headings should also be in bold, and underlined. They should be a slightly smaller font size than the title. They should all also all be the same font. If one subtitle is in Times New Roman, keep them all Times New Roman. This creates a nice flow to your brochure, and does not bog down the viewer in trying to comprehend the brochure. 3. Write a captivating title. Simple tag lines like ""Mexican Vacation"" or ""Hawaiian Vacation"" are going to bore the potential vacationers and not draw them in to read the rest of the brochure. You need to use descriptive adjectives, possibly even verbs, to entice the viewer. * Write down some adjectives you know that are not typically used, such as adventurous, pulsating, mind-boggling, fanciful, breathtaking, etc. Put these words first in your title, so that the readers eyes, reading left to right, will catch that key word. * Then make sure to include the location in the title. If you advertising for a Hawaiian vacation, do not leave out the word Hawaii. Put the location right after the adjective. * Following the name of the place, you can finish the title with simply ""vacation"" or a synonym. End the title in an exclamation point, so that it appears that the person selling the vacation is just as excited as the potential clientele. *"	Example: Adventurous Mount Everest Vacation!

Most men’s casual shoes are already flat, so just make sure you pick up a pair with a thinner sole.center * Most women’s flats lack sole support, so if you are going to wear flats, make sure to either use a padded insole or make sure you aren’t going to be walking or standing for long periods of time. *	.

Reduce your housing costs. If your rent is more than you can afford right now, consider moving to a cheaper part of town. Research apartments in another building or area of the city that is cheaper than what you pay now. Even a savings of a few hundred dollars a month can make a big impact on your budget and allow you to spend that money on other necessities or expenses. * Consider moving to a rural area. Often, rural areas outside of a bigger city or town means cheaper rent and living. There are also states in the U.S. with a lower cost of living, so perhaps a bigger move, to another state, might be an option for you. * Don’t rush to move to a new city or state without a safety net like a job or a family member you can live with until you get on your feet. The benefits of a cheaper cost of living may not matter if you are in a new environment with no income. 2. Get a roommate. In most cities and towns, finding affordable housing can be a nightmare. There may be subsidized housing available, but it will likely come with a long waiting list. So the next best thing to cheap rent is someone to share the cost of rent, as well as your utilities. * If you live in a house, consider renting out an extra room, or the basement. * Always do a background check and a references check on any potential roommates. You want to be sure you are not letting anyone dangerous or shady into your home. You will be dependant on your roommate to come up with rent every month, so make sure they can afford to live with you before you agree to be their roommate. 3. Rethink your child care. Most professional child care is very expensive. If you have two income earners in your house, you may in fact save money if one adult stays home with the little ones. This will eliminate daycare fees, and other expenses like gas and take out meals. * Another option may be a family member or trusted family friend you can pay an affordable rate to watch your kids while you’re at work. This will likely be less than professional child care and also foster a closer relationship between your kids and your immediate family. 4. Visit your local food bank or soup kitchen, and use food stamps. Search for your local food bank online and get a free hot meal. Your local soup kitchen is also a great place to get a free hot meal and save your minimum wage for your rent or other necessary expenses. * Food stamps, also known as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) in the U.S. is a government run program that provides funds for food. Eligibility is based on your income and the benefits provided by the state you live in. * Most individuals who live on minimum wage qualify for food stamps. Depending on your eligibility and the amount of people in your household, you can receive $150 - $300 a month in food benefits.	.

Brown, tan, or white are common dog colors, but don’t hesitate to choose something more unconventional for your origami creation. * If you don’t have origami paper, use something else that is thin and easy to fold, like newspaper, magazine pages, or even wrapping paper. Just make sure to cut the substitute into the right dimensions so you have a perfectly square piece of paper. 2. Fold the square of paper in half to create a triangle. Take the top-left corner and fold it across so it meets the bottom-right corner, forming a triangle shape. Run your finger along the fold to create a crease. * Using the back of your nail or something hard, like the body of a pen, can help make your crease lines more defined. 3. Open the square back up and fold it in half diagonally the other way. Unfold the paper so it is a square again.	Press down along the fold line to make another crease.

After *felting your old wool sweater, lay it out flat. With yarn and a tapestry needle, stitch the seamed edge of the sleeve to the side of the sweater, about half way down the sleeve from where the armpit meets the side seam. (I used contrasting yarn to make the stitches more visible.) 2. Fold the bottom edge of the sweater up and place the sleeve in front of it. You want to roll (or fold) the bottom up far enough that both sleeve cuff edges will be able to overlap slightly when place in front of it. 3. Secure the sleeve to the top of the rolled up sweater edge with a whip stitch or a blanket stitch. Remember that you’re going to stuff the sleeves, so be sure to stitch only through the top layer of the sleeve. 4. Repeat with the other sleeve. As the cuffs overlap slightly in front, put one cuff just inside of the other and stitch down the outside cuff edge along the top layer, just enough that you’ll be able to keep the stuffing inside the tube you’ve just created with the sleeves. 5. Now make a running stitch from one “armpit” to the other. Create an arched shape to make a rounder bed. Be sure to go through both layers of sweater fabric. You should now have a “channel” that can be stuffed with batting or old rags (or strips of old sweaters). Stuff until you get a sausage-like ring. If you want to pad the bottom, now is the time to do that as well. 6.	Give to your favorite kitty/puppy and consider making another to donate to your local pet shelter. It took more time to post this than to make the bed if that tells you how quick and easy this project is!

Bumpy dry skin won't do, after you take a shower always put lotion on, you can't really prevent bumpy red skin(unless it's acne) But always moisturize your skin 3 times a day. 2. Remember, by now you probably want to know how to get the perfect manicure and pedicure. * Fix your nails. * File them with a nail filer. * Trim them. * Find some lotion of any kind and massage some on your nails. * Get vasaline and massage some on your nails. * Soak your fingers in lemon juice mixed with a little bit of warm water. * Choose a nail color, the colors that are in are Hot pink, Black, Dark purple, dark or light red, and finally dark blue and green. 3. Do your hair! * Hair Style. 4. It depends on the length. Let's start with short, cute bobs. If you are thinking on getting a bob or already have one, here is a perfect style. First take a shower, then ruffle your hair and apply hairspray for a dangerous, sexy look. If you want a more sassy look, take a shower and comb your hair straight but at the ends of your hair, curve it."	Medium hair: medium hair is the bomb! A cute style is to get or a buy a small curling iron. Let it heat up, then curl it, but not just any curl: a spiral twist. To do this, you have to twist your hand a bit to the right or left and apply hairspray. Now, finally, long, dangerous hair. Long hair is the secret to excellence. The hottest styles are wavy and spiral twist. A fast and simple way to wavy hair is braids, before you go to bed simply do 2 braids, or one, or 2 French braids, or ALL OVER. The easiest way to get a spiral twist is to do the same as for medium.

Combine the powdered sugar, salt, and powdered milk. Add the three ingredients to medium to large bowl and stir or whisk them together until evenly distributed. Set it to the side as you prepare the syrup. 2. Combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup, and butter. Add the three ingredients to a medium pot and stir together. To combine the ingredients thoroughly, you will need to heat them. Heat the syrup over medium-high to high heat, stirring constantly, until it comes to a boil. 3. Reduce the heat. After the syrup begins to boil, reduce the heat to medium and continue stirring for roughly five minutes. * You may want to use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature of the candy as it cooks. Clip the thermometer to the side of the pot, positioning it so that the tip does not touch the bottom of the pan but dips into the liquid candy. The temperature at this point should be about 230 degrees Fahrenheit (110 degrees Celsius). 4. Remove the candy and add the vanilla. Remove the pot from the heat and pour in the vanilla extract. Stir the candy thoroughly using a heat-resistant, non-stick spatula, such as a silicone spatula, until it appears blended. 5. Add the dry ingredients. Dump the powdered sugar, powdered milk, and salt mixture into the liquid candy. Use the same heat-resistant, non-stick spatula to rapidly stir the two mixtures together until the dry ingredients have been completely blended into the wet. The new mixture should be smooth and should not have any visible clumps. 6. Pour the candy into a pan to cool slightly. Line a standard half-sheet size baking pan with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Pour the candy into the pan, scraping the sides of the pot with your spatula to remove the sticky candy clinging to the side. Allow the candy to cool for roughly 15 minutes, or until it is cool enough for you to handle without burning yourself. You do not want it to cool completely, though. 7. Divide the dough into three parts. At this point, the candy should be solid enough to be the consistency of dough. Separate the candy into three equal parts so that you can create the three distinct layers for your candy corn. Place each piece of dough into a different bowl. 8. Color the candy. Add 2 to 3 drops of yellow food coloring to one bowl and 2 to 3 drops of orange food coloring to another bowl. Leave one bowl of dough uncolored. Knead the dough that needs to be colored until the color is distributed evenly throughout the entire piece. There should be no streaking. * You may want to wear disposable plastic gloves to prevent your hands from getting stained. Do not wear the same pair of gloves to knead each colored batch.	If you do not wear gloves, wash your hands after kneading the first color and before working on the second.

Gather your materials: a file folder, a ruler, scissors, scotch tape, and a pen. These items can be easily found in business offices. * A file folder is a perfect medium to hold and fold paper. If you don’t have a file folder, try to avoid using material that’s not too flimsy or too hard. It is more difficult to create precise folds with materials like cardboard. 2. Using a ruler, draw a rectangle on the file folder. Outline the dimensions 8.525″ x 11.025″. We recommend using these dimensions for folding printing paper (standard printing paper dimensions are 8.5″ x 11″). It is important for the brochure dimensions to be slightly bigger to avoid adding too much pressure on the triangular folds in step 5. 3. Measure and label the panel divisions. Use the dimensions 3.5″ for panel A, 4″ for panel B, and 3.525″ for panel C. It is important for panel B to be wider than the side panels to avoid overlapping the folds. Also, we recommend to take advantage of the crease on the file folder – because there’s already a pre-developed fold, we used the crease as a division between panels A and B. 4. Cut out the rectangle once the measurements are done. Use the outline of the rectangle that you drew in Step 2 as a guideline. Do not throw away the file folder scraps yet! Use the remains for step 5 to create your pocket folds. 5. Trace out four triangular folds, and cut them out. Use the remaining folder scraps to create the brochure folds. One way to draw them is by placing the scraps over the brochure corners to outline the fold edges. The best way to maintain straight lines is by using a ruler. If tracing is an issue, we recommend to use the dimensions: 1″ x 1″ x 1.5″. 6. Tape the folds on each corner of the tri-folder. The hypotenuse side of each triangular fold should face the inside of the tri-folder. Also, make sure to only tape on the edges of the brochure, not on the inside. These triangular folds will be used to insert and keep the paper in place. Make sure to use enough tape to avoid scabbing the paper in the sockets. 7.	Voila!

Clean and dry the bottle, pick a cork that wasn't drilled through during removal, then roll up your document, put it into the bottle and seal it with the cork. 3. Attach your finders string. You want the capsule to be found eventually, so find some plastic string (string trimmer line works well) and wrap it tightly around the top of the bottle to create a lead. Plastic can be degraded by sunlight and pounding surf, but underground it lasts almost indefinitely. 4. Dig a hole. Get the capsule below the frost line - that usually means going down a couple feet. If the annual freeze and thaw of the ground in winter reaches your capsule it will be heaved to the surface or broken in a few years. A shovel works, but a post hole digger can finish the job in ten minutes. 5. Give some thought to where you put the capsule; back yards away from potential utility company digging are better than high traffic areas that might see a gas line or telephone pole installed. 6. Fill it in and mark the location.' Spool the finders line into the hole as you fill it in leaving just a trace above ground. Also, as you fill in the dirt, toss a few pennies or your countries cheap coin equivalent into the hole ever few inches.

Limit your daily intake of carbohydrates. Your pancreas produces the most insulin when you consume a carbohydrate rich meal. This is bad, especially when you're aiming to lose abdominal fat. Controlling the amount and type of carbohydrates you eat throughout the day can help you manage your insulin levels. * Carbohydrates are found in the following foods: grains, starchy vegetables, legumes, fruits and dairy products. They are also found in sweets and sweetened beverages. * Carbohydrates are found in a wide variety of food groups. Because they are so wide spread, it's not realistic or healthy to completely avoid carbohydrates. * There is no right or wrong diet style when it comes to limiting your carbohydrates. You may choose to follow a diabetic diet, a low-carb diet or come up with your own specific diet plan to help manage your carbohydrate intake and insulin levels. 2. Consume moderate amounts of grains. Foods like bread, rice or pasta are significantly higher in carbohydrates compared to other food groups. Although these foods are considered a healthy part of a balanced diet, they will raise your blood sugar and insulin levels quicker and higher than other food groups. * Limit your consumption of grain based foods. You do not have to completely avoid them, but it may be ideal to limit yourself to only 1-2 servings daily. * One serving of grains is about 1 ounce or 1/2 cup. * When you're choosing to eat grains, try to choose 100% whole grains. These are higher in fiber and other nutrients that can support a healthy diet. * Whole grain foods include: quinoa, barley, brown rice or 100% whole wheat bread. 3. Increase your daily intake of fiber. Fiber is typically found in more complex carbohydrates. These are carbohydrates that digest slowly and release blood sugar or glucose into your blood stream more slowly. This helps prevent a spike in insulin. * Foods that are high in fiber include: beans, lentils, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. * In general, women need about 25 g of fiber daily and men need about 38 g of fiber daily. Aiming to meet these minimums can help you manage your insulin levels more efficiently. * Try to include a fiber rich food at each meal and snack. This will help you manage insulin levels throughout the entire day. 4. Eat healthy fats. Healthy fats, like omega-3 fats, not only support a healthy heart, but also slow the digestion of food like carbohydrates. Including healthy fats throughout your day can help slow the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates and manage insulin levels. * Healthy fats are found in a variety of foods including: olive oil, fatty fish, avocados, nuts and seeds. * Include 1-2 servings of healthy fats daily. One teaspoon of oils, 3-4 ounces of fish, 1/4 cup of nuts or seeds and 1/2 cup of avocado counts as a serving. 5. Avoid or limit simple carbohydrates. Some foods cause a quick spike or rise in blood sugar and insulin levels. Simple carbohydrates are known to be low in fiber and include: sweetened beverages, sweets or desserts, refined grain products (like white rice) and foods made from white flour (like white bread). * Instead of drinking sugary, sweet beverages, stick to no or low calories beverages. Try: water, flavored water, decaf coffee or tea. * It's most likely unrealistic to completely give up sweets and desserts. Limit them in your diet and stick to smaller portions. * Also limit refined grain products. These are not only low in fiber, but also low in a variety of other healthy nutrients. Try to choose 100% whole grain as often as possible. 6. Eat well-balanced meals. You may be inclined to follow a low-carb diet and minimize your consumption of foods like grains, starchy vegetables or fruits to help control insulin levels.	.

Check that the damper is open. The damper is a device that controls the amount of air flowing through the flue. The flue is the passage or duct for smoke in a chimney. Feel inside the chimney or pop your head inside to look at the damper with a flashlight. There should be a lever which you can try moving one way or the other. One direction will close the damper, the other will open it - check to see that the damper is open, or else smoke will pour back into the room. This is much easier to do before lighting a fire in there. Once you have determined that the damper is open, you are ready to get started. 2. If your fireplace has glass doors, open the doors 30 minutes before to allow the inside of the fireplace to come to room temperature. Cold air is heavier than warm air, so if the outside is too cold, it can create a river of cold air flowing down the chimney, into the fireplace, and trapped there by the doors. By opening the doors and allowing some warm air from your room to rise up the chimney, it may be enough to start the draft moving upwards. 3. Check the draft. Light a match near the opening of the flue and see if the draft is coming down or going up. If it is still coming down, you must find a way of reversing the draft and getting it to go up. Under no circumstances can you light the fire with the draft coming down. One method is to use a starter block (StarterLogg is one brand -- break off a quarter of a stick) or a commercial wax log (such as Duraflame or Pine Mountain). These will light and stay lit, creating some warmth inside the firebox and helping the draft start upwards, and they burn with little smoke: 1. Close the damper (to stop the air from coming down). 2. Put the block on the back of the fireplace shovel, light it and place it up inside the fireplace near the flue opening. What you are trying to do is to heat the upper part of the fireplace. 3. When you have heated it (you will need to use trial and error to determine how long this process is) slowly open the damper and with luck and skill you will find that the heat and fire from your little block will force the air up the chimney. When the draft has fully reversed (you will hear the air sucking the fire and heat from the starter block), then you can light your fire. 4. Set up your wood and kindling. * Put the kindling on the grate first, with crumpled up newspaper under the grate and mixed in the kindling. Stack your wood on top.  * Tinder (in this case, the newspaper) and kindling are materials used to start a fire. Tinder is little bitty stuff like dry grass or straw, tiny twigs, newspaper and the like. Kindling is a little bigger - branches that are thin as your finger, wood shavings, small bits of wood or bark (too small to be logs or to be stacked). Tinder gets lit first and burns very fast - the key is to get enough tinder under the kindling so that the kindling begins to burn. Once the kindling is burning, it should burn long enough to light the logs stacked on top. * Don't use too much newspaper, as it produces a lot of smoke. * Be sure to stack the wood horizontally (lay it down, don't stand it up on end) and leave gaps for air to pass through (create draft). * Stack it in layers, criss-crossed. * Intersperse some kindling with the larger wood. At first, the wood should be no thicker than your forearm. Using slightly smaller wood to start will burn quicker and make a good bed of embers for later on. * Stack the wood at most to 2/3 of the height of the fireplace. 5. Light the newspaper first. The kindling lights from that. Watch the smoke carefully for the first half hour. The smoke should be nearly undetectable if it's drafting right up the chimney.  * If the smoke from the chimney turns black, the fire is not getting enough oxygen. Use your fireplace poker to lift the wood stack carefully - just pry it up a little, like jacking up a car. Take care here - all you need to do is allow some air to get under it. If your bed of coals underneath the grate is too high, use the poker to spread them out under the fire, leaving a couple of inches of air space. * If the smoke is grey, most of the combustible material is escaping through the chimney instead of burning. * You probably did not light the fire from above. * You may have used wet wood. * The fire is getting too much oxygen. Yes, this is confusing - fire is a delicate balance of air and fuel. When there's too much oxygen, the fire has a hard time catching hold of the fuel, and can make more smoke than normal. 6. Open a window slightly. If you're still having trouble getting a good draft on the fireplace, and smoke is coming back into the room, try opening a window about an inch. This works best if the window is on a wall opposite the fireplace, with few obstructions - you will not want to have people seated between the window and fireplace. Sometimes, this breaks a kind of ""vapor lock"" on the room and allows the smoke to rise up the chimney. If people are between the fireplace and window, they will be chilled because the fireplace will start to suck air up - and it'll start pulling hard from that window, which will create a stream of cold air running between the window and fireplace. Stay out of the way and let it go - sometimes if the chimney isn't tall enough, this is the only way to get the draft running well and keep smoke out of the room. The rest of the room should stay warm, it's just the draft path that will be chilly. 7. Add really big logs. If you're trying to enjoy an evening, you can make sure the fire will go a while without tending by building it properly to start with. Once the fire is going well, you should begin to see some red, glowing embers beneath the fire. As the smaller wood catches and the fire burns hot, grab a larger piece of wood - big. Like, as big around as your thigh, this time (assuming your thigh is a normal sized thigh). Put that on top of the fire carefully, being as certain as possible that the stack is not leaning side to side any direction. The bigger wood takes a while to catch fire, but once it does, it will burn a long time without you having to get up and stir it or move it around. The glowing embers will keep things hot, and you should be nice and toasty for a couple of hours this way. 8. Stir the wood down at least half an hour before you want it to go out. Break it up with your poker and try to spread it out as much as you can over the area of the firebox. The thinner it's spread, the quicker it will burn up and go out. Check after the fire is out to insure that the coals and embers are all dead. If so, close the damper so that you do not lose valuable home heat through the chimney all day long. 9. Alternative method (guaranteed to burn and keep the fire for a long time) Remove the grid and never use it again: it only keeps the hot embers from heating the floor of the fireplace. Put two large logs (the bigger the better) in parallel about 15 inches apart, perpendicular to the pane of the closed glass doors, or fireplace opening. These large logs will be the bed of the fire and contain the embers to feed it."	This cross-log will hold the other firewood and keep a 'window' open where the fire can draw fresh air to feed it from underneath. Then crumple newspapers (not glossy paper!) on the bottom of the fireplace, place the kindle on top. Do not put any larger logs or fuel on top yet. Light the fire. Make sure that the kindle starts to burn - you need to hear crackling noise. Then place some logs (about the half in diameter than your forearm) in between the large logs, parallel with them, on top of the cross log. Keep this arrangement at all times: two logs, one cross-log on top and firewood held by the cross-log.

Reduce the financial problems of being fired. * Increase your employable to make it easier by keeping your personal and professional skills up to date and cultivating a good network. * Keep your private expenses as low as you possibly can, so that you’re not 100% dependent on that pay check every month. That means not eating out or going to the movies for awhile. You may even have to give up smoking. That however would be the best thing that could come out of being fired. 7. Explain being fired to next employer that you were fired is always a concern. If you believe that being fired is embarrassing and that it reflects badly on you, it will come out in in your job interviews. Hold your head up high and explain the cirumstances exactly and why you’re not ashamed will help convey the impression that “Yeah, you were fired, so what!” Some employers will care, some won’t - provided you explain it correctly. 8. Many people feel a deep shame at being fired and at being unemployed.	But why not? Why must being fired or being unemployed be so darned embarrassing? It doesn’t need to be! You decide for yourself whether you need to be ashamed or not! Don’t let others force shame upon you, if you have nothing to be ashamed of.

Think about the people who might call you fat. * If they are fat themselves, just find a way to say that they are also fat. Come back with something that says they are a hypocrite (for example, ""Pot calling the kettle black""). If this person is larger than you, feel free to point out how much bigger they are than you and make them regret calling you ""fat""! * If they are skinny, say something like ""I'd rather be fat than stupid"". Avoid directly calling them ""fat"" or ""fatso"", as they will only point out that you are fatter than them. Call them a hypocrite instead, or mention how their ego, personality complex, or some other intangible negative trait of theirs is so much larger than you will ever be (For example, (If the person insulted you by saying you can't fit through the bathroom door) ""I don't see how you can fit through with your ego the size of a small country!"". 2. Sometimes the best comeback is one towards the others immaturity, a simple laugh will suffice. 3. Look up some good responses on the Internet. 4. Play it cool and casual. You know you're beautiful, and that's what counts! 5. Say something like ""What makes you so perfect?"" And when they try to talk again, keep saying it. Then they can't say anything to hurt you, and give up! 6."	This makes it obvious their words hurt you. (And all mean words do.

Measure a distance that is too long for a bar scale. Determine if the distance between your two tick marks is too long to match up to the bar scale. In this case, you can either take several measurements with the bar scale to get the total, or use a ruler or tape measure instead. * To use the bar scale for a longer measurement, place your right tick mark on the farthest number on the primary scale. Make another mark on your paper where the extension scale ends on the left, and note this distance. Use your new mark as your right tick mark and measure using the bar scale as normal. Add this to your previous number to get the total distance. * If you are measuring the distance between your tick marks or two points on a map using a ruler that is not long enough, try a tape measure for more length. 2. Measure a curved line with straight line segments. Determine if the route you want to measure has multiple points or takes the shape of a curve rather than a straight line. In this case, take multiple straight line measurements and add them together. * Use a straight-edged piece of paper as usual to mark the distance on the map. Instead of marking straight from point A to point B, measure several straight lines along the curved routes and add them together. Or, keep pivoting the piece of paper from the previous tick mark to make a series of straight line tick marks, then measure from the first and last one on the bar scale. * For the greatest accuracy, measure a greater number of smaller straight lines along a curved route. 3. Calculate distance to a point off the map. Determine if your map indicates the distance from the edge of the map to another popular destination not shown—like a town, highway or junction. Add this distance to a straight line measurement from your other point to the edge of the map. * First measure the distance between your point A to the edge of the map, using a straight edge piece of paper or a ruler as normal.	.

If you want to get started use this link: quicklink.to/makemoney 2. Work for someone else. Advertise your availability to the neighborhood. Make up some flyers and stick them to the neighbor's front door, but don't be intrusive. You shouldn't demand that they let you work for them. You won't get good business if you do that. Always have a smile! 3. right|180pxDo extra chores for your parents, such as dusting furniture, vacuuming, sweeping floors, or scrubbing windows. Negotiate the best deal you can, maybe one fourth what they might charge for professional service. Remember, these are extra chores on top of what you should normally do to help support a clean household. 4. Teach someone how to use a computer.

Sell unwanted items, or make items especially for selling. * Set-up a bake sale. Have your parents help you cook! * Take your unwanted clothes to a consignment shop. Make sure they're clean and in good condition. * If you have been collecting LEGOs or action figures and don't play with them anymore, sell them on websites such as eBay. Make sure you get your parents help and that you know what they're worth. Set a reasonable price and be honest about the condition. For example, if your toy doesn't have a scratch on it, you can say it is in good condition. However if it has bite marks on it, don't set it to good condition. If your toy hasn't even been opened yet, do not open it: collectors pay even more money for them if they are New In Box. 14. Recycle! - Cans and newspapers are recyclable! Ask your parents if they would help you to bring unclaimed recyclables to the nearest recycling plant and give you the money. Not only is this good for the environment, it's also good for your piggy bank! 15. Shovel snow off of neighbor's driveways, but be careful that you don't slip on the ice and that you have proper equipment. You can do the same in the Fall too! Rake leaves for fellow neighbors. 16. Use your strengths. If you are a very good artist, offer to do some portraits for people you know, or sell your artwork. 17. House-sit for a neighbor when they're on vacation. Just water their plants and clean. It's fun and profitable. 18. Save all of your birthday money! 19.  Don't spend all of your money on candy and treats. The small things really add up! 20. Make dog treats and sell them.	Don't try to make them on your own.

Host a yard sale to get rid of things you don’t want anymore. Clean out your room and gather up all of the toys, decor, and random knick-knacks that you no longer use or want. Clothes that are too small or that you don’t wear anymore are also great for selling. Display your items on a folding table in your yard or driveway. Put prices on each piece with a sticker label based on what you think it’s worth and the original price of the item. To increase the number of people at your sale, post signs around the neighborhood stating the location and hours of your yard sale 1 week before the event.center * The best time to throw a yard sale is on the weekends in the morning. That’s when most people who shop yard sales are out and about. * Ask your parents and siblings if they have anything they want to get rid of, too. If you have more variety of items at your sale, you’ll attract people of all ages. And the more people that visit, the more money you’ll make. * Be willing to negotiate prices. One of the best things about yard sales is finding deals, and people expect to be able to negotiate down some prices. Know ahead of time what the lowest price you’ll accept for different items is and stick to it when they start trying to bargain with you. 2. Sell candy to your neighbors or other kids at school at a higher price. Who doesn’t love an afternoon pick-me-up in the form of a chocolate bar? Buy candy in bulk at a warehouse store like Sam’s Club or Costco where it’s much cheaper. Then, resell the individual candy bars or packs for a profit by doubling the price. For example, if you bought 12 candy bars for $12, you paid $1 per bar. Sell them at a price of $2 and you’ll pocket $12 after deducting the original cost.center * If you’re planning to sell the candy at school or on the bus, check your school rules to make sure that’s allowed. Some schools may forbid students selling things to other students without permission. * Bring a parent with you if you decide to go door-to-door to stay safe. 3. Run a lemonade stand when it’s hot outside. You’ll need a folding table, a sign that says “Lemonade For Sale!”, plastic cups, straws, a large pitcher, ice, and, of course, lemonade. If you’re setting up your stand in the front yard, make your lemonade in the kitchen and keep it refrigerated. Then bring it outside in batches as you run out so it stays cool. If your stand is farther from your house, make the lemonade ahead of time and store it in a cooler underneath your table. Sell the lemonade per cup. Charge extra for ice and a straw (using more materials means a higher cost!).center * While you can use bottled lemonade, you won’t be able to charge as much as if you make your own. People will pay more for hand-squeezed lemonade that they can’t buy themselves at the store. * Selling snacks like pretzels or cookies along with the lemonade is a good way to make some extra money. 4. Throw a bake sale with cookies, cupcakes, and other baked goods. Put on your apron and start baking. Choose classic recipes that are easy to make in big batches like chewy chocolate chip cookies, fudgy brownies, or vanilla cupcakes. Once you bake everything, separate your goodies into individual servings and place them in pretty packages like treat bags tied with ribbons. Set up a stand in your front yard or out on the street corner to get more traffic.center * Food safety and cleanliness is very important when you’re selling homemade food. Always wash your hands with soap and water before you bake or handle food and make sure you’re using the freshest ingredients. * Contact your public health department or local government to find out if you need any special permits to sell your baked goods. There are often requirements for selling food that’s made in someone’s home but sometimes there are exceptions for small bake sales. * Use boxed mixes or make your recipes from scratch. Another option is to specialize in a certain type of food, like gluten-free or vegan baked goods, to make your bake sale unique. 5. Grow plants, herbs, or vegetables to sell. Start your own mini farmer’s market by first choosing what plants you want to grow. If your parents let you plant your own garden in the backyard, opt for easy-to-grow vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes, or cucumbers. If you will be growing your plants inside in pots, pick ones that don’t require a lot of sunlight or space. Pick your vegetables when they’re ripe and sell them in bags or plastic containers. If you’re growing flowers or herbs, consider selling the entire potted plant so the buyer can continue to enjoy it for years to come.center * Herbs like basil, oregano, and chives grow well indoors. Other good houseplants include succulents, ferns, and spider plants. * The best time to start planting will vary based on where you live and the climate.	Google your specific plant or ask the local nursery if you aren’t sure.

Try to not be on a phone, TV, tablet, computer etc. an hour before bed, screens stimulate your brain, making it harder to fall asleep. Don't exercise right before bed. You might think it will make you tired, but your heart is beating and you are in ""get-up and go mode"" instead of ""fall asleep mode"". Exercise in the morning instead."	.

Get or make a still. Vodka is a distilled, highly refined product. It is usually distilled with a column still, but pot stills can also be used. Column stills produce purer alcohol because they essentially redistill the alcohol in a single pass, and therefore further purification with a carbon filter may not be needed. The distilled vodka can be redistilled additional times to produce a very pure product. Pot stills produce a crude product that contains flavor and aroma compounds that will need to be removed by treatment with a carbon filter and/or by additional distillations. * Column stills can be purchased or built using readily available materials, but are somewhat more complex and sophisticated than pot stills. It is important to understand that cooling water is usually circulated through a compartment in the distillation column, causing the vaporized alcohol and other substances to condense. This means that such a still must be attached directly to a faucet or a motorized pump to move water from a supply into the still must be used. If not recirculating water from a single supply, thousands of gallons of water may be used to make a small batch of vodka. If water is recirculated from a central reservoir using a pump, about fifty gallons of water can be used, but the water will heat up and become less effective. See Sources and Citations below for detailed, high-quality instructions for the construction and use of column stills. * Simple pot stills only require that a single, stationary vessel of cooling water be used. The cooling water can be added to or replenished with fresh cold water with a hose or even by dumping in more water with a bucket. This is due to the design of such stills. Unlike column stills that are essentially vertical columns, pot stills may utilize bent tubing or piping that can be submersed horizontally in a vessel of water. See Sources and Citations below for detailed, high-quality instructions for the construction of pot stills. 2. Choose the medium to be distilled. Vodka is commonly made from wheat, rye, barley, corn, and potatoes. Sugar and molasses can also be used alone or added to other ingredients. Rogue distilling makes an innovative vodka from Pinot Noir red wine. Whatever you choose, it must be fermented by yeast and contain alcohol. When making vodka from grains and potatoes, a mash must be made that contains active enzymes that break down the starches from the grains or potatoes and makes fermentable sugars. Vodka made from store-bought sugars need only be fermented, thus bypassing the need for a mash. When already fermented mediums such as wine are used, the medium can be distilled right away into vodka. 3. Formulate a mash. A mash is necessary when using grains or other sources of starch such as grains and potatoes that need to be converted into fermentable sugars. There are some basic principles to consider: * Grains and potatoes are sources of starch. Starch must be broken down into sugars that can be fermented by yeast and converted into alcohol. * Malted grains such as malted barley and wheat are rich in natural enzymes that break down starches into fermentable sugars. The enzymes can act on the starch when the malted grains are cracked open with a mill and added to a certain amount of hot water that is held at a specific temperature for a certain amount of time. Milled, malted grains can be added to a starchy, enzyme-poor mash and the enzymes from the grain will break down the starches into sugars. * Food-grade amylase enzyme powder can be purchased from a homebrew shop and added to the mash to convert the starch into fermentable sugars. Use the recommended amount for the amount of starch to be broken down. There is no need to use malted, enzyme-rich grains such as malted barley or wheat when using enzyme powder. * For enzymes to be able to break down starches, even the starches of malted, enzyme-rich grain, the starches must first be gelatinized. Flaked (rolled) grains are an exception, as they are generally already gelatinized. Ungelatinized ingredients are heated in water to the gelatinization temperature of the particular starch that is used.	However, the gelatinization temperature of potatoes is actually about 150F, and barley and wheat gelatinize well at about the same temperature, so a potato mash may only need to be heated to 150F.

Stand in the center of your mat and separate the sides of the swing. From this position, you can begin to do some of the most basic aerial yoga moves, such as the aerial lunge. You should be standing close enough to the swing that your face touches or almost touches the fabric, and the bottom of the swing’s “U” should hit at pubic bone level. * If the swing hits higher or lower than your pubic bone, you should adjust it before mounting the swing. * The aerial lunge improves quad strength and stretches out your hip flexors. 2. Place your right leg inside the “U” of the hammock. In order to complete an aerial lunge, you need merely set your right leg into the hammock’s U and bend it so that the swing sits on the lower surface of your leg above the knee. The swing should support your right leg while your left one remains firmly planted on the mat. 3. Position your hands at hip level and lean forward. With your arms akimbo, you should lunge forward when inhaling. Keep your left leg planted as before and feel your left quad and hip stretch out. * Take care to lunge straight forward rather than leaning to either side. It might be difficult at first, but your balance will improve as you practice. 4. Rock back to starting position when exhaling. Once you’ve leaned forward into lunge position, you should exhale and apply pressure to the hammock with your right leg. This will push you back into the starting position so that you can repeat the aerial lunge again. * Once you’ve repeated this move several times, switch legs and do lunges with the left leg in the hammock. 5. Try out slightly more complicated moves, such as the half boat pose. Once you’ve got the basic aerial lunge down, you can move on to other fundamental and generally accessible poses. The half boat pose, for example, requires you to rest your lower back in the hammock, lean back, and lift your legs. Holding the pose for five seconds, you'll engage your core and eventually develop core strength and awareness. * Other basic aerial poses to try are the child’s pose and downward facing dog. For further guidance, check out a plethora of online video tutorials. 6. Focus on fine-tuning learned positions. Like regular yoga, you should strive to improve and perfect all the positions you’ve learned. Seemingly small details, such as foot or hand direction, leg extension, or pointed toes can make a huge difference to the benefit and sustainability of a position.	.

Buy clothes from the men's section. Ladies' pants are designed to accent curves (hips, butts, and thighs) which can easily give you away. Men's pants are cut straight, and they can hide some curves, including giving you a flatter butt. * If you're quite petite, you may want to buy from the women's section occasionally. * Trying brands specifically for trans people, like Point 5cc, is also a valid option. 2. Flatten your chest. Those with small chests might be able to get away with only a looser shirt. Those with larger chests will need to do more, such as wear tighter sports bras and looser shirts. You may also try binding, which is any way of flattening your chest, giving it a more masculine appearance. * There are multiple ways to bind. You can: * Use a binder. Binders typically come in tank top length and half-length, and are made out of special material that presses the breast tissue down without becoming too dangerous for you. Good brands include Underworks and GC2B. * Use a double sports bra method. * Never use tape or elastic (e.g. ACE) bandages to bind your chest down. Elastic bandages are often used (especially on TV) but these bandages were designed to compress tighter when stretched, i.e. they constrict every time you take a breath. This can sometimes lead to breathing problems, suffocation, broken or bruised ribs, or deformation of the rib cage. * Underworks recommends stepping into some of the longer binders that it sells. While this is the easiest way of putting them on, by forcing the binder up over your butt and hips, it stretches out the top- which is rather counterproductive! It would be better to learn how to put it on like a normal shirt. * The point of binding isn't to make your chest completely flat, but rather to simulate pectorals (""pecs""). This means that, when you put your binder on, you don't want to just push the breast tissue down to make it lie flat against your rib cage. The bottom half of your breasts is about where the curve of your pectoral muscles are and is as low as male chests should bulge. If you let your breasts fall much below that point, your chest will look awkward and may give you away. * The most important part of binding is to listen to your body. Some soreness or slight pain in the breast itself is normal, but if you have rib cage pain, trouble breathing, or any type of cold or respiratory illness (even ones unrelated to binding), remove the binder and don't bind until you feel 100% again. 3. Consider getting a short haircut. While some guys can sport super long hair, it's unlikely to be a good idea for you, since you want to look less feminine. However, if you love having long hair, you might be able to find a long hairstyle that works for you. * Some say barbers do a much better job of cutting hair short (and trimming short hair) than hairdressers, but others say that (for trans men especially) hairdressers are better stylists. If you don't like your first haircut, try a different person. * Though it might be tempting to grab a pair of scissors and do it yourself, this is almost certainly not your best option. Even if you happen to be experienced in cutting hair, it is very difficult to cut and shape your own hair. Shaping your hair is hard, and mistakes will be easy to spot. Get a professional to cut it, or at least an experienced friend, to ensure that you get the result you want. * While this change can go a long way for how you feel and helping you pass, it's also a dramatic, immediate change that your parents (if you still live with them) are sure to notice. Be careful if you aren't out and haven't discussed it with them yet. If you aren't out, you could always remind them of the hundreds of ladies with short hair or pixie cuts. 4. Pack. Packing refers to wearing something (whether a sock, soft packer, or hard packer, or any other object) that gives a phallus-like bulge. * You may also want to consider getting an STP or an STP packer. STP (stand to pee) devices are devices that help you pee while standing up. You can also find STP packers, which act as soft packs and STPs, and thus are the best ""fake penises"" out there. * Packers are not designed to be safe for sex. * Soft packs usually come in a couple of sizes, 3.5"" and 5.5"" being the most common. The average size of a flaccid penis is somewhere between 3.5-4.5"", and most people feel quite comfortable with the 3.5"" model. It's completely up to you which you prefer. Just remember that they won't accept it back after you've opened it. * Low-rise styled briefs are really good for packing because they're tighter and have a ""pouch"" built in for your stuff. A sock or soft pack stay really well in there. 5. Cultivate a deep voice. The only way to gain a naturally deep voice is to start on testosterone, but if you want to start sounding more masculine before then, you should try working on lowering your voice. Start off slowly, trying to lower you voice just a little bit every week or so. * Sing along with the radio by trying to sing male parts or a lower version of the female parts. * Practice daily for an hour or so. Remember, your vocal cords are muscles and need to be exercised and can get tired and strained. * Exercise: say ""bing-bong king-kong ding-dong"" in a low voice, stretching out the ""ng."" Repeat while making each word slightly lower than the last. Do this a few times. * After a week or two, once your vocal cords are stronger in the low range, tip your head back and do this exercise. * This is demonstrated on YouTube. The ""boom your voice"" video is very helpful. * Don't try to use this in public for a while. Your face will look strained before you get used to lowering your voice. You'll probably also sound like you have a cold for a while too because of the amount of concentration you're putting into your voice. * If you feel awkward talking to yourself, you could try recording books for Librivox, which is a site that helps turn public-domain books into audio books, so that anyone can access them for free. 6. Build muscle. Most cultures associate larger muscles with masculinity, which is why working out and lifting weights will do wonders to make you look more masculine. * It takes time to noticeably build muscles. Start a regular workout schedule, and don't worry when you don't see results right away. * Males tend to have larger shoulders and noticeably more muscular arms, so you want to focus there. Their torsos are usually straight, with narrower hips and a less-defined waist. Doing some intense ab work will help there. But also don't forget about your chest, back, and legs. You don't want to gain too much muscle unevenly. * Working out and eating well will improve your health and make you look more robust. You may also happen to lose some weight, which will give you less curves. * You could work out like a professional athlete, but if your diet is poor, results will be subpar. Make sure to eat a healthy, balanced diet. * Aim to lose body fat, not weight. Young children tend to have rounder cheeks because their bodies store fat, which prepares them for growth. When males hit puberty, much of that fat leaves and the muscles become developed, giving them squarer faces, while females retain most of that fat after puberty. Losing body fat will help make your face more angular. 7. Work on your mannerisms. Appearance isn't the only aspect of masculinity; attitude also matters. * Practice walking. Women tend to take up less space when they walk, with their feet close together as if walking on an invisible line, causing the hips to sway. Men tend to walk slightly on each side of that invisible line, giving them more of a straight, swaggering walk that accents their hips less and takes up more space. A lot of guys also put their hands somewhere (in their pockets, holding something, etc). * If you're having a hard time figuring this out, follow someone and imitate their walk. * Work on sitting. Again, women try to take up less space, perhaps crossing their legs, while men usually don't care how much space they take up. Leave your legs open and lean back more. If you do cross your legs, put your ankle on your knee, making a box shape. * Consider your stance. Men don't usually put their hands on their hips unless they're thinking. They also tend to cross their arms higher over their chests. Putting your hands in your pockets is always good. Some ladies stick their hip out and angle their foot, while masculine guys tend to stand straight and without their hips off to one side. * Hold conversations. Women tend to send more signals to show that they're listening: nodding, saying ""Uh huh,"" or ""Oh no,"" asking ""And then what happened?"" etc. Men do less of this, usually tilting their head or looking at the speaker to show they're paying attention. Their voices may also be more monotone, with less inflections. * Pay attention to your arms. Women tend to move their arms a lot more than men when walking, so try to keep your arms to your sides. Just avoid making your arms extremely stiff or you may look suspicious. * Try hanging out in a populated spot and watch guys of all ages and ""types"" and see how they interact. Get a feel for their mannerisms, and try to emulate them. You may find that you already do a lot of those things, but you probably still have a number of typically female characteristics you'll want to unlearn. 8. Consider shaving. Males will lose their peach fuzz during puberty, while females don't. Try shaving it off. It's best to do this after a shower when your skin is still warm. Lather up your jawline, starting about 2"" below your jaw, and shave downwards. Stop shaving other places like your legs and armpits. While some guys can pull this off, you probably shouldn't try. * Your face may feel rubbery and strange at first. That's perfectly normal and will go away after a while. * Because the peach fuzz won't grow in that fast, it's best not to shave every day. Every 3rd day or so should be fine. 9."	Find some mascara that is the same colour as your hair and apply it to the peach fuzz on your chin, upper lip, or jawline (wherever you want it).

Understand the pros and cons of operating a day care. If you're considering opening a day care, you probably already know that you love working with kids. Take these other elements of running a day care into account before you make the decision to devote yourself to starting a new business: * Are you ready to handle the mishaps, behavioral issues and emergencies that arise when working with kids? Consider getting first aid and CPR training and potentially taking classes on childcare before assuming this responsibility. * The children's parents will have high expectations concerning their kids' activities and education while under your care. It helps to have a degree in education or experience teaching or working at a day care before opening your own. * A day care is a business, and as a business owner you'll be in charge of employee management, bookkeeping, marketing, and other responsibilities that come with running a small business in addition to providing childcare. 2. Decide what type of day care you want to open. Factoring in your time capacity, financial restraints, and personal preference, choose from two types of day cares: * A home day care. Day cares operated from homes offer home-like environments for children. They are typically small in size, and usually open to kids from the neighborhood. * A day care center, or commercial day care. Day care centers are operated from commercial spaces. They can accommodate more children and bring in more revenue, which allows them to hire more employees. 3. Understand the licensing requirements for your state.	.

Realize that doctors are trying to sell happiness through pills. If you are depressed and you tell any doctor or psychologist about it what will they tell you? ""Here take these pills. They will fix your problem?"" But will they really? What is the unspoken expectation about the pills? That they will make you happy and that they will, or might, make your life perfect. But to believe that would be to live in a fantasy. 2. Marx had the same dream of a utopia when he invented Communism. He literally thought that he would be the Robin Hood and the savior of the world by creating Communism. He believed that stealing from the rich and giving to the poor would create a perfect society where everybody would be happy. But did that happen? No, obviously not. He was just another man living in a fantasy. 3. Christians, or any person of faith, tries to sell that religious faith will make your life perfect. Some Christians try to say that getting the extra ""Baptism of the Holy Spirit"" will make your life perfect. But the fact is life sucks for every single human being alive, religious or not. You may experience an high off of either a faith or this extra dose of the Holy Spirit for a time, but as with everything, the newness fades away with time and you are again left with the mediocrity and difficulty of life. 4. For a person's entire life in school, the education system tries to sell you that good grades and more degrees will make your life perfect. It's easy to think that if you had a PhD, then your life would definitely be perfect. But that is yet another fantasy lie from Satan. More degree, a PhD, perfect grades etc. will not make you as happy as you think it will. Many people reach their graduation day for a degree thinking it will be a big high of some sort, but it isn't. It is just like any other day and it really isn't that special. Being one of the smartest kids in school will not make you happy. Being one of the smartest men in the world will not guarantee you a perfect life, because a perfect life is impossible for anyone. 5. The fashion industry tries to sell lies to women all over the world that if you can become beautiful, your life will be perfect. But that is another fantasy lie straight from the pit of hell, Satan. They try to tell you that if you get certain clothes, you will be happy. That is why so many women have shopping addictions. For a comical education on this watch the movie ""Confessions of a Shopaholic."" It is very good. Also ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is great. The beauty/fashion industry also says to women that if you get the perfect make up, you will be happy. They tell you that if you can fit into a size 1 or 3 your life will be perfect, which is by far the WORST lie and leads to thousands, if not millions, of women to eating disorders of throwing up or starving themselves. Are those girls happy? No! Far from it! 6. Money is by far the biggest fantasy lie from Satan. Everyone thinks that if you could just win the lottery or inherit a million dollars your life would be perfect, but that is a another huge lie. Money does not make people happy. The richest people in the world are often times the most miserable. Why? Because then think of all that you would have to worry about. The more you have, the more you have to worry about loosing yes? This is why God says ""Do not love the world or anything in the world"" because anything in the world will only make you miserable and will only pull your heart away from God. So be very careful. It's very easy for any worldly thing to become an idol. It's easy to be deceived by so many things in the world. 7. Then there are drugs, which appeals mostly to young people because they aren't very intelligent yet. They seem to have an inability to think of long term effects for things. They aren't educated enough on how much drugs can damage your body and your brain."	But you only need to watch any movie about a star to realize that too is a huge fantasy lie from Satan. The movie Ray is a good example of the negative effects of drugs.

Refinance for a lower interest rate. With a mortgage refinance (called a “refi”), you get a loan that pays off your current mortgage. Ideally, the new loan has a lower interest rate, which means your monthly payments will be lower. * Make sure that you are not refinancing for a longer term, as this will extend the length of your mortgage. * There are many lenders willing to refinance your mortgage. You can start with your current mortgage lender and then check rates at any other bank where you do business. * You can also search online for interest rates. Generally, your refi should lower your monthly interest rate by at least one percentage point, otherwise it probably isn’t worthwhile. 2. Refinance into a shorter term. You can also pay off your mortgage faster if you refinance a 30-year mortgage into something shorter, e.g., a 15- or 20-year mortgage. This type of refinance will reduce the total amount of interest that you pay. * Your monthly payments might not be lower. For example, refinancing a 30-year mortgage at 4.5% with a 15-year mortgage at 3.5% will save you money in the long term. However, your monthly payment will be larger. Confirm that you can afford the monthly payment. * Nevertheless, you can certainly pay off a mortgage faster by refinancing with a shorter-term loan. * Use an online calculator to determine how much you will save by refinancing. For example, Zillow has an online calculator that is easy to use. 3. Gather required documents. You’ll need to show your lender financial information, so collect this ahead of time. Doing so will make the application process smoother: * proof of income (such as two recent pay stubs or a profit-and-loss statement if self-employed) * current tax returns * tax forms, such as your W-2 or 1099s * proof of homeowner’s insurance * title insurance * information on your monthly debt load * documentation on all assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, savings accounts, and retirement accounts 4. Don’t borrow too much. Lenders may pressure you to take out more than you need. For example, your home might be worth $140,000. However, the mortgage could be only $65,000. Some lenders will encourage you to take out the max, which is usually 90-95% of your home’s value for a conventional loan. In this example, you could borrow $126,000, which is much more than you need. * Going deeper into debt doesn’t benefit you. Yes, you might pay off your mortgage faster, but now you have a new debt. 5. Review the terms of the loan. Make sure there aren’t hidden fees that will increase the cost of the refinance. For example, pay attention to the closing costs, which can substantially add to the amount you borrow. * Some lenders might claim they won’t charge you for closing costs. However, the costs are really rolled into the loan. Read the fine print. 6. Contribute your extra savings to the principal. A mortgage refinance will benefit you the most if you use the money saved to pay down principal. For example, your monthly mortgage payment might have dropped from $1,000 a month to $650. Contribute that extra $350 to the principal on your loan. 7. Remove your private mortgage insurance (PMI). You’ll pay this insurance if you financed more than 80% of your conventional mortgage. PMI costs roughly 0.05-1% of the loan amount—a meaningful sum. You should cancel this insurance and direct the amount to your principal. * You can ask to remove the PMI once your loan-to-value ratio reaches 80%.	.

Excellent. Now you need to learn how to hit them consistently. The most important rule for aiming is simply that the closer to the tip the ball is, the more to the opposite side it will go. So, for example, let's say you're holding the ball on the left flipper. You drop the flipper and let the ball roll down. If you flip again quickly, you'll send the ball more to the left. If you let the boll roll down a little more towards the tip of the flipper, the more you'll send the ball to the right.	"While the above and other rules are accurate, in truth this is where you will need to start ""learning"" the machine. What direction and with what force a ball goes in conjunction with when and how you flip all comes down to the individual machine. Even two of the same machine can play very differently dependent upon a wide variety of physical factors: how strong the flippers are and what angles they are at, how clean the machine is, how steep the machine is, etc."

Don't be shy: a certain amount of nudging is considered perfectly fair play, and done right, can often save a ball that might have otherwise been lost. Even more than aiming, when and how to nudge is an art form. Even among the experts no two players approach this with the same philosophy. Some are aggressive, some passive, some judicious, and some wild. What is important is simply to remember that machines do have tilt sensors, and if you tilt, not only does your ball end, but in most games you will lose any end-of-ball bonus points that you might have accumulated; in some case, this bonus can be enormous. Most modern games will also warn you that you are playing too hard. Take the warnings seriously. The way that tilt bobs work, sometimes the moment you get the first warning you are already doomed, since the tilt bob will keep bouncing back and forth and hitting its surrounding ring even if you stopped touching the machine entirely. More often, though, you'll get your warnings, which build up over the course of the ball. Two to three tilt warnings is usually the default.	"Really, don't abuse the machines, period: these are expensive games, most operators don't fix them all that often, and it's just plain anti-social. But added to this is that many 80s and 90s games have ""slam tilt"" sensors on the front door. If this goes off, your game automatically ends."

That might sound easy, but Drill Sergeants can yell out a lot of commands in a short time period. 3. Also, when you first meet your Drill Sergeants, there will be a lot of activity around you. Some recruits will be doing push-ups (maybe you) and others will be running in place. Make sure you are listening to only your Drill Sergeant and not other recruits. Some recruits pretend like they know what the Drill Sergeant wants and will command other recruits to follow him or her. Do not listen to them, only your Drill Sergeant. 4. Another tip is to act with confidence in everything you do. If your Drill Sergeant asks your rank, don’t whisper “Private First Class Drill Sergeant, Private First Class�?. Shout it loud. Drill Sergeants like motivation and confidence; it exemplifies a person’s strength. 5.	Drill Sergeants are going to give you tasks that are designed for you to fail. When you fail you feel broken and when you feel broken they are able to build you up again. Essentially they are breaking down your civilian attitude and building you into a soldier. That doesn’t come easy, at least in the U.S military. Even if your facing the ground about to accomplish what seems to be your 500th push up, continue on and sound motivated.
Pass_the_BDS_Exams.txt	Begin_Revision	0.905	## Steps	16	So keep a large numbers of ' second options ' .	## Steps	38	Keep a large numbers of ' second options ' .	<delete><So><1>|||<replace><keep><2><Keep><1>	True	Steps  1. Step 1 Be relaxed. Thousands of students all over the world pass these exams every year. All you need is some smart efforts. 2. Step 2 Watch a nice movie first. It will encourage you as well as make you feel guilty that you are not preparing properly for the exams which in turn will make you capable of doing more hard work. 3. Step 3 Please do not read for hours together and for more than 10 hours a day. There are two advantages of this: First overloading your memory like this does not help you in any way. You wont remember anything until your exams. Second, working like this makes you satisfied about your preparation and blind about the further needs. It,ll make you pity yourself and you will be overconfident while revising and just flip the pages. 4. Step 4 It has been a general belief that Dentistry being a Hardcore science, the examiners are just interested in data and poor presentation can be excused but believe me, you may pass theory exams without knowing anything about Dentistry but with a really good handwriting.So improve your presentation. 5. Step 5 Read the standard books.Plus, get some brand new data from internet.It may contain really useless data just presented in a lavish language, but remember that your examiner knows every basic thing about the topic so giving something new is always good. 6. Step 6 Befriend your seniors. They are your real guides. 7. Step 7 Work hard for getting patients for practicals. Believe me, they can just deny for coming for no reasons.	And yes always make them feel that its their fortune to be chosen by you. It is better to get them from a lower middle-class locality in stead of slums. People from slums are absolutely non-trustworthy. Do not offer money, it is insulting. But yes, getting them a nice breakfast before exams is good.

Measure the width and depth of your shoulder pads. You can either measure over the curve of your shoulder or inside your garment’s armhole. Think about where you want the shoulder pad positioned and use a tape measure to see how wide and deep it will need to be to fit within this area. * For example, a your measurements could be wide by deep. 2. Draw a paper pattern in the shape of your shoulder pads. Draw a rectangle with the width and depth measurements. Then, sketch in curves along the inner and outer edge. The pattern will be D-shaped, with a little more volume towards one side. This side will be used towards the back of the shoulder area. Mark the pattern piece “R” on one side, and “L” on the reverse so you’ll remember which shapes are intended for the right and left shoulders. * You can also made your shoulder pads symmetrical, in which case you won’t need to mark the right and left sides. * Different shaped shoulder pads perform better for different types of garments. You might want the shoulder pad to add more volume directly above your shoulder and extend a little beyond. For this you’ll want a more of a circular shape. 3. Trace the pattern onto quilters’ batting 4 times and cut. Pin the paper pattern onto a piece of quilters’ batting, with the “R” side up. With a fabric marker or pencil, trace around the edges and mark the batting “R.” Repeat for a second piece. Then, flip the pattern piece to the “L” side, and mark out 2 “L” pieces. Cut all 4 pieces out. 4. Mark the pattern onto lining fabric, adding seam allowance. Pin the pattern onto a piece of lining fabric and trace around the pattern piece. Do this once for the “R” side and once for the “L” side.	.

Check the stage for room for instruments, practice and preparation rooms if necessary, restrooms, and also zones for tech places. These zones are for any tech people or ""roadies"" which may include band mates and yourself so that you are anyone else can fix or prep any equipment. Many times your equipment can and will fail, so with these zones they are are out of the way and out of sight. Tech rooms are optional and are recommended for any show playing more than four musical numbers. You want to make sure you know where everything is, so there are no surprises later on. 3. Set up on stage. If able to, set up all of your gear on stage and near the sides, including any tech zones in the week's days before the event at the latest to see if everything can be placed effectively.

Arrange video chat dates. Use technology to your advantage, especially if you are physically apart from your boyfriend, and arrange video chat dates at least once a week. This will allow you and your boyfriend to see each other and talk face to face, even if it is through a phone or a computer. Having a visual reference when he speaks to you will remind your boyfriend how much he misses you and give him images to return to when you are not around. 2. Surprise him with a gift or a special date. Another good way to make your boyfriend miss you is to create special memories together that he will not want to forget. This could mean surprising him with a special gift, like an item of clothing he has always wanted, or planning a special date to see a band he really likes. * Keep the relationship spontaneous and exciting by planning surprise activities that you can do together. This will allow you and your boyfriend to spend quality time together and build memories that will serve as reminders of how enjoyable your relationship is. 3. Write him a love letter. Be extra romantic and write down your feelings and emotions in a letter for your boyfriend to find later on his pillow, in his bag, or in his car. Use nice stationery and be as intimate and honest as you can. Seal the letter and leave it somewhere where he can find it easily. When he finds it and opens it, he will think of you and miss your loving presence. * You can also send him a loving text via your phone, and remember to wish him good night or good morning, especially if you are apart from each other. This will help you both to maintain a strong connection to each other and show your boyfriend he is always on your mind. 4. Do things for him that he loves. This could be preparing his favorite meal, giving him a massage in an area he enjoys, or allowing him time to focus on his own hobbies or passions. Show him how generous and loving you can be by focusing on his needs and desires. Of course, do not neglect your own needs or desires, as the relationship should always be about mutual respect and acceptance.	.
Plant_a_Lowbush_Blueberry.txt	Inside_Revision	0.905	## Steps	63	Then cover with a shallow mulch ( bark ) .	## Steps	82	Cover with a shallow mulch ( bark ) .	<delete><Then><1>|||<replace><cover><2><Cover><1>	True	Steps  1. My experience is from Michigan. I have natural lowbush blueberries growing in my woods. I have taken rhizomes from existing blueberry clones and grown them in pots and planted them in my yard for native landscaping and berries. Because these plants grow here naturally I do not amend for pH. I believe pH should range between 4.5 and 5.5. 2. First identify which plants to grow during the preceding growing season. This is the time to select for: size, berry color, fall leaf color, flavor, and species. Blueberries are highly variable plants. You may even find huckleberry. Mark with ribbon the plants you wish to use. 3. In early spring a few weeks before bud break dig the selected blueberry rhizomes. Taking pieces between 6 and 12 inches in length. Some of the pieces may have above ground stems which can be left attached. Select from several clones, this aids in pollination and fruit set. 4. Plant the rhizomes in one gallon pots. Use a sand and peat mix. Actually the growing medium will not be mixed. Fill the bottom half with sand and the top with peat. Plant the rhizome in the peat just above the sand. 5. After planting place the pots in a semi shaded (protected) place. Keep pots moist but not waterlogged. 6. After a few weeks some of the plants with above ground parts will break bud. At this time move them to a sunny location until ready for outplanting. Fertilize sparingly with a soluble fertilizer designed for acidic plants, available at most garden centers. Keep pots moist. 7. Finally locate where you want to plant the blueberries. Try to get as much sun as possible if fruit is desired. Also avoid close proximity to concrete walks and foundations (high pH). Simply dig a shallow hole and set the rootball in and backfill. Because these are rhizomatous plants planting depth is not super critical. Deeper is probably better than shallow.	Weeding is important as blueberries do not tolerate heavy competition.

Understand what a major chord is. A chord is three or more notes. Complex chords can have many notes, but you need a minimum of three. * A major chord has a very specific set of notes: the tonic, or root of the chord (0). This is the note that the chord is named after; the major third, which gives the chord its character (4 semitones above the root); and the fifth, which anchors the chord and makes it complete—7 semitones above the root. * Every major chord has all three of those. In their most basic form, they are arranged as 0-4-7. For a C major chord, for example C is the tonic (0). Four semitones up from that is the major third: E. Three semitones up from that (or seven up from the root) is G. 2. Construct a major chord in any key. Start with the first note of the scale, called the tonic in music theory. Find the major third by proceeding up four half-steps. Find the fifth (also called the dominant) by counting seven half-steps up from the tonic (or three semitones up from the major third. * Understand that there are often at least two ways to spell a chord.	The notes D, F𝄪, A create a D Major chord, which sounds exactly like an Eb chord, but is more complex than needs to be addressed here. We will stick to more common chord spellings for the balance of this article, and save enharmonic equivalents for a future article.

It is not about breaking the law; what it is about is exercising your right and responsibility to opt out, as informed by the TSA which states that ""Every day is opt-out day"". On November 24, 2010, we the people are standing up for our right to not be stripped naked, forcefully searched, and treated as guilty for the mere act of purchasing an airline ticket and wanting to fly. 3. Simply opt out as you approach the scanner (AIT, or Advance Imaging Technology) machines. On November 24, tell the operator: ""I opt out"". 4. Realize that this will cause you to have to undergo the enhanced pat down. This is because you have a choice between one bad method and another bad method, effectively meaning that there is no choice. This can mean that your genitals will be touched forcefully. Inform the operator that you want your pat down in full public and that you do not want to be touched in a way that you consider to be sexual harassment or assault. Everyone will be able to see what is happening if you refuse the offer to be searched in a back room, with the idea being that this will increase public concern over a highly invasive procedure. 5. Turn up earlier."	The aim is not to create delays but to educate the public. However, delays may end up being one side effect.

For 'Crown' Cap bottles: 1. Examine your environment for suitable edges, crevices, slots, holes and shapes that might allow a bottle-top to be inserted. 2. Check if a real bottle-opener is available, this can save a lot of time. 3. Try opening the bottle with a lighter. It's not as easy as you'd think, but it's a knack which converts swear by. Flat-sided lighters work best..Method: * Grip the bottle firmly, holding the neck in a thumbs-up manner, with your thumb on the cap. Your fingers should be wrapped around the neck of the bottle, the top finger should leave a lighters width from the cap. * Insert the lighter bottom between your top finger and the bottom of the cap, aiming above the centre of the bone between your knuckle and first finger joint, such that the lighter is perpendicular to the finger bone. * Tighten your grip of the bottle and wrap that lighter lever around your finger. If you're holding the bottle right, the cap will pop off. Try it a few times to get the grip right, and it won't hurt. 4. Vending Machines are useful because they have a handy recessed coin return. Stick the cap in there and push down firmly. Use only strong metal installations. 5. Household Items can be brought in service. It may be a hunt to find something effective: * Reports of Belt-Buckle openers were followed up. Result: they work ok if they're the right shape. * On a lighter note we might use a kid's Ice-Skates. Much the best skates are the expensive ones with hollow sections in the blade. Unfortunately most people don't have those sort.. 6. If you have two bottles, it is alleged you can put the caps together and latch them both off simultaneously. Many users report this does not work very well. 7. Sometimes only random metal objects may be available:Method: * Try sticking the bottle into a door jamb, at the metal plate. Close the door and twist the bottle down, and you might not lose any contents. A potential stained carpet must reduce this method's attractiveness. * Alternatively place the edge of the bottle cap on any edge (preferably metal). Hit it with the palm of your hand. Don't use wooden edges, or you ruin them.. 8. A Wedding or Class ring is an ideal way to remove a soda or beer bottle cap. Simply hold the bottle in the non-ring hand and place the ring hand, palm down, over the bottle cap. Hook the ring on the edge of the cap farthest from the palm of your hand, with the proper pressure the cap will pop off. Depending on the shape of the ring, you may experience some pain on the top of the ring finger and opening many bottles in a row may result in swelling, so use common sense. If it hurts too much or your finger swells...stop.  Opening Wine bottles: * Why is it that either there are either corkscrews in every drawer of the house, or none to be had at all?	.

Remember what you're trying to do at the net. When you go the the net, you're looking for a quick finish to the point. You generally only go the the net on your opponents mistake or if you have plenty of time and you're making them run around. 2. Don't swing. You never, never, swing at the net, with one exeption. The overhead slam. Other than that, never. Here's why. If you're at the net, your opponent's shot is getting to you rather quickly. Rather fast, unless done otherwise intentionally. Just bouncing it off your racket will make it go plenty fast. If you swing, that's an easy way to get it out. 3. Be prepared. If your opponent engages you in net battle (which you shouldn't allow to happen, it becomes a hit-15 luck game), then immediatly send him back by doing a baseline lob. It will have him running back to get the ball. If your opponent does this to you, than go back, hit it powerfully, and STAY AT THE BASELINE. Just make sure you play with powerful shots and keep your opponent from getting to the net, because now he's looking for an opportunity. If he fails at a baseline lob and does a pop-up instead, that's when you're allowed to swing. You slam it down as hard as you can and watch your opponent feel like an idiot. 4.	Make shots evenly. Left corner, right corner, left corner, right corner. once you've done this, if your opponent has kept up, you fake out and do this. Left corner, right corner, left corner, right corner, right corner. He'll be dashing towards the left and realize he needs to go back. He'll go back and hit it into the net.
Manage_Throwing_Up.txt	Begin_Revision	0.926	### Talking to someone	133	So while you can , this is the time for some hand talk .	### Talking to someone	173	While you can , this is the time for some hand talk .	<delete><So><1>|||<replace><while><2><While><1>	True	Talking to someone  1. You might be talking to your crush or your best friend somewhere and you have the urge to throw up, here's a tip, when you feel something inching up your throat expecting a burp, DON'T TRUST IT. Especially when your sick. While you have time before the throw up comes, quickly say to the person your talking to that you have to go real quick. Hold your mouth and run to a trash can or a bathroom. Drink a glass of water if you have time, that will make the throw up watery, not chunky and coughy. If you get to the bathroom and don't have time, feel free to throw up on the floor or in a sink. 2. If the person has to tell you something really important right now and they won't let you go, I don't think you can talk now, because that gives the throw up a fast way to inch your way up your throat, and while you stick there trying to find out a way to talk to the person without making this awkward, the throw up might come.	"If your fast at throwing up, I suggest you run away and find a trash can as quick as possible. But anyways. if your planning to do the hand language, pat on your stomach or wave near your stomach and pull your hands up to your mouth and move it down, if the person thinks your playing a game and starts guessing, shake your head, put your hands infront of your face and pretend your holding a controller playing a game, then shake your head LIGHTLY while moving both your arms around, it's supposed to mean: ""It's not a game, I'm going to throw up!"" Well, THATS if your a pro at holding your throw up in for a long time, if your medium at throwing up, you won't be able to do the ""No Gaming"" one. If they think your playing a game, then run a little to the nearest trash can, don't run TOO fast because if your stomach jumps up in down, the throw up is going to come up faster. Just do awkward skip-runs. The reason why I don't want you to shake your head FAST is because, the slightest movement being dizzy will make you more sick. When your done, drink alot of water, find some paper towels or tissue to wipe your mouth if you have throw up all over it. Sometimes, when your done throwing up and relaxed, than the throw up sometimes will come back. It depends on what made you like that, too much food will cause AT LEAST 2 throw ups. When your done with your business, go back to your friend/date and apologize about that and explain that you were going to throw up. But hey, you tell them what you want to tell them."

First, you are obviously going to need to play your instrument well. Most rock is electric guitar driven so focus on having a tight sound because you are the sound! 2. The material you learn will be very important. Depending on what type of rock you want to play. Personally, I like alot of classic rock, blues, jam bands, so to prepare for a try-out for this type of band I would listen to giants of these genre's. Also, it's important to dig to the roots of the music you like. If you want to play metal you should know how metal started, who it's founders were, and when they played (ex. if you like Widespread or Phish you should know something about the Grateful Dead). This is important because your band will most likely end up covering alot of the songs you've heard. 3. Almost all rock is blues and jazz based (deathmetal/screamo being the exception sometimes) so learn your blues and jazz scales/chords. Understanding these thoroughly will greatly help your knowledge of music theory. 4. Ok, so you've got a band now, as a guitarist several things are important. 1st, loud is good, not being able to understand the words or hear the bassline because your gain is on 11 isn't. And remember, you will be able to understand the words better than the audiance because you know all the songs. Also, if you have 2 guitarist, make sure to variate your chord voicings (positions) so you aren't playing the same riff and the other guy except during solos. 5. Pedals and processors and be a good thing but before you go spend $1000 on that make sure you have a legit guitar and amp 1st. Blues, rock, country, jam bands, and reggae i would strongly recommend an all tube amp. Not so much for metal and hardcore.	Strats and Les Paul's for blues, Tele's for country/folk or whatever. i'm just saying you don't wanna cover metallica with a semi-hollow body Ibanez.

I recomend the Seaside Plot as it has lots of land and isn't very far away from the town. It's right next to the sea so you can also fish to make extra cash as well. 3. I'm going to pretend you picked the Seaside plot. Wether you did or not is up to you. First, pick all the weeds in your land. Do it until you have little x's over your eyes. Then go to bed! After you wake up, there will be one or two more weeds, but pick the rest of the rest of them. 4. Now, take your hoe and hoe two rows with six spots in them each. 5. Plant the seeds you got from Ruth. 6. Water them. 7. Now, go to bed! 8. Now, get up everyday and water those plants. After you water them, you maybe tired. Ok, after watering the plants one morning, go to your mailbox. Then run across the left bridge, and to the first sign. Then go up and take the first turn on your left. Keep going until you reach carmel falls.	Go up all the stone ramps. Head over the homemade path of rocks and push A on the hot spring. This restores your health for one day.

When you're in doubt about what to do, or when you encounter something similar to this, better make the problem shooting to the professionals. You don't want to risk your life or your families, you may get electrocuted. It is during these times you need to contact an electrician. Do not place and your household 's danger at the hands of an unlicensed electrician. You may wind up spending more money and having more issues. Thus, to prevent unnecessary mishaps, a professional Houston Electrician is the most likely candidate. 2. But when you avail the services of a specialist technician, you must know those things that you have to avert. Preventing these things might save you time, money and effort as time goes on. 3. STEP ONE: Don't Hurry in choosing a ContractorYes, sometimes we badly and immediately need the assistance of an electrician. But tend not to make the error of only looking within the net or at the yellow pages, pick someone who says they will be there on time and avail this electrician's services. You have to take into account some variables before you need to decide. Initially, you check if they had any customer complaints and have to understand the reputation of a contractor. Some authors would say assess their company first. However, there's an alternative way to do that, should you not want to do extra homework. The best method to ensure that you get a reputable contractor that is good would be to request friends and family as well as friends to get a trustworthy contractor whose electrician they'd tried before. This way, you will receive a reference that's trusted and established. 4. STEP TWO: Do Not Forget to Inquire if He has a Valid Insurance and PermitEnsuring you will get an accredited technician is a significant recommendation for the majority of people who wished to avail the assistance of electrical contractors. However, there are electricians who actually don't have a permit that is valid. They might have one at some point but their permit had expired. Therefore, it is important to test whether electricians had a legal permit from a community board. Having an accredited electrician, he's enough experience in installing updating and maintaining all electrical work together with comfortable in managing whole electric repair.	Availing an electrician that has insurance makes sure that he is really well versed in security standards and electric techniques.

Unfired clay: All clay not fired can be reused by placing in a bucket covered with water. Dry clay dissolves more thoroughly than leather hard. To reuse clay place on a 3 inch thick 'Potter's Plaster' table constructed for the purpose. (US Gypsum used to have the best, but not sure they still have it) Plaster absorbs water out of the clay. Place clay on plaster, from 2 to 3 inches thick and let harden, usually from 1 to 3 days, depending on the dampness of the plaster. Dry bottom, turn over until proper hardness throughout is achieved.	Clay is stored and sealed in thick plastic bags. Different clays with different firing vitrification temperatures should not be mixed together. Wedged clay can be laid on plaster to increase hardness and strength for use as coils and slabs.

To begin meditating you just need an easy, basic meditation program to introduce you to the benefits of meditation. 2. You need an alert mind to make the most of meditation, so you need to be free of alcohol or non prescribed drugs for at least 24 hours. 3. Wait 2 hours after a full meal or an hour after a snack or a caffeine drink before meditating, as the digestive system can be very distracting. 4. If you smoke it is best to wait for roughly thirty minutes before meditating. 5. You need to make sure you have some peace and quiet around you when you first begin learning to meditate. This is critical to your success. 6. Make sure all phones are turned off/disconnected or turned to silent. 7. A scented candle, a bouquet of flowers, a incense or something else pleasing to you can be great little touches to enhance your first meditation. This can make coming out of meditation a beautiful thing! 8. Dim your lights or turn them off if you are going to use candles. You don't want to come out of your meditation session into bright light. 9. Use a straight backed chair to sit upright or use some cushions/pillows to support your back and head. 10.	.

Plan your itinerary to Austin; calculate how far you are going to ride. Determine how many miles you’ll be riding per day based on your previous road trips. Trace the towns you are planning to sleep or stop at. If this is your first time, you may ask an experienced friend or biker to serve as your basis for the itinerary. A road map, GPS, or a simple mobile phone that has Internet connection can be of use when driving in unfamiliar routes. 2. Surf the web for camping grounds, lodges, inns, and motels that will be along your way, so it will be convenient to stop over and recharge for the next day. Make early reservations ahead of time so you’ll be sure to get a place to rest during your journey. During peak season like ROT Rally, rates can insanely double as the kick off date approaches. (FYI: I stayed at the Omni Downtown a couple of times) Getting early reservations for places to stay in event location is a must. You don’t want to find yourself looking for a place to stay when everybody is having fun. You could miss an activity or your favorite band. If you run out of lodging options, try the outskirts of town or neighboring cities, perhaps Round Rock.Usually, the official website of the event provides links and contact numbers for hotel, RV and tent camping partners. Or you can just contact me and I'll help you out. 3. Have your bike checked by a mechanic early on. Get it tuned up at least a month before to avoid trouble on the road.Make sure you bring your tool bag, that has all the essential tools like wrenches and such just in case it breaks down in the middle of nowhere. Or at least have a roadside service number handy. Roadside assistance can save the day when you need them. 4.	Make sure you wear the proper safety gear for protection. Remember, a strong half helmet is the way to go to have a panoramic view of the Texas countryside. Bring quick energy snacks like candy bars, peanuts, granola bars, power bars, dried fruit, and water to quench your thirst just in case. They don't take up much room in a saddlebag.

Dinner is a nice option since it allows enough time for casual conversation, plenty of laughs and a nice time. It let you both get to know one another and the great food. 3. Go to the movies. A movie is great, if you are careful to pick the right one: probe him/her to find out what kind of movies she likes, does she/he like comedies, dramas, or horror films? If you both don't love the same type, then just try and choose one that you both will agree. Like, she/he wants to see a horror but you, an action, pick a drama.	.

Adhere strips of clear double-sided tape to wax paper. Tear a sheet of wax paper that is as long as you’d like your finished rolls of faux washi tape to be. Then, unroll strips of double-sided tape and stick one side of each strip along the length of the wax paper. * Clear double-sided tape comes in rolls just like single-sided clear tape. * You can easily fit 6-8 strips of tape across a sheet of wax paper. * True washi tape is made of paper derived from trees and shrubs native to Japan. It has a masking tape-like texture, but is better known for having intricate decorative designs on it. 2. Trim the excess wax paper around each strip of tape. Use scissors to cut the wax paper between each strip of tape, then cut around the edges of each strip of tape. Get as close as you can to the edges of the tape—sharp crafting scissors are best for this job. * The wax paper is just there to preserve the sticky side of your finished tape. 3. Press the sticky side of each strip of tape onto a sheet of tissue paper. Gather up several sheets of tissue paper with designs that catch your eye, and lay them flat on the table. Adhere your tape strips to the tissue paper and press them down firmly. * If you don’t mind making shorter rolls of tape, you can unfold decorated napkins and use them instead.	.

Get the best deal. Research can really pay off and you can avoid paying full price. It's almost as if the staff are trained to list all the ways you can get a discount. There are tons of other ones you can do but these are some options: * You cannot get a kingdom ticket on any discount. They usually tell you when you present these vouchers that the dungeons aren't included, and they aren't lying! The only way around it is to use your voucher on regular tickets and then add the dungeon on top. This still gets a fair amount of money off, but not as much if you were not to go in the dungeons. * Booking in advance - The prices are at their highest when special shows are going on during the summer. For this time, you can get £9 off the regular adult price. * Kellogs and Cadbury's vouchers - These are sometimes sold in a shop in the entrance you can go to before visiting the castle. There are tons of these products in every supermarket across Britain, so finding them is a breeze. * Student cards - Show your student card and you can get 50% off, so it's really worth a shot! * English Heritage - Although it's not an English Heritage site, if you have a full membership (one with a card) then you also get 50% off! * AA - There's an AA discount available if you show your card, up to 40% off. * Military/forces discount - Bring your military cards just in case. * Visiting the site the day before - This is a really sneaky way of getting a day ticket for £1 over half price. Go to the castle the day before your visit, between 3.30pm and 5pm (summer opening hours, it may be different when you visit). They sell half price tickets at this time. Keep these tickets and the day after, you can get ""next day tickets"" for £1! 2. Plan what you want to see. * Horrible Histories - This really depends on what kind of humour you're into, I often hear 90% of the crowd giving it high praise. (Just a shame if you're like me and are in the 10%) * Birds of Prey: *** Three stars. Usually the morning show is way better than the afternoon one as they will have more exciting birds. (Maybe they have to give the birds a rest?) It was my first time ever seeing a golden eagle fly! Don't worry about getting there on time though, you don't need a front row seat to see a bird fly. We usually use it as an in-between show and once you've seen the bird fly around for a few minutes it becomes like a lot of other shows out there. If you live in Britain, you'll know that we do a lot of bird shows at historical sites and we've seen quite a lot so that's why I'm saying three stars. * Bowman- *** Also three stars, the man that does this is quite funny and he has some interesting facts to share but there's only so long you can stand around watching a man hit a target with arrows. It's good, though, if you want some good history and also something interesting for the kids to watch. * Trebuchet- **** Four stars. The only reason I give it four stars is because it takes about ten minutes to actually shoot it, a bit of a sily reason as it's necessary to get the right tension ect. but I'm an impatient person! However, there is a man to entertain you and get you all excited and he is very funny and tels you all sorts of interesting facts about manning the trebuchet. * Jousting- ***** Five stars. This on normal entry ticket prices is worth every penny you spend! It was a complete surprise so I won't spoil it for you but let's just say they have pirotechnics, stunts and special effects. It's above and beyond anything similar I've seen and I'm really gald that they've semed to pull out all the stops for this amazing show! I also learned so much about the war of the roses without having to put much work in so it's honestly very very worth it!! 3. Which attractions should you do? Again, my ratings on all the things that are on offer at the castle (that I've been to, even with the amount of times I've gone, I haven't been able to do everything!): * Great Hall and state rooms- * One star. Don't get me wrong, these are impressive. But I never was interested in history enough to do this kind of thing. Which is why, unusually, I was really happy when merlin took over, it made history really fun for me! There's only so much you can do with these bits however and with my innability to concentrate I just wasn't interested. But if you're into your history it's worth a visit! * History tours- * One star. Again, this is just because of my lack of interest. I know, I know... ""you're going to a historical site, what do you expect?"" But there are other things to do at Warwick castle that I'm just far more interested in and some of these tours can last for quite a while. But again, if you're into that sort of thing, do it! (Just don't bring your kids along!) * The Mill and engine room- ** Two stars. It's interesting, but it's one of those things you do if you've done everything else. What is nice though is when you walk right through the engine house to the other side and stroll alongside the castles intimidating walls. * Towers and ramparts- *** Three stars. This is super cool to do, just very tiring (duh!) You get great views as you go around and you get a sense of just how big the castle is. It's only three stars because there's not much going on up there, it's just for the views."	.

Pick a champion. You can try different champions out each week. Find your style. * There are several roles you can play in the League. Marksman (ADC/Attack Damage Carry), Mage (APC/Ability Power Carry), Tank, Support, and Jungler. Each play an important role in the game. * The Marksman attacks from range, dealing physical damage. The marksman are accompanied by the support character. * The Mage, or APC, attacks and deals magic damage using a variety of spells. * The tank is the ""front line"" for the team. They build defensively, able to progressively take more and more damage. * The support aids the ADC (and later on the entire team). Whether the support has a slow, a stun (which is called crowd-control, or CC), or abilities to heal the ADC, they're very useful in the laning phase and are very important. The ADC depends on the support to get them ""fed"" (a lot of kills so they can be more useful late game). * The Jungler goes around to camps on the map, and killing them. At the same time, they can gank (ambush the enemy team for a kill) for their team, and provide kills for themselves or the lanes they're ganking. Good j=Junglers know routes, buffs, have good map awareness, and know when to gank. 2. Learn the mechanics. Mechanics are the way the game works, and the way the champion works. Learn a bit about each role so you know what you could be matched up against. It's also good to learn about an enemy, and learn your boundaries.' * Learn how to farm. Farming is very important in League; it brings in income, which buys items, and items win games. Last-hitting is sometimes hard, especially when you're getting harassed down by the enemies. * Learn map awareness. Look at the mini-map frequently. Try looking every 5 seconds. Having map awareness can sometimes save you from a gank. If you see someone coming, knowing your champion, and how they work (also the same with the enemy champ) can help you get out alive. Make it a habit to look at the map. If you can't spare a glance at the mini-map, you're not in that hard a fight. * Learn how to ""juke"". Juking means going into a bush, going stealth, etc., waiting for the champ to find you, and go the other way. Juking can be hard to do at first, but it can keep you alive and put distance between you and your enemies. 3. Study the champion you're wanting to play. * For example, if you are playing Annie, learn what her Q, W, E, and R does, her passive, her builds, and how she can initiate or escape a fight. * The Q, for most champions, is the thing that does damage (such as Caitlyn's Q; Piltover Peacemaker). * The W, for most champions, usually gives a boost (such as Varus's W; Blighted Quiver). * The E, for most champions, is utility or gives a bit of damage. For ADCs, it gives damage. For mages, could be a shield or power-up. It depends on what champion you're playing. * The R, or ultimate, is the handiest ability for any champion. It gives them a boost, it gives them more damage, it can heal, stun, etc., and has a long cooldown."	.

Also, if you have been to this camp before, see if the air conditioner is cold or warm. 3. Pick a good pillow for sleeping. Make sure to make it a comfy one from home. Don't go on a Shopping Spree just for a pillow. Make sure that you feel comfortable with it. This will be 1 of 2 pillows. Sometimes you can even make sure that it matches your heavy layer. 4. Pick a thin layer. This can be a small lap blanket. This will be great for those extra cold nights. Even if it is in a hot location.

If you have more basic Pokemon cards in your hand, you can put them face down beneath your hands if you want(this is your bench). 8. Determine who attacks first. Flip a coin to see who starts if you are having trouble deciding who should go first. 9. On your turn, draw the card at the top of your deck. * You can attach one Energy card under any Pokemon. But only one. * You can't use Trainer, Supporter or Stadium cards on the first turn, but you can afterwards. * You also can't evolve Pokemon on the each player's first turn but you can afterwards as well. Also, you cannot evolve Pokemon cards that have just evolved on that turn. * You can use any Poke powers or Poke-bodies even if that Pokemon isn't your active Pokemon. 10. Attack."	.

Pour the water into a large pot and heat it over high heat until the water is boiling. Then, add in all of the tapioca pearls in the package and make sure they’re all completely submerged in the water. * If the pearls aren’t submerged, add of water at a time until they are. 3.

But, make sure that the foundation is really, really close to your skin tone. You don't want to look fake. 4. Purchase a concealer. Concealer is my lifesaver! It is perfect for those days when you don't want to wear foundation but still want to cover up any blemishes or flaws.	All you have to do is apply it over your foundation! You can buy a concealer stick, which is more easier to apply, or one that comes in a tube. Covergirl Ready Set Gorgeous is a good one.

In ancient times this would have been a dagger with which they could cut meat and defend the house. ""May your home always be protected from intruders."" 4. Step right on to the trap door of the root cellar, or go to the pantry, and give the salt to the couple. ""May there always be flavor and spice in your life."" Any kind of salt will do. Even the orange decorative salt is acceptable. 5. Walk over to the sleeping area. This is especially important if it is a new couple with no kids. Give them the rice. ""May the love in your home multiply."" This is for fertility and/or a long, blessed marriage. 6. Go to the kitchen. This is often called the heart of the house. Present the Bread to the couple in the kitchen, and say ""May those in your home never go hungry."" 7. Give them the wine. ""May you always have joy and never go thirsty."" It may be symbolic. Any juice will do. 8. Move into the dining room. If they don't have a dining room, you can do this in the kitchen. Give them the honey. ""May you always enjoy the sweetness of life."" 9.

Another aspect that has attracted a lot of people towards online marketing is the fact that one doesn’t have to have his own products to get started. In online marketing, one can start making a lot of money just by selling, or even by just trying to sell, other people’s products.	All that one needs to do is to set up an agreement with an online retailer or merchant, and after everything is settled, one can immediately start making money by selling the merchant’s or the retailer’s products.
Organize_a_Messy_Bedroom.txt	Begin_Revision	0.67	## Steps	2058	Finally , clean up miscellaneous items .	## Steps	2104	Clean up miscellaneous items .	<delete><Finally><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><clean><3><Clean><1>	True	Steps  1. Put items that don't belong in the bedroom back where they're from. You might be surprised by how much of the stuff in your bedroom isn't actually supposed to be there. Before you can even think of arranging and displaying items, put items that are not meant to be there back into their original positions. Put your dirty dishes into the sink to wash them later. Throw away that greasy pizza box you had on your bedside table since last week from watching Netflix. If you're supposed to, take your shoes out into the hallway or back into your shoe rack. 2. Next, take out ALL of your clothes (from the closet, under the bed, etc) and gather them in one place. To sort them, we can use the KonMari method. Pick up a piece of clothing and see if it 'sparks joy', Keep it if yes, discard if not. Another way would be to put on a 'show' with your friend giving his/her opinion. That way, you can gather some feedback from your friend on that piece of clothing. Once you're done sorting your clothes, I'd suggest giving them a good wash in the washing machine. While that happens, take this opportunity to clean and dust your closet and to get some new, sturdy hangers. Dresses and thich sweaters should be hanged neatly, while jeans and shirts can be folded and placed in the shelves of your closet. Small things like socks, underwear and scarves should be sorted into baskets and placed inside the closet. 3. After that, you might want to have a space specifically just for your makeup and personal grooming. So basically, it's time to organize your cosmetics and such. Prepare a place for personal grooming ONLY. This is the place where you freshen yourself up or put on makeup, so try to make it tidy all of the time. Buy some baskets to hold your makeup, lotions, etc. Sort them by category (eg. Small items such as lipstick in one basket, brushes in another) Remember to have a large garbage bag with you when cleaning so that whenever you find something broken or old, you can easily separate it from the items you wish to keep. 4. It would be good to also set a space for studying purposes. If you can, get a desk with some drawers that can make organizing easier. If you already have a desk but it's messy, to clean it up start with papers first. Papers tend to accumulate over time and it's high time you got rid of them. Use this rule when sorting papers: If it's from over a year ago and doesn't affect you now, then throw it. When you finish, tackle the stationery. Throw away broken pens and pencils. Check your markers to see if they still work, throw out crayons snapped in half and items such as glue that are already finished. Make a list of items you will need to buy so that when you finish cleaning up, you can replace the stationery you threw away. Buy a file holder to hold your papers. This will save you time when you're looking for homework or documents. Store your computer when you're not using it inside the drawer (if you have one)and organize your stationary like this: Put the pencils and pens you use often inside one pen holder, coloring materials and craft supplies in another drawer (if you have one. If not, place them in a small basket on top of the desk. If your computer leaves a lot of empty space inside the drawer, add some extra materials that you might need beside it. Don't leave any clothing on the desk or under and place restrictions, such as no eating food on the desk or no using your phone. This helps eliminate distractions while doing homework or studying. 5. After storing your clothes, see if you have any closet space left. If yes, you can make use of that space by storing bags and hats there. On the inside door of the closet, you can put up some posters or hang up a to-do list there. You can also put hooks there to hang up jewelry. 6.	If you have a bedside table, organize this too. It should contain only a few things: An alarm clock, maybe a framed photo or two, a bedside lamp and a holder for your keys, cards and other small things you use everyday. That way, you can easily find your keys in the morning when you're late for school/work. If you have any sentimental items you wish to keep, put them all in one box and place it under your bed or inside the closet if you have space. If you have any off-season clothing, do the same as you would to sentimental items. If you have some random junk that you can't bear to part with, try to categorize it and put it with items of the same category. If you have any sports equipment, it's best to put them in the hallway or somewhere near the door instead of the bedroom. It's easier for you to grab them in a rush that way. As for trophies and medals, you can get them hanged up on the wall or if you have a dresser instead of a closet, you can place them on top of the dresser. You can also put jewelry on top of the dresser, but rememer to store them in a box or a small set of drawers so they won't break or become tangled.

Skate shops are better in my opinion because they are made for skating and the people there are a little more educated about what you need for your skill level 3. Now find a helmet with a cool graphic or design on there. Skate logo's are best. Try and find a skating helmet instead of a bike helmet because they are both made for different reasons and should be used for those purposes. 4. Check if it fits it should be snug but not painful. To loose will make it fall of when you hit it on something."	And if it doesn't fit you won't be protected and it will look horrible.

Let your child help you pack their lunch. Have your child participate in choosing their gluten free lunch and help you package their lunch in their lunch box. Offer two options for lunch and let them pick the one they prefer. Doing this will allow your child to actively participate in choosing their gluten free meal, and hopefully enjoy their selection. 3. Inform your child’s teacher about their gluten intolerance. Giving your child’s teacher a heads up on their gluten free diet will help the teacher watch for any cross contamination in the lunchroom and keep your child’s diet in mind when interacting with the other kids. * The teacher can also ensure special meal is available for your child if a class party or trip involves a shared meal, or let you know you will need to provide a special meal for your child, such as gluten free pizza for a pizza party, or gluten free treats for a birthday or holiday celebration. 4. Try to make your child’s meals as similar to the other kids’ meals as possible. Children can be exposed to ridicule or teasing from classmates that have a standard lunch, so try to mask gluten free food to be similar to traditional lunch foods.	.

Invest in a crosscut paper shredder and completely destroy any piece of paper that has your credit card number, your social security number, or your bank account number on it.center * If you get a shredder, make sure it’s one which doesn’t just create strips of paper which can be pieced back together. If you don’t get a shredder, at least tear the materials into small pieces. When using this strategy, some believe in a two-bag approach. They will place half of the remains of a torn document in one rubbish bag and the other half in a different trash container in the home (or, if you have a compost bin, mix part of it in with your compost). * Be sure to shred pre-approved and other credit offers (like when they send you blank checks) - don't just toss in the trash. Many thieves will use offers to apply for credit in your name at a different address, and will try to use any checks. Better yet, call your credit card companies and request that they not send cash advance checks in the first place. Phone the opt-out number to stop receiving credit card offers. 2. Protect your snail mail. The mail transports millions of pieces of personal information every day and is one of the most common sites for identity theft activity. A study found that the most frequently used non-technological method for identity theft was the rerouting of mail through change of address cards! So pay attention to your mail.center * Make sure you get all of your billing statements on time.

Find out if it is an addiction. Even if you have your earphones in all day every day, it still might not be an addiction; maybe you just enjoy music. Find out if it is an addiction. To do this, study how you behave when you're away from the music. Can you function properly or do you feel like something is missing? Signs of an addiction include: * Defensiveness. When someone calls you an addict, do you reply with statements such as ""I'm not addicted, it's just a hobby"", ""I can stop whenever I want to"" or ""I only keep my earphones in to drown you out"" when you know that these statements aren't true? * Blaming. Do you place the blame on other people to try and make yourself feel better? Do you blame your mother for shouting at you so much even though she hardly ever shouts? Do you blame school for being so boring even though you never listen in class? If you can't accept responsibility for your own actions, it might be an addiction. * Feeling guilty. If you feel guilty and shameful for allowing your problem to get so out of hand but you can't seem to stop, the problem may have become an addiction. If you don't feel guilty about your behavior, and can change it right away, then the problem probably isn't an addiction yet. * Isolation. Do you isolate yourself from others just so you can listen to music? Do you plug yourself in at parties and family gatherings so you won't have to talk to anybody? Convincing yourself that nobody wants to speak to you just so you have an excuse to put your earphones in may be another sign of an addiction. 2. Grab a pen and paper. If you're serious about quitting, you will need to seriously think about it. To do this, you should write down everything explained in the steps below. This way, if you find it hard to quit, you can read the paper and remember why you started trying in the first place. Sometimes, writing stuff down can also get the words you want to say out of your system without anybody criticizing you. 3. Consider why you listen to music. What about music draws you in so much that you find it hard to live without it? Maybe it shuts you off from the cruel world we live in. Maybe you find it hard to make friends or communicate. Maybe your music speaks the words you want to hear. Whatever the reason is, you need to figure it out. Write the reason down on your paper. It could also be more than one reason, scribble them all down too. 4. Run some tests. Now that you know why you listen to music, you need to know how long you listen to music. For the next full day (tomorrow or today if you're reading this very early), you will need to do some calculations. On your piece of paper, write down what time you woke up. Don't worry about quitting music just yet, listen to music as you normally would. Every time you remove your earphones, write down how long you removed them for, even if it's just a few seconds."	Do this for another day if you feel the first was inaccurate.

Consider Health Risk: If you are out of shape, have back problems, or a heart conditions, it may actually be dangerous for you to shovel. Hire a local teen or find a neighbor with a snowblower instead. 2. Use A Good Snow Shovel. A good shovel has a fairly long handle and is about three feet wide at the bottom. It should be constructed for snow removal, with no-stick surface and of light construction. Ergonomic shovels have a bend in the handle and are excellent. Use garden or other shovels only in a pinch. 3. Pick the Correct Shovel. There are two basic types. One is a digging shovel for high amounts of snow, and the other a pushing shovel for pushing low amounts of snow off of driveways, walkways, etc. 4. Dress Appropriately. You need to dress warmly, and gloves or mittens a must.	.

Take a Hebrew class. Whether it's at school, a community center, or even a personal tutor. Doing this will make you much more committed to learning the language as well as understanding it better. 2. Surround yourself with the language. Instead, listen to Israeli radio, buy/download music in Hebrew, read an easy book, etc. 3. If you're in Israel, it is highly recommended to buy one or two kids books. Disney has many books in Hebrew. Aladin and Hercules are two good choices. You can purchase these books in many locations. One convenient location is the book store in the central station in Jerusalem, you see the store when going up the escalators. 4. Learn how to do a throaty r and a khet, like in German. Also make your sounds short. 5. Use male and female. It's similar to French in how it is used for objects and changes the way the word sounds. Usually female ends with ""it"" or ""ah"" 6. Learn simple words and phrases such as: (Note that 'kh' and 'ch' are both transliterations of the throaty h, as the english ch sound does not exist in Hebrew) * Yom Huledet samayach - Happy Birthday * chaiim - Life * Besede'r - Fine * Sebaba - Cool - Fine * Boker tov - Good mornnig * kahyom tovim - how is it going-Yom means day * Mazal tov - Congratulations * Eema - mother * Ma shlomech? how are you? said to a female * Ma shlomcha? how are you? said to a male * Shalom - hello/goodbye/peace * Ma nishma - What's up? (m/f) * Korim li _ ' - my name is (literally, ""they call me"") * Ani ben (number) - I'm (number years) old if you're a male * Ani bat (number) - I'm (number years) old if you're a female * Ha Ivrit sheli lo col cakh tova - my Hebrew isn't very good * Ani meh _ - I'm from _ * Todah (rabah) - thank you (very much) * bevakasha - please/you're welcome * Eich korim lekha/lakh? - what's your name? (speaking to male/female) * Eifo atah gar?/ Eifo at garah? - where do you live? (m/f) * Eich omreem (word you are trying to say) beh'Ivrit? - How do you say (word) in Hebrew? 7. Learn the correct use of plural and singular. The plural for male ends with ""im"" and the plural for female ends with ""ot"". In verbs, the plurals end with ""oo"". There are a number of irregular verbs, however, and there is no formula to them. You just have to memorize them. 8. Use the male and female form of numbers: * ekhad(male),akhat(female) * shnayim(male),shtayim(female)['ay' pronounced like in 'buy'] * shlosha(male),shalosh(female) * arba'ah(male),arbah(female) * khamisha(male),khamesh(female) * shisha(male),shesh(female) * shiv'ah(male),sheva(female) * shmon'ah(male), shmonay(female) * tish'ah(male), tesha(female) * asarah(male), eser(female) 9. Understand that Hebrew is a complex Language: In english, verbs do not change very much: I ate, you ate, he ate, she ate, we ate, they ate. However, in Hebrew, almost every form of the verb is different based on who is being talked about and the tense. Take, for example, the word ""Ochel"", meaning eat: * (I) ate: achalti * (You singular for male): achalta * (You singular for female): achalt * (He): achal * (She): achla * (You plural for a group including even one male): achaltem * (You plural for a group of all females): achalten * (They): achlu 10."	Use a special dictionary of conjugation to help yourself, and don't worry. This is the part of Hebrew most people struggle with the most, and so this is the part most people make mistakes with, so you're not alone.

Only do one thing at a time. Focusing on more than one thing (multi-tasking) forces your mind to be scattered, this makes it easier for anxiety-producing thoughts to pop up. Being mindful means focusing on only one thing and focusing on that thing completely. * Often we multitask without even realizing it. For example, we eat lunch while checking email or talk on the phone while editing a report. * Think about what you are about to do before you do it, and then commit to doing just that activity. * Stop yourself when you find that you have started multitasking and return your focus to your one task. 2. Focus wholly on what you are doing.A major part of mindfulness is being absorbed in the present moment. If your mind is completely occupied with what you are doing, then there is less opportunity for anxiety-inducing thoughts to creep in. * When possible, reduce the number of distractions around you so that you can focus only on the task at hand. * When it is not possible to reduce distractions, be mindful of them, but don’t let them grab your attention. 3. Pay attention to sensations. Getting used to recognize your sensations while make it easier for you to be mindful of them during times of high anxiety and will decrease the number of anxiety-starting thoughts that you have on a regular basis. Be aware of what you see, hear, feel, taste, and smell. * For example, while cooking dinner, pay attention to the different textures and colors of the ingredients, the sounds of your cooking tools, the aromas that are produced, etc. * When brushing your teeth, notice how the toothpaste tastes and smells. How does the toothbrush feel in your hand? Pay attention to the feel of it on your teeth, tongue, and gums. 4. Be aware of your emotions. While you are performing your task, think about how performing it makes you feel. Think about how the sensations of the task make you feel. You will be able to better recognize and handle your emotions when you are anxious if you make a habit of being aware of them. * For example, when you are taking a walk, be aware of your sense of peace and calm. * Think about how the fresh air in your lungs makes you feel proud that you are taking care of your health. 5. Take your time.	Slowing down helps prevent anxiety by slowing your mind in general. It also gives you the opportunity to halt anxiety by fully focusing on what you are engaged in.

Understand the requirements. Get in touch with your campus Greek Life office. Once you have an idea for a fraternity and a decent pitch, you should go to the Greek Life office at your school and tell them your plans for starting a fraternity. Ask what they would like you to accomplish before they would be willing to recognize your fraternity. They might be resistant at first, so you’ll have to come in with a very concrete pitch and plan. Don’t wing it. Be very prepared. Of course, if you avoid branding yourself as a Greek-letter fraternity by adopting a non-Greek-letter name, you may be able to avoid these requirements entirely. * Come with details about name, values, and organization as well as a list of all the people you have gathered who are interested in it. The administration will be much more open to your idea if it is clear that you are on top of it. 2. Develop a strong pitch. Present your fraternity with confidence. Show everyone what hole in the campus culture you fill. Prove to them that you will be a positive influence. Don't try to develop a fraternity that is just like every other fraternity - that will make you redundant. However, you also shouldn't be so far out in left field that no one would want to join your group. * Your pitch should include all the aspects that you have organized so far including structure, constitution, name, mantra, regalia, and location. However, you also need to explain to them how your fraternity will survive moving forward and how they will fit into the daily life of the campus. What do you bring that no one else brings? Why will you succeed? * Draft a plan that starts by addressing the basics and then moves on to the details. For example, maybe you are selling a fraternity that is based on political activism. You need to explain not only the idea behind your fraternity but also how you will organize events centered on political activism and how this fits into the college's mission. 3. Affiliate with a national fraternity. If you want to affiliate with a national university you’ll have to get in touch with that fraternity and tell them you are interested in opening a chapter at your school. Let them know that you have established an interest group and ask them what the next steps will be. They can help guide you through the process. This is not necessary if you want to start a brand new independent fraternity. 4. Convince your university to recognize your fraternity. Once you have taken the steps that your Greek Life office has asked you to take, you can ask for recognition. This will allow you to throw campus events, advertise on campus, and be involved in school-sponsored events. Being recognized by the university is necessary if you want to add legitimacy to your fraternity. Remember, the better prepared you are and the more details you can show your administration the more likely they are to approve your fraternity.	"If you truly want a small group of close friends sharing common ideals, and aren't concerned about having a float in the official homecoming parade, keeping your organization ""unofficial"" and below the radar of your college's administration may be the better way to go."

Start_a_Farm.txt	Inside_Revision	0.809	## Steps	955	But be prepared for the unexpected .	### The End of the Beginning	6009	Be prepared for the unexpected .	<delete><But><1>|||<replace><be><2><Be><1>	True	Steps  1. Plan. Have a business plan or a operational plan down before you buy or start a farm. Make sure you have reviewed and written down your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, (also called a SWOT analysis). Also note where you are, and where you want to be, and how you want to get there. Additional personal and business goals and objectives, and financial and market goals and objectives are also important to note. * Before you go ahead and start farming, look at the farm you are looking to buy or inherit by looking at the lay of the land and the farm's weaknesses, strengths and areas of possible improvements. Draw out a map of the whole farm and where things are currently. If you wish, draw out another map of that same farm and draw in the layout of the farm of where you want it to be in the next 10 years of your farming business. 2. The land and climate. The land is the foundation of how, where, and what you farm. * Look at the topographical features, the contours and terrain of the land. * Study the soil, or have a soil sample tested to see what kind of soil you have that is either best for growing crops or for growing livestock. * Look at the native plants that grow around the farm, especially grasses if you plan on using the farm as a livestock enterprise. * Also talk to other farmers as well as the owner that is selling his land (if you are buying a farm rather than inheriting one from your parents or grandparents) for information on the kinds of crops that he grew on there (if he grew any), when he seeded, when he sprayed and when he harvested. If the land is only used for pasture, have a forage analysis done along with the soil test. * Go to the county extension office and see the different reports on the different climatic conditions that happened over the years for your area you will be farming in. * Only do this if you are not familiar with the location and before or after you have talked to the seller and some of the neighbors. 3. Capital. If the farm you are buying doesn't have the proper buildings on there already, planning and building may be required to make the farm you are taking over into one you have in mind. But sometimes many buildings may just need to be repaired if they are in need of it, and others may have to be taken down because they are decrepit and too old to be of any use to you. * If you are doing crop farming, make sure you have all the necessary machinery that is built to seed, care for and harvest the crops you are willing to sow and grow. Things like tractors are very important. * On the other hand, if you are buying a farm that raises livestock and you continue to raise livestock on there, buildings may also need to be looked at, as well as fences, handling facilities, water sources and facilities, and feeding facilities. Chances are you may want to change the layout of the current fencing areas, put in new fences, renovate pastures and/or create more wildlife habitat that has been degraded over the years due to mismanagement. 4. The end of the beginning. Know what crops are best for you to sow, and what fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides to use on that crop. Be prepared to be flexible and to learn as you go. As for livestock, now is a good time to purchase your animals. Make sure you start with good animals and not someone's crappy culls. Carry through with what you've been planning for and built up to now, as this will most likely what will make your business click. * Be responsible in choosing the animals you purchase. If you are getting a breeding herd, only one intact male per several females is optimum. For instance, a bull is able to easily service up to 50 cows or heifers at one time. A boar can be used to service 20 sows, and one ram or buck for 20 to 25 females. If you are starting with only a handful of cows, do not purchase one bull per cow! This also goes for all other breeding livestock. It is best to choose to AI the only 2 or 3 cows you buy or to lease a bull to service them. This also goes for pigs, sheep, goats, chickens, ducks, geese, horses, etc. *	Always review your business plan and make changes as needed as new ideas, new thoughts and new issues come up.

Jennifer likes to know that her skin is clear and rid of any spots, just like any one else. And to get the finished look before you have even started is to grab your concealer and dab (or smear) over places where foundation or spot treatment will not cure. This is an optional step however it gives you confidence to go through the whole day without foundation wearing off and being worried that the spot is visible. If you need this look to last all day, take a bag and keep a small concealer handy. 2. Foundation is also very handy to keep your skin clear or even just to add a bit of colour. Foundation is not the time to add colour to your face, this is a bit later on. Right now, focus on getting a shade lighter than your skin tone to get that natural look that Jennifer has. Never get a shade later, because many foundations develop or look darker in different shades, you don't want to look like a stick of butter. 3. As Jennifer is a natural pretty woman, she doesn't need bright and colourful eyeshadow so you won't need to apply a thick layer of it either. To get the eyeshadow to last, it is advised that you buy a eye primer to keep the shadow on the lid and it also prevents fall out. Now, for the shadow take an eyeshadow brush which is one of those puffy soft pads, and pat a beige colour on your lid and get as much coverage as you want. Then take a champagne colour and spread it over your crease and outer corner giving the feline effect but do not make it too visible as this is not what Jennifer has done. 4. Then with any mistakes take a cotton bud and use eye make up remover gel to squirt on the pad and go round the outline of the shadow and cover any mistakes. 5. Then take a decent eye lash curler and curl your eyelashes, tilt your eye lash curler on an angle so that it makes your eyelashes direct outwards. 6. Then take a thick brushed mascara with clump free label on it and brush it outwards, do lots of strokes as this makes a wispy effect. 7. Then use an eyebrow pencil / eyebrow kit with eye shadow to outline your eyebrows to give that soft look to your eyebrows, if you are looking to look like Jennifer Aniston then have a closer look at her eyebrows and follow the shape of them and maybe the colour if your eyebrows aren't too dark. Use an angled brush to do this. 8. Clear fallout with cotton bud again and fill in your eye shadow again and eye brows to prevent having gaps or lighter spaces in the eye area. 9. Now buy a wispy pair of eyelashes and glue them on to the closest part of your lash line and add a thin layer of eye liner to make your eyes pop! Make sure you leave the glue to get tacky before you apply, press down on your eyelashes in place for 10-15 seconds. This will make sure that the lashes are applied properly. When you open your eye look all around 5 times and then wiggle your eye lashes with tweezers to make sure they are to your standard. Once you are happy move on. 10. Now the eye area is covered and complete we can move back to skin. Bronzer. Now is the time to add colour to your face, as much colour as you want as long as you don't look like a pumpkin. To get the even look contour in the cheeks and in the temple area and then using the excess of the bronzer on the forehead and down the nose. You could even contour your nose using an angled brush again making your nose look thinner than it is. Contour using a powder brush. 11. Powder with a translucent colour that will just set the make up making it last longer and then put the powder and powder brush into your bag along with the concealer 12. Then add a light pink natural colour to your lips, making sure its gloss. If you are feeling adventurous try a lip gloss that plumps your lips like the soap and glory mother pucker. And add the lip gloss to your bag so you can top up on that. 13.	.

A doctor that says nothing more can be done just doesn't have the knowledge or experience to know what else can be done. But there are always something else that can be done if you ask a surgeon at a teaching hospital even if they don't know yet what it is. They will research and consult and research some more until they come up with the plan for care. they will be confident in their skills and your outcome from surgery and they will have so much better technology and staff available than any hometown hospital might have(unless it is a teaching hospital. they will assign a nurse to you that will handle all the details of beforehand testing and preparing you for your surgery and recovery, so don't worry about the details. Just keep notes and follow directions. The doctors in these hospitals are the best of the best. They will amaze you, let them work their magic. they can even fix bad outcomes from previous surgeries.These hospitals take Medicare and Medicaid happily so that's not an issue either. And ask as many questions as you have until you feel confortable. That's what makes for better outcomes too, when you know what to expect. 2. Be sure you have completed all pre-surgery testing necessary at least ten days ahead of out of town surgery to eliminate any need to postpone a surgery. And only have complex and invasive tests done at the recommended facility because some tests aren't familiar to your local providers and they may not even know what you are talking about in some instances. It may be inconvenient but just do it for best results.	If they suggest an acute rehab hospital after you leave their hospital, go there. An acute rehab hospital will teach you how to move without injuring yourself and improve your recovery too. Prepare yourself mentally for surgery surrounding yourself with good energy and positive thoughts.

Realize it’s never too late to reinvent yourself. No one is too old or too established to reinvent themselves. Change is a part of life and can be a positive thing if you use it correctly. Be prepared to grow and adapt at every stage of life. 2. Let go of the past. Ask yourself which aspects of your life are being influenced by past hurts, insecurities, and regrets. Once you identify those issues, commit to letting them go so that they no longer control who you are. * Write out the things that frustrate you, or that you think hold you back. Expressing your feelings can help you let go of anything unpleasant in your past. You can even tear up, throw away, or burn this list if you want a symbolic gesture of getting rid of negative aspects of your past. * Realize that whatever your regrets are, in some ways you are better off than others. Focus on your strengths and other positive things you take away from your past. 3. Learn from past mistakes. In order to reinvent yourself, it is important not to dwell too much on the past. However, there are often lessons you can take away from the past that can improve who you are in the present. *	Think about what you can do to prevent the same thing from happening in your next relationship.

Find tinder. Basically, anything that is dry, fibrous, and will take a spark, or ""catch"" and ignite should do (pocket lint, feather down, dried mosses, and finely ground leaves are examples). 2. Gather firewood. Gather several handfuls of kindling, typically tiny pieces of wood in various sizes, starting with some that are as thin or thinner than a toothpick, but longer; then several handfuls of wood about the thickness and length of a pencil; and lots and lots of wood bigger than this, up to about the thickness of your arm. Try not to use wood off the ground (it could be rotted, or damp), and avoid green wood unless absolutely necessary. See the Things You'll Need listed below. 3. Make a bow. Use slightly bendable wood for the bow. You'll be putting a lot of pressure on the bow, and dead wood is more likely to break than similarly sized green wood. Beginners should make a bow 1.5 to 2 feet long. Use as thin of wood as you can so the bow will be as light as possible. A lighter bow is easier to control, and takes less strenth to push back and forth. But it has to be stiff enough to not bend when you're using it. The bow doesn't actually have to have much of a curve to it. I've used bows made from sticks that are perfectly straight, and they work just fine. The hard part is figuring out how to best attach the shoelace (or whatever you use) to each end of the bow. It will have to have a little slack so that you can twist the drill into the bow. Once the drill is in the bow, the tension should be nice and firm. But that's getting a little ahead of things.  4. Make a fireboard. The fireboard and the drill both need to be some kind of light, dry, non-resinous wood. In reality, you should be able to make this work with any kind of wood, but the kind of friction you'd have to generate with two pieces of green wood or hardwood is enormous! The best wood for this won't have any sap, and will be light and soft enough to easily dent with your thumbnail without gouging. Shape whatever wood you choose into a piece about an inch think, 2-3 inches across, and at least twelve inches long. Set it aside for now.  5. Make a drill. Your drill can be made of the same kind of wood as the fireboard, or a different kind. Just as long as it doesn't have any pitch in it, is light and fairly soft. I prefer fat drills at least 1/2 inch thick. Other people prefer more narrow ones down to maybe 1/8 inch thick. If you're little and light, smaller drills are better. Start with a stick about as thick as your thumb or index finger. It should be at least eight inches long, and the straighter the better. I whittle my drills until they are perfectly straight and perfectly round. It makes life SO much easier! What will be the top end of the drill should be shaped like the end of a pencil, the bottom end should be a little more blunt. Take some time to get the drill just right. It will pay off.  6. Find or make a socket. Your socket can be made of bone, wood, or rock. If you're really lucky you'll find a rock that you can easily hold in your hand, and that has a nice smooth dimple in it that will take the pencil-sharp end of your drill. A fist-sized rock is better than a tiny one, as the friction can heat the thing up really fast if it's small. But you have to be able to hold it and control it. The deeper the dimple, the better. The smoother the sides of the dimple, the better. You're trying to avoid any and all friction between the socket and the drill. If you can't find a rock, the easiest to make is wood. It should be small enough for you to comfortably hold in your hand, but big enough that your fingers don't wrap all the way around it and touch the drill as it's turning. It is best to make it out of hardwood if possible, or use a knot in softwood as a naturally lubricated socket. Use the tip of a knife or sharp rock to drill a hole no more than halfway into the wood. Be very careful not to slip and cut yourself during this process! Of course, other things can be used as sockets. I knew somebody that used a little glass lip balm container as a socket. Basically, whatever you can find or fashion is fine.  7. Find a coal catcher. Last but certainly not least, you'll need something to catch the punk that's created, keep it insulated from the cold ground while it becomes a coal, and carry it from the ground to the tinder. This can be a dry leaf, sliver of wood, piece of paper, bark, etc. Whatever it is, make sure you can pick it up without fumbling around and dropping it. And make sure it's not going to burn through in the few seconds that the coal is going to be sitting on it.  8. Burn a hole. Here's where everything comes together. Notice that you haven't cut any notches in the fireboard yet. That's because you need to know where your drill in going to spin on the fireboard before you cut the notch. Take the fireboard and mark a spot about 1.5 times the drill's diameter from one of the fireboard's long edges. Dig a crater there about 1/4 inch deep and about as wide as your drill. Put the fireboard on the ground. (Reverse the following for lefties). Put your left foot on the fireboard about one inch to the left of the crater. The arch of your foot (not the ball or the heel) should be over the fireboard. Make sure the ground is pretty flat and that you don't put so much pressure on the fireboard that you break it. Kneel on your right knee. Make sure that your right knee is far enough behind your left foot that you make all 90 degree angles. (More about that later.) Hold the bow in your right hand, drill in your left. Put the drill on top of the string with the pencil-sharp end pointing right, and twist it into the bow. If it's too hard to do, loosen the string a bit. Put the blunt end of the drill on the crater. Put the socket on the drill. Grab as close to the end of the bow as you can. Put some downward pressure on the socket and start to pull back and forth on the bow. It's a delicate balance between putting too much and not enough pressure on the drill, and having the bow string too tight and not tight enough. Most likely something's going to go wrong, and I'll go through troubleshooting later. For now lets just assume you're amazing and things go right. You'll saw back and forth with the bow faster and faster, and put more and more pressure on the socket, and finally you'll get some black powder down around the bottom of the drill, and some smoke. Excellent! You've done just about everything but ""bust a coal"". Now stop and pick up the fireboard.  9. Cut a chimney Use your cutting device to make a V-shaped notch that reaches from the edge of the fireboard almost to the center of the hole you just burned in the fireboard. There's discussion as to whether a U-shape is better than a V-shape, and whether wider is better than narrower. The most important thing is to make sure that it's not so wide that when you start spinning the drill in the hole again, it just slips out thru the notch. About a ""sixth of a pie"" is good."	Like Goldilocks, you want it just right.

The most overwhelming and beautiful isle in your scrapbooking supply store is probably the paper isle. Scrapbooking paper comes in all colors of the rainbow and in too many designs to count. If there is an occasion to scrapbook, there is most certainly a paper to match your theme, but with all the choices, it is easy to leave the store with papers you will never use and without the kind you really need the most. 2. To prevent having to take out a second mortgage to buy paper, first decide what size album you will be making. Papers come in two standard sizes-8 1/2 x 11 and 12 x 12. You can also make albums in smaller sizes as well. Larger paper can be cut to size and smaller papers can be used for embellishments and matting, but you will need the most paper in the size of your album.	Scrapbooking safe paper comes in everything from thick cardstock to light velum and each type of paper has a specific use. You will probably use most of the medium-thickness paper.

Work with a lawyer. There are many wrinkles to Chapter 13 which cannot be addressed in this article. Furthermore, the Chapter 13 process is incredibly confusing. People who file without the help of a lawyer are rarely successful. In fact, one district court in California calculated that fewer than 1% of all applicants are successful when they file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy without a lawyer. * Accordingly, you should treat this article as for information purposes only and get a referral to a bankruptcy lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association. * Call up the lawyer and schedule a consultation. Ask how much it will cost to do the Chapter 13 from start to finish. Often, lawyers will charge a flat fee to handle a bankruptcy. * Remember that you can spread out your lawyer’s fees over the length of your repayment, which will be 3-5 years. 2. Identify and add up priority debts. Priority debts will be paid first in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy before all other debts are paid. You should identify and then calculate how much you owe of the following: * back alimony and child support * taxes owed to the state and federal government * contributions to your employee’s benefit fund * money owed to your employees, such as salaries, wages, and commissions 3.

Take daily warm baths or showers. When you have eczema, a good skin care routine includes having a daily warm (not hot) shower or bath. While in the bath or shower, use a mild soap or a non-soap alternative to cleanse your skin. Apply a good moisturizer all over your entire body immediately after your bath or shower, while your skin is still damp. * Keep the length of your showers and baths to 10-15 minutes at the most. * Avoid using a washcloth, sponge, loofah, or other exfoliating items when you wash your skin. * Apply any medicated lotions before your overall moisturizer within 3 minutes of getting out of the water. * It may be helpful to conduct your daily shower or bath at night, instead of in the morning, so your skin has a better chance of absorbing moisture from the water and moisturizer. 2. Moisturize your skin every day. If you have eczema, your skin is having trouble retaining moisture.	In addition to moisturizing immediately after a bath or shower, moisturize your skin several times throughout the day.

It might be that you lack containers or places to put your items in an organized way. 2. Make important decisions first. Recognize the decisions you need to make and how they will contribute to solving your problem. Making decisions can help you move forward in solving your problems, so start by deciding on what to focus on, what needs to get done, and how you will go about doing it. * For example, you might have several problems to solve and need to decide which ones to tackle first. Solving one problem may ease tension or take stress off of another problem. * Once you make a decision, don’t doubt yourself. Be willing to look forward from that point on without wondering what would have happened had you chosen something else. 3. Simplify the problem. An overly-complicated problem can feel overwhelming and be difficult to solve. If there are multiple problems, break them down into smaller parts and deal with them individually. If you can break the problem down into the smallest terms, this will help you in understanding it and finding a solution. * For example, if you need to turn in many assignments to pass a class, focus on how many you have to do and approach them one by one. 4. Organize information. Figure out what you know and what you don’t know. If you have access to more information, seek it out. Inform yourself of all possible information, then organize it in a meaningful way. * For example, if you’re trying to pass a cumulative test, gather all of your notes and organize them so that you can reference them easily. 5. Allocate your resources. Your resources may include time, money, effort, travel, etc. If solving the problem is a top priority, you may need to allocate more resources toward solving the problem than you otherwise would. Think about what resources you have that you can give toward solving your problem. * For example, if you have a deadline, you may skip cooking dinner or going to the gym so that you can give that time to your project. 6. Manage your emotions. Many problems are difficult to solve because feelings are often involved. Decide whether you want to make the decision based off of your emotions, your rationality, or a mix of both. If you’re prone to emotionally responding to problems then regretting it (for example, eating when you feel sad or snapping at someone if you’re in a bad mood), regulate your emotions before approaching the problem. *	.

Check the side effects of your medications. If you're taking a medication for another health condition, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, insomnia may be one of the side effects. * If you're having trouble sleeping and think your medication may be to blame, tell your doctor about it. They may be able to alter your dose or put you on a different medication that will still treat your medical condition without disturbing your sleep. 2. Talk to your doctor about medical conditions. Some medical conditions, such as gastro-intestinal disorders, can also cause insomnia or disordered sleeping patterns. Once the condition is treated, your sleep problems should go away. * Be sure to tell your doctor about your sleep problems, and let them know that you believe the medical condition is interfering with your sleep. This information may play a role in how your doctor chooses to treat your condition. 3. Participate in a sleep study. If your sleep is disrupted because of snoring or other problems, you may have a sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome. These disorders are more common in older adults. * To diagnose a specific sleep disorder, you'll have to undergo at least one sleep study. Your general practitioner should be able to refer you to a sleep clinic for a sleep study and further testing. * Based on the results of the sleep study and other information about your general medical condition, you may be prescribed behavioral therapy, medications, or other treatments to help you sleep better. 4. Talk to a mental health professional. As you age, you may confront a number of challenges that can cause stress or lead to mental disorders, such as depression. If you have recently had to deal with something traumatic, such as the death of a loved one, this may disrupt your sleep. * Getting therapy or simply talking to a professional can help ease anxiety and other symptoms that may be causing you to lose sleep or have difficulty falling asleep. * The mental health professional also may prescribe you medication for your mental condition, which could alleviate your sleep problems.	.

Acclimate your guineas. Your guineas will need a little time to get used to their new home before you allow them to roam free. Keep them in the coop for at least one week. Once they've acclimated, they will most likely return to their home, so you can let them roam. * Even if your guineas fly away at first, they will more than likely return home to roost at night. * To help get your guineas accustomed to returning home at night, feed them in their shelter in the evenings. 2. Offer food and water. Guinea fowl are very easy to feed, although their dietary needs will depend upon whether you keep them penned or allow them to roam and forage. * When allowed to roam, guinea fowl will eat all sorts of critters in your yard, including ticks, grasshoppers, spiders, and small snakes. You don't need to provide them with any additional food, except some mixed grains in their shelter at night if you want to encourage them to spend the night there. * If you keep your guineas penned, feed them store-bought chicken feed (one pound per day for every six guineas). To increase egg production, switch them to a higher protein feed formulated for turkeys and wild fowl in February, which is just before the beginning of egg laying season. * Your guineas will also rely on you to provide a constant source of fresh water. You can buy a waterer for poultry, which holds a large amount of water and dispenses it little by little into a small dish. Keep in mind that it will need to be heated to keep the water from freezing if you live in a cold climate. 3. Collect eggs. Because guineas roam free, they can build their nests and lay their eggs almost anywhere.	Once you've identified a nest, wait for the bird to leave and gather some eggs.

Make a list of utility accounts. This will likely include electric, gas, heating, cooling, water, sewer and trash removal. This may also include internet, phone, and cable. Write down each service, the name of your provider, and the telephone number. This will help ensure that you cover all of your bases, and that no utility gets mistakenly left out. 2. Gather account info. When you call each company, they are going to need some information from you. In most instances, this will include some kind of account number, as well as your home address. In some cases, you may also need to provide a password, or other personal information (such as a social security number) to verify your identity. Gather this information before you call. 3. Make sure you are not violating a contract. Some companies (often internet providers, for example) require you to sign a contract at the time of installation. Before you call to cancel, it is a good idea to figure out where you stand with your contract. If you will be violating your contract, you may be charged a steep fee. If this is the case for you, look into transferring your service to your new home. 4. Consider a transfer of service. Particularly with media services (like phone, internet, and cable) it is relatively easy to transfer your service to your new home (as long as your provider offers service in that area).	Before you cancel your service, determine whether or not any of your accounts will qualify for a transfer. (You can do this by calling each company and inquiring). Often, they can simply use your existing deposit and personal information, making the process of moving much more smooth.

Have a game plan for what to do after you quit. Once you've decided that you're absolutely sure you'll quit your job, you should make a bullet-proof game plan so you don't get left in the lurch after you quit your job. Ideally, you should quit your job only after you've found another job because it'll be harder to find another job as an unemployed candidate. * Don't assume that you can just ""make it work"" until you find another job. In today's economy, you might be unemployed longer than you imagined. Don't quit your job in the heat of the moment and just assume that you can figure it out after the fact. * Line up another job before leaving. You should spend some time on the job market as you try to leave your current job. You shouldn't be dishonest about the fact that you currently have a job when you speak to potential employers. * If you don't have another job lined up, make sure you have enough money to be unemployed. If you really can't stand your job, tap into a savings account so that you can leave earlier. This means that you will have to budget until you can find another job. When saving up, plan for an extended period of being unemployed just to be safe. * When you do leave your job, make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. Don't just quit because you feel undervalued or underpaid before having a conversation with your employer about it first. If you don't try to solve the problems at your current job to the best of your ability, then you may face the same problems at your new job. 2. Give two weeks notice. This is the respectful thing to do. Remember that the company is relying on you and will have to fill a hole as soon as you leave. If the company has a policy for having to give notice earlier than two weeks, then respect that policy. *"	.
Select_a_Cavalier_King_Charles_Spaniel.txt	Inside_Revision	0.627	### Deciding on a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel	2673	However , Cavaliers rarely have their coats trimmed and they generally only require bathing every couple of weeks .	### Deciding on a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel	2761	Cavaliers rarely have their coats trimmed and they generally only require bathing every couple of weeks .	<delete><However><1>|||<delete><,><2>	True	"Deciding on a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel  1. Figure out if you are mature enough for a Cavalier. Above all, are you able to be patient with a dog and not lose your temper when he does something wrong? Will you put time into training your dog? Will you prioritize your dog's needs? Only if you can honestly answer yes to all of the above, then consider getting a dog. Owning a dog is not a right, and only those who can commit to providing the physical and emotional needs of the pet should consider getting a dog. 2. Evaluate your finances. Getting a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, just like with any pet, requires financial commitment. Are you ready to commit to a dog? There are many things to consider before you decide to purchase a Cavalier. * Do you have sufficient income to pay for a dog? Expect to spend between $500 and $3,500 for a purebred Cavalier puppy. * More importantly, consider the daily costs associated with owning a Cavalier. Cavaliers need to go to the groomer on a regular basis for baths and, on occasion, trims. Dogs require food, water, a place to run around, and trips to the veterinarian for preventative health care such as vaccinations and parasite treatments. What if you need to travel and cannot take your furry friend? You’ll need to be able to afford kennel fees. 3. Determine if you have enough time to spend with your new dog. Cavaliers, like all dogs, need a lot of attention, so one of the worst things you can do is adopt a dog and leave it at home alone all the time. Determine your ability and commitment to spending time with your dog. Cavalier Spaniels are indoor dogs that were traditionally bred as lap dogs. They become quite attached to their ""people companions"" and do not tolerate being left alone for extended periods of time well. If your pet will be alone often, particularly as a puppy, consider choosing a breed that has less separation anxiety than a Cavalier. * Does your work schedule allow you to take the dog for twice daily walks and not to leave the dog from more than 4 hours (a puppy) or 8 hours (an adult) at a time? Can you commit to thoroughly grooming your dog twice a week? 4. Think about Cavaliers' exercise needs. Cavaliers are small dogs that will not require as much room to run as a large breed like a Golden Retriever. However, they are energetic spaniels who love to play and explore the out-of-doors. Individuals considering this breed should be prepared to provide regular exercise to keep their Cavalier healthy. For athletic owners, Cavaliers can gradually be trained to accompany you on long walks or hikes. 5. Decide if a Cavalier fits your needs. Some people get dogs for guarding or work purposes. Cavaliers are not good at either. They are primarily lapdogs that provide entertainment and comfort. * Cavaliers can be great for families with young children. Because of their small stature, there is less chance that your children will be hurt accidentally - as is often the case with large lumbering Labradors. Cavaliers can still bite and scratch, but in general they are easy breeds to handle. 6. Consider common Cavalier health issues. Because most people want pure-bred Cavaliers, this means that many of them have illnesses. They have been bred from a limited gene pool. The resulting inbreeding has the very real and extremely unfortunate consequence of making certain diseases very common in the Cavalier breed. Pure-bred Cavaliers run a high risk of suffering from heart disease, disc disease, and/or a severe neurological issues. * Heart disease: In the UK, 59% of Cavaliers over the age of 4 years old have a heart murmur. At nearly two-thirds of the UK's population of Cavaliers, this is an extraordinary statistic. The sad thing is that a great number of these dogs will develop heart failure as they age. * Chiari malformation and Syringomyelia: This condition has become more widely understood since the advent of sophisticated imaging techniques such as MRI and CT scans. This condition means the brain case is too small to fit the brain in, and as a result the hind part of the brain is squeezed by the back of the skull. This causes dreadful nerve pain. The veterinary textbook ""Breed Predispositions to Disease in the Dogs and Cats"" lists this condition as ""very common"" with signs developing between 5 months to 3 years of age. * Epilepsy: Dogs may develop seizures at any time, but between 6 months to 6 years is the most common time * Disc disease: This is another ""common"" condition, especially as Cavaliers age. Unfortunately, disc disease can be silent, and you only know there is a problem when a disc catastrophically slips out of place - in worst case scenario, the disc slips and the dog loses the ability to walk with its back legs. There are several signs that a dog has a bad back. These include walking stiffly, being reluctant to jump up, or holding its head and neck in a stiff manner with a general reluctance to lower its head to its food or water bowl. * Consider the costs of diagnosis and treatment. For heart disease, this involves blood tests and heart scans, and for neurological complaints, MRI or CT scans will be needed. Add to the cost of investigation, the expense of ongoing medications and your pet could become very costly indeed. 7. Think about grooming. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels have luxurious silky coats and come in four different color combinations known as Blenheim (chestnut red and white), Black and Tan, Tricolor (chestnut red, white and black) and Ruby (solid chestnut red). Their coats benefit from regular brushing to distribute the oils in their coats and keep them tangle free."	.

Draft a formal business plan. Especially if you're self-financing your small farm business, you may think a formal business plan isn't necessary. However, a formal business plan can help you start to think of your farm as a business and treat it seriously. * Rely on your market research to come up with profitability predictions. Keep in mind it typically takes small farms several years to get off the ground. * If you plan on running your farm as a side-business or a hobby farm, a business plan can still help you organize the finances for your farm and keep it from taking over your personal funds. 2. Go over your plans with an advisor. Once you've finished your business plan, have a business startup or financial advisor critique it and offer suggestions to improve. Look for someone who has extensive experience working with successful small farm businesses. * Check with your local FSA office, the state university's agricultural extension, or a regional farm group if you're having a hard time finding a good advisor. Staff at any of those locations typically can provide a strong, local recommendation or two. 3. Choose your small farm's business structure. When you're starting out, you have the choice to run your small farm business as a sole proprietorship, and LLC, or a corporation. The form you choose depends on your business goals and the level of personal risk you want to assume. * If you organize your business as a sole proprietorship, your farm is not separate from you and your personal finances in any way. This means that if you get into a dispute with a distributor, they can sue you personally.	.
Stop_Recurring_Boils.txt	Begin_Revision	0.846	### Understanding Boils	2043	If the boil is on your face	### Understanding Boils	2123	The boil is on your face	<delete><If><1>|||<replace><the><2><The><1>	True	Understanding Boils  1. Notice the symptoms of boils. Boils are bump-like manifestations on the skin. The symptoms include: * A firm, typically red bump on the skin * Tenderness at the sight of the bump, which is sometimes extreme * Swelling * When it is advanced, a boil can disappear on its own or increase in size. When they increase in size they become abscesses and are of significant concern, both medically and cosmetically. If it increases in size, it will eventually form a head, which means that underneath the top surface, the skin becomes filled with pus. * It can break open, draining and oozing pus, which is a mixture of blood cells, bacteria and fluids 2. Recognize the kind of boils. When you notice the symptoms of a boil, you may need to figure out which boil you have. A boil is a common form of a medical condition called an abscess which is a collection of pus underneath the dermis (the layer of skin under the epidermis). There are a number of different types of boils that you may contract. These include: * Furuncles, which occur in hair follicles. They are associated with a fever and chills and can become chronic. * Carbuncles, which are generally larger than furuncles and can also become chronic. They can also form hardened lumps under the skin. * Cystic acne, which is both a type of acne and a type of boil associated with more severe forms of acne. * Hidradenitis suppurativa, which is an inflammatory condition of the sweat glands. It occurs when there are multiple boils cropping up under the arms and along the groin area. It is also resistant to antibiotics and may require surgery to remove the affected sweat glands. * Pilonidal cysts, which result from inflamed hair follicles at the top of the buttock crease. Pilonidal cysts are uncommon, can occur after long periods of sitting, and occurs more in men than women. 3. Know the causes and placement of boils. There are multiple things that can cause boils. They are the result of an infection from the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus most commonly, though other fungi and bacteria can be found in the boils. Boils can be found anywhere on the body; however, they are most commonly found on the face, armpit, neck, inner thighs, and buttocks. 4. Learn the risk factors. Boils can happen to anyone at any time. The common bacteria that causes boils is very common on nearly everyone’s skin, so it is possible for almost anyone to get it from that. There are also some other factors that can increase your risk. These include: * Coming into close contact with someone close who has a boil or a Staph infection. If you are around someone with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), take extra precautions, as this can colonize on your body and increase your risk of serious infection. * Diabetes, which can suppress the immune system and lead to more infections. Due to the increase in blood sugar, microbes are more likely to colonize and infect a person with diabetes. If you have a boil and are diabetic, seek out medical attention immediately. * Any condition resulting in a suppressed immune system, such as HIV or cancer. * Other skin conditions that weaken the barrier capabilities of the skin, such as psoriasis, eczema, acne. or other condition where the skin is dried or broken 5. Treat the boils medically. Boils diagnosed in most cases by their appearance. There are a few different ways to treat them. Once they are diagnosed by your doctor, you can have them lanced, which is when the doctor pokes a hole in the head, or pus-filled head, of the boil and drains the pus. * In some cases, your doctor may also prescribe antibiotics. which can be topical or oral. This is usually reserved for large boils or those that last longer than two or three weeks. * If the boils are on your face or spine, are particularly painful, are associated with a fever, more treatment may be necessary. 6. Seek medical care. In rare occasions, the infection from a boil can spread, causing infections in the brain, heart, bones, blood, and spinal cord. Because of this, any suspected boils should not be ignored, especially if they are recurring. See your doctor if any remedies or treatments recommended do not help within two weeks. Also call your doctor if: * You are running a fever * The boil is very painful or limits movement or sitting *	.

Notice the symptoms of boils. Boils are bump-like manifestations on the skin. The symptoms include: * A firm, typically red bump on the skin * Tenderness at the sight of the bump, which is sometimes extreme * Swelling * When it is advanced, a boil can disappear on its own or increase in size. When they increase in size they become abscesses and are of significant concern, both medically and cosmetically. If it increases in size, it will eventually form a head, which means that underneath the top surface, the skin becomes filled with pus. * It can break open, draining and oozing pus, which is a mixture of blood cells, bacteria and fluids 2. Recognize the kind of boils. When you notice the symptoms of a boil, you may need to figure out which boil you have. A boil is a common form of a medical condition called an abscess which is a collection of pus underneath the dermis (the layer of skin under the epidermis). There are a number of different types of boils that you may contract. These include: * Furuncles, which occur in hair follicles. They are associated with a fever and chills and can become chronic. * Carbuncles, which are generally larger than furuncles and can also become chronic. They can also form hardened lumps under the skin. * Cystic acne, which is both a type of acne and a type of boil associated with more severe forms of acne. * Hidradenitis suppurativa, which is an inflammatory condition of the sweat glands. It occurs when there are multiple boils cropping up under the arms and along the groin area. It is also resistant to antibiotics and may require surgery to remove the affected sweat glands. * Pilonidal cysts, which result from inflamed hair follicles at the top of the buttock crease. Pilonidal cysts are uncommon, can occur after long periods of sitting, and occurs more in men than women. 3. Know the causes and placement of boils. There are multiple things that can cause boils. They are the result of an infection from the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus most commonly, though other fungi and bacteria can be found in the boils. Boils can be found anywhere on the body; however, they are most commonly found on the face, armpit, neck, inner thighs, and buttocks. 4. Learn the risk factors.

Don't think that suicide is the answer to everything. Suicide is one of the worst ways that we can deal with our problems. There are other ways to cope with a certain situation other than just killing ourselves. 2. Don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many people out there who deal with people like us every day of their lives. They are there because they want to help us, not make us feel even more miserable. It may seem like there is nobody in this world who can help you, but that's probably because you're not letting them help you. If you tell your friends how you're feeling then they are guaranteed to help you out. That is, if you let them. It's understandable that you may not want anyone's help, and that's completely alright. But you can't just keep having that thought linger in your mind forever. 3. If the cause of your thoughts is from a relationship, do not attempt to make the other person feel bad by saying that you want to commit suicide. This may seem like one of the best ways in order to get somebody to love you, but in reality, it isn't. Making somebody feel guilty or trying to get them to regret leaving you is not going to make anything better. They may end up getting back together with you, but you have to think to yourself, ""Is it really because s/he loves me? Or is it because s/he knows that if s/he doesn't take me back that I'll kill myself.."" If true love is really meant to happen between you both, then it will happen."	It will be difficult, but the best thing that you can do is to move on in life.

Start your day with an apple: It might not seem much, but it's easy and heathy. One apple is the best food you can have for breakfast. Try to have at least 6 apples somewhere in your room. Keep them at a low temperature level, and make them a mixture of red, green, and yellow; After all, eating only one type each day will make you hate it later. 2. Take the hard way: If your class is next to where you are staying, try to take the longest and hardest way to get there. Take the biggest number of stairs at morning. This will becomes your daily morning workout! 3. Stay away from fast food. Fast food is the easiest and fastest way to have lunch. However, you must avoid it completely! The first time, it will be a onetime thing in your head... but long behold till it becomes THE thing. You will be stuck in the greasy fat life of fast food forever. So you might want to avoid that from the beginning. 4. Avoid soda or alcoholic drinks. You are young, but in college you are in a very sensitive place in which any mistake will help in shaping the body you will have later in your life. So if you want to stay fit, try to replace soda with juice or diet drinks. If you are afraid to be embarrassed in front of your friends, say that it’s hurting your stomach these days. And if you must drink with them, make sure you have a lot of water and exercise later that day. 5. Eat real food. Whether you're at college dining hall or out and about off campus, you must choose carefully what you eat. Stay away from greasy food, no matter how much hungry you are.	In other words: do not order some ridiculously expensive or greasy meal that is enough for three people.

For dinner, make chicken and rice. Chicken isn't too expensive, and rice is cheap and lasts a long time too. For in between snacks, eat a banana, apple, or some nuts.

This is the name people will remember (or forget, if you choose a poor group name), the name you'll be endlessly promoting, and hopefully the name that will make you famous. Think about what your group's name says about your style, your personalities, and how it fits with the kind of songs you want to sing. 3. Practice. Start by doing covers of popular songs that everyone in the band likes. Work out all the details, perfect your parts, and see what happened. You should spend many, many hours practicing to make sure everything will be perfect when you actually start performing in front of people. 4. Find a manager.

Call local venues. Find out what clubs/bars/restaurants/venues have live music and ask how you would go about being considered for this gig. The venue might ask that you send them a demo tape or to come audition for them live. Whatever they ask, make sure you take your time to prepare and present your group's best image. 2. Play at parties in your area. Ask your friends and neighbors if you can perform at parties they might be throwing. The more you get your group out there where people can hear you, the better. Even if it is just at a small neighborhood party, it is still better for your group than not performing at all. 3. Participate in local talent shows. See if your community has a local talent show of any kind and sign up. This is a great way for you to become involved in the community, to get your music heard by a variety of people, and to open the door for new opportunities for your group. Many now famous bands and musicians(like Rhianna and Usher) got their start performing in small, local talent shows. 4. Make fliers. Whenever you have an upcoming performance, make fliers and post them around your town, especially in high traffic areas. Make sure the fliers are exciting and attention-grabbing so that more people will take the time to look at them. 5. Promote online. Just a few years ago, people had no choice but to promote themselves by word of mouth alone.	Use the internet to your advantage and actively promote your group on popular social media platforms like FaceBook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Having an online presence makes it easier for your fans to find you, for people to contact you about booking gigs, and to put your music out there for people to hear.

Learn what menopause is. Menopause is just a time period which covers the first 12 month period where a woman has no periods. After that year has passed, a woman is postmenopausal. Before that, when she begins going through the menopausal process, is called perimenopause. The process of menopause can take a number of years. * In the perimenopausal time, a woman’s ovaries begin to decrease the production of the reproductive hormones, estrogen and progesterone. The average age when the last period occurs is 51 years. However, women can begin the perimenopausal time anywhere from two to 15 years prior to that. * Menopause can also occur after a total hysterectomy, after some forms of cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and as a result of primary ovarian insufficiency. 2. Recognize the symptoms of menopause. Menopause has common symptoms. However, the list of symptoms that women experience is extensive and often very individual. Women go through a number of different changes in the perimenopausal period, and the symptoms may vary depending on a large number of factors. No matter your symptoms, you can find relief. It may be as simple as using exercise to deal with hot flashes to using lubricants to help with painful intercourse. The most common symptoms during perimenopause are: * Irregular periods * Vaginal dryness * Hot flashes * Night sweats * Sleep problems * Mood changes * Weight gain and slowed metabolism * Thinning hair and dry skin * Loss of breast fullness * Many of these symptoms can indicate thyroid problems, which is one of the most underdiagnosed conditions in women.

Create a separate email account to keep track of coupons and sales. Grocery stores and retail outlets often ask for your e-mail at the register or ask you to enter your e-mail when you sign up for a loyalty card. Do not use your regular e-mail, but instead create a separate address specifically to track sales. * Stores often e-mail coupons and reminders about in-store specials, but such e-mails may inadvertently get filed to a spam or promotions folder in your inbox. You may also overlooked or delete these e-mails if they're mixed in with your regular messages. * Create a separate e-mail address to give out to retailers and check that e-mail before a big shopping trip. This is an easy way to make sure you see any e-mails related to store specials. If your new e-mail has a promotions filter, always check that. Check the spam filter as well, as sometimes coupons are accidentally filtered as spam by certain e-mail providers. 2. Plan weekly meals around what's on sale. Meal planning is a great way to save money as you end up only shopping once a week and avoid eating out.	.

For example, if a DRM WMA or DRM WMV you downloaded from WMP(windows media player) that has windows DRM, you can only play it back on a compatible device, so if every piece of music had windows DRM on it you would need to buy the same track on CD to listen in your CD player or car, as an iTunes download to play on your iPod, as a ms store download to play on your Zune etc, but since you paid for it once you shouldn’t be forced to pay for it again and again and again, remove windows DRM and you can play it on your phone, iPod, Zune, PSP, CD player, pc, and anything else that you can listen to music on. 2. How to remove DRM from windows WMV and WMA? 3. I got a few methods listed below: 4. 1.Burn and rip 5.

Switch up the outfit every time to keep it fresh. Try different hairstyles and makeup combinations to compliment your sexy look. *	While you may not go out and buy a skimpy lace or leather thong, your partner probably has a preference when it comes to your pre-sex attire.

Be ready to do well on the test. You worked hard for it, and you probably know a lot more than you think. * If you feel your eyelids drooping: pinch yourself, rub your face with a piece of ice, stand up, run in place, and do a few jumping jacks to get an adrenaline rush, or, if at worst, take a ten minute nap. Be careful with naps! (See below for how to nap in an all-nighter.) * Napping: Take them for about ten minutes. Set a loud timer to wake you up, and stay half-awake. Short naps refresh you. Anything longer and you'll fall into a deep stage of sleep, which will leave you groggy when you are forced awake. * Cold air keeps you awake and so does cold water or ice. * Work with good lighting. You don't want anything too bright, but too dim and you'll doze. * Don't nap! Eat high-protein foods on an infrequent basis through the night: smoothies, cheese, a sandwich, a plate of stew will all keep your energy levels as high as they are during the daytime. * If you can't skip the caffeine, don't stop drinking it till you have time to crash. * If you are using Microsoft Word, you can set the screen to blue with white text in the Tools > Options > General menu. This helps reduce eye strain. * If it can be helped, never pull an all nighter.

Keep your eyeglasses clean. Before driving, always make sure your eyeglasses are clean. Use soap and water to remove dirt, grime and debris from the lenses. Finish cleaning your lenses by drying them with a soft microfiber cloth. 2. Look into anti-reflective coating. If you wear glasses, ask your optometrist about anti-reflective (AR) coating. AR coating is an ultra-thin film made from silicon and zircon. The film is used to reduce internal reflection and transmit more light, improving your vision during the night. 3. Try to avoid looking straight into the headlights of oncoming traffic. Instead, avert your eyes when oncoming traffic approaches. Do this by looking down and to the right. Focus on the white line on the side of the road, or the pavement until the car passes. * As you do this, you will still be able to see other cars around you with your peripheral vision. 4. Get an eye check-up regularly. Having difficulty seeing and other medical problems associated with the eyes can exacerbate glare while driving at night.	This way you can catch and correct any eye problems to avoid vision problems while driving at night.

Confirm your symptoms. Make sure you're sure of your symptoms before you're sure. If you've been in sneezing fits and all of the sudden you have a headache, it might just be something you ate. To confirm your symptoms, make sure you've had them for awhile, and they will most likely won't go away soon. 2. If your symptoms match the symptoms below, then you probably have a cold. But if you haven't already, it would be recommended to see your docter to make sure it isn't allergies or a sinus infection, or even asthma. * runny or stuffy nose * sore throat * mild tiredness * headache or body ache * cough * slight fever (note that fevers usually take place in children) * sneezing 3. Treating the cold is simple. Make sure you stay home the first three days, because it's usually contagious during that range.	Finally, colds clear up within a few days. But fluids can help quicken the process. You should see your doctor if it isn't over in a week.

Run_a_Business_Spiritually.txt	Begin_Revision	0.931	## Steps	87	so make sure that you look after yourself well and find time for yourself .	## Steps	118	Make sure that you look after yourself well and find time for yourself .	<delete><so><1>|||<replace><make><2><Make><1>	True	Steps  1. Analyse the idea that money is evil. Most spiritual people hold on to a notion that money or success are bad and therefore should be avoided, the problem with this is that it leads to never having enough or having money struggles. remember always that there is a joy in wealth, a joy in financial security, a joy in debtlessness and a joy in owning. all of these things are spiritual in themselves and so can be thought highly of. 2. Delight in the joy of others, whilst remaining sensible and joyful yourself. Through delighting in the joy of others you realize many ways in which you can offer a service to them which in turn leads to financial success and through remaining sensible and joyful yourself you make sure that you carry on making good decisions and handle people well. through focusing on others joy you can create a dynamic that is not entirely about the money. 3. Delight in doing yourself favours. Much success comes from simply delighting in doing yourself favours because you begin to identify things that would benefit you and be of use and value and have a constant energy to go and do them. 4. Find ways to make your business sustainable. Quite frankly a business that is not sustainable will not survive for long, by finding ways to reduce the wastefulness of your business, be it recycling or otherwise on a small and large scale you create a sustainable environment within your business that can allow it to continue to flourish. 5. Have good ethics. All of your publics: customers, business partners, advertisers and so on will not want to do business with you if you practice without any morals and having good morals gives you strong disposition in making deals. think of the following. * do not steal or allow yourself to be stolen from. * do not cheat or allow yourself to be cheated * do not take negative advantage of others or allow others to take negative advantage of you. * do not rip people off or allow yourself to be ripped off * do not exploit others or allow yourself to be exploited. * do not make promises you cannot keep. 6. keep good company, both in your personal life and in your business life. keep contacts of other business owners, and begin to keep a book of contacts. these contacts allow you many opportunities and advice and allow you to do favours for others. by keeping good company in your personal life you stay motivated and in sight of what is important. 7. Encourage creativity in your business. The more creative people there are in your business the easier it will be to solve problems most creative people find ways to even make problems into a solution. 8. As well as making the business operational make sure that it is for humans - do not neglect aesthetics, values or brilliance in the making. For instance you may wish to have a calligrapher write meaningful poems onto the walls that promote a joyful and sensible environment. Or have a graffiti artist paint a beautiful mural on the wall symbolic of greatness. 9. Respect people, and be mindful of how you are treating them. A business works because because of the people involved. Through developing mindfulness of people you become aware of many of the mistakes that people make and many of the struggles that they face. As a result they are more included in the company and more willing to do what they can for it. 10. Keep everyone involved in the company inspired. Through inspiration comes motivation and energy. And from this comes a drive for success. If you are able to transfer the reasons and goals of the company successfully they will want to work and do their best because they will enjoy it. 11. Pay attention to everything. Ignorance and business do not mix well and the more you pay attention the less ignorant you become. Be conscious of your own suffering and stress so that you do not fall into disaster, many people just let themselves go until they break down and cannot work anymore. 12. Keep yourself fit and healthy. Many people they work and work and work and work and never find time for themselves. But if you do not take care of yourself then your work will suffer also. A human being needs exercise and play as well as work in order to function.	.

Hot water can damage the color and weaken the fibers, and cold water will not remove the dirt or hair products. * These special wig shampoos and conditioners can be found in person at wigs stores and some hair salons, or online with large retailers like Amazon or Wal-Mart. 3. Place your wet wig on a towel over a flat surface to air dry. You want your wig to dry completely before storing it away. Any sealed moisture could lead to mold growing on your wig. * Don’t hang, blow dry, or place the wet wig in direct sunlight as this can stretch the cap and damage the fibers. 4. Comb and detangle your dry wig, starting at the ends. Small knots or tangles left for long periods of time, can damage or even break the wig fibers.	Start combing the ends of the wig first, and work your way up to the roots. This will keep the wig from shedding.

If you have long lasting muscle twitches that are impacting your quality of life and are not stopping, contact your doctor and get a check up. While rare, there are some serious illnesses that can cause muscle twitching, and you will want to rule them out as the cause of your twitching.

Find A School In Your Area. Granted, some places will have more Irish dancing schools than others. Places in the British Isles (obviously enough) and the Boston area will have more schools just because these is a lot of Irish people and immigrants in those places. Not that you can't find a place in the Midwest, it just won't likely be as easy. Try typing in Irish dance schools in X area in a search engine. You may be surprised about how many results you get. 2. Do Some Research. Once you find a school whom you think may be a good candidate, do some research. What's the teacher to student ratio, what are their policies, how do they work competition wise?, etc. If the website doesn't give you the information you want, you may want to make a call to their office. 3. Get Your Supplies. The list of supplies you'll end up needing will vary largely depending on whether or not you decide to compete.	Starting out, you'll need a pair of soft shoes. Ghillies, the soft shoe for Irish dancing can't be found at most regular dance stores, so you'll probably need to look online or shop at the vendors that are always traveling around at the local feisanna (plural of feis.) However, ghillies are not absolutely necessary the first or even the second year. You can start off with black jazz or ballet shoes. (Only girls wear ghillies. Boys always wear black jazz shoes, no matter what their level.) You do not need to worry about hard shoes as a beginner, as the purchase of them is on the discretion of the teacher, based on your individual progress and how fast your teacher moves.

Find a vocal coach or qualified voice teacher if you can afford one. It could be someone you know who has gone through voice training already, but it is always good to look for a professional. Incorrectly performed techniques can ruin your singing voice. Investing in an experienced vocal coach is well worth the money. If your voice is weak, know that this is usually caused by under-developed muscles or improper use of the resonators (the pharynx, the hard palate, and the nasal cavity). * If you cannot afford or do not want the dedication that comes with hiring a professional voice coach, consider joining a local choir. There are also a few learn at home vocal training courses out there such as Singing Success, Sing and See, Singorama, Singing for the Stars and Vocal Release, but be sure to do your research to see which ones have really worked for other singers. * Be careful in your choice of teacher -- there are some bad ones out there. If you're in a school with choir, get in there and sing your heart out! If you don't want to have to pay for voice lessons try to google some singing and vocal exercises. 2. Learn your vocal range. This is essential, as singing pieces written for the wrong range may strain your voice. The tone of your voice is much more important than range. People will love or hate your voice based on its sound character, not how many notes you can hit. Never sacrifice tone for range (stay inside your range). Your range can change over time and with maturity and training but vocal chords can not learn to physically change. 3. Correct your posture. Stand tall with one foot slightly in front of the other one, feet shoulder width apart. This allows you to breathe easily and to allow maximum lung capacity to allow better notes and phrases. Stand up straight, shoulders back and down, floating over your torso. Make sure that your chest is high to give room for your lungs to expand and contract. Relax your jaw, relax your face. 4. Breathe properly. The voice is best described as a wind instrument, because breathing is 80% of singing and proper singing begins and ends with proper breathing. 5. Get to know your singing tools so that you are more familiar with how everything is supposed to move and feel. * Touch the top of your collar bone. About a half of an inch below your finger is the top of your lungs. * Find your nipple line. This is the place where your lungs expand the largest. * Find your ribs. Your ribs move like bucket handles attached to your spine and your sternum. When you breath in, they move upward and make your chest expand, when you breathe out, they move downward and your chest decreases. * Find the place right below your sternum where your rib cages meet. This is the bottom of your lungs and the housing of your diaphragm. The reason your stomach may pooch out when you breathe deeply is because your diaphragm is pushing down on everything below your rib cage, not because your lungs are in your stomach. 6. Develop and show your confidence. Do not care what people think, just keep practicing and you will gain confidence. Make sure that you are ready to sing. 7. Always warm up before you begin singing or doing practice exercises. You should always warm your voice up in this pattern: middle range, low range, then high range, then back to middle. You should spend at least 10 minutes on each range and do not stress your voice if you're frustrated and cannot hit a note. Warm back down or up to your comfortable range and then try again, carefully. Other things to practice: * Dynamics - Sing a comfortable pitch and start very softly, crescendo to loud then decrescendo back to soft. Do this with many different vowels and pitches. Dynamics are variations the intensity of your resonance. Even the simplest use of dynamics will make your songs come alive, and the more you practice, the louder and softer you'll be able to sing healthily. When reading music, from quietest to loudest, dynamics marks are as follows: pp (pianissimo, very quiet), p (piano, quiet), mp (mezzo piano, medium quiet), mf (mezzo forte, medium loud), f (forte, loud), ff (fortissimo, very loud). When you start out you will probably only be able to sing from mp to mf, but your range will increase with practice. * Agility - Try singing from do to sol to do really fast back and forth, trying to hit all of the notes. Do this in increments of half steps on different syllables. This will help your voice become more flexible. 8. Pronounce your vowels correctly. Words are truly nothing but a constant succession of vowels with consonants dropped in occasionally to create meaning.	"In English there are very few pure vowels. Normally, we will encounter diphthongs which are two or more vowel sounds elided together. In classical singing, the singer will sustain the note on the first vowel and then say the second on the way to the final consonant. In country, singers like to slide through the first vowel and elongate the second vowel on the sustained note. Where as: a classical signer would sing ""Am[aaaaaaai]zing Gr[aaaaaai]ce"" and a country singer would sing ""Am[aiiiiiii]zing Gr[aiiiiii]ce"". If you can, always sing the first vowel for as long as you can before letting the second vowel in. Here are some pure vowels to practice with: AH as in ""father"", EE as in ""eat"", IH as in ""pin"", EH as in ""pet"", OO as in ""food"", UH as in ""under"", EU as in ""could"", OH as in ""home"". Try singing all above of these vowels while maintaining your core sound which is the resonance in the mask of the face. You can do this in many ways. Some examples of singing exercises that use vowels are just singing ""mee may maw mow moo"" and fluctuating the voice as you go. This warms your voice up and gives you practice with singing vowels."

systems slow down due to registry errors. The following procedures work for most malware (except perhaps for completely new, unknown or unusually malignant strains). It is better to complete all steps, so you can be (reasonably) sure that all traces have been eradicated.
Remove_a_Virus.txt	Begin_Revision	0.959	### Extreme Cases – “Safe Modes” are not accessible	11513	Finally once these viruses are removed via using the boot disc it is recommended to begin from step 7 again to continue further scans .	### Extreme Cases – “Safe Modes” are not accessible	11576	Once these viruses are removed via using the boot disc it is recommended to begin from step 7 again to continue further scans .	<delete><Finally><1>|||<replace><once><2><Once><1>	True	Extreme Cases – “Safe Modes” are not accessible  1. Have a boot disk. In these cases some anti-virus manufactures like Norton, AVG, Kaspersky and GData provide “Boot Discs”. These boot discs can generally be downloaded from their websites with all the latest updates included, so if possible download one of these boot discs and burn it to CD. 2. Reboot with disks. Once you have your Disc you want to reboot your computer/laptop and boot from CD. Many different branded computers/laptops have slightly different ways of booting from disc in most cases Esc, F9, F10 or F11 are used on start-up to access the menu option allowing you to select to boot from your CD/DVD Drive(it is suggested researching on the internet your device and which hotkey to use). 3. Scan by boot disk. When you have booted to disc run the virus scan from the CD.

Close all of your windows properly. This includes making sure storm windows are installed and closed in place if you have them. Windows should be latched. Open them during the day if the outside temperature is higher than the inside. 2. Keep your windows air-tight. You may want to purchase removable window-caulk or plastic to better seal them. At a minimum, stuff a towel or shirt in front of any noticeable leaks. 3. Use cheap clear shower curtains over the windows that receive sun light. This will keep the cold air out, and the warmth from the sun will heat your house without cold air coming in. 4. Seal your doors. Check around the door frame and also under the door. You may want to buy weather stripping or a door sweep. Again, at minimum, make a draft dodger or stuff a towel at the bottom of the door. 5. Close off any un-used rooms. The closed door makes that room another barrier between you and the frigid outdoors. It also stops air from circulating as much, which reduces heat loss.	That way when the heater does click on, only the registers in the rooms you use will pump out heat. Makes for more efficient use of the heater. Check that all heat registers are adjusted open, especially where plumbing pipes might freeze. Unblock cold air returns in heated rooms [they may be blocked with furniture or rug] so heat can circulate efficiently.

If you see the safeties and cornerbacks freeze in coverage, attack the space between them. 3. Check for holes. This is the most important thing to look for. If a receiver is not going to be in a hole, change the route. 4. Look for a blitz. If the linebackers or safeties are cheating toward the line at all, be ready to dump the ball off.	if you see a linebacker that appears like they will blitz, let the linemen know so that they can keep them away from you.

Make your mark. You need to show everyone that you're not to be messed with. However, do not beat people for no reason. If you see a fight going on or you think one is going to happen, split it up. If any of the members try to beat you up for doing so, be ready. 2. If any of the two (or more) start kicking and punching you, let a teacher see it. As soon as you're sure the teacher has seen and knows what's going on, then you must attack the bully(ies). If a teacher doesn't see him/her hit you first, you're going to get the blame. 3. No matter if someone is stronger than you, you can probably still beat them. You need to have confidence in yourself. Guard yourself but don't turn your back to them, as this will make you look weak. Take a punch from someone; don't run away. If the opponent is taller than you, don't worry; height doesn't alter one's strength. 4. If you successfully beat up this person (especially if they are strong) you will have everyone scared as they'll think you are stronger. But don't build popularity around violence; that is not the way to do it. You're supposed to look for an ""opportunity"" to prove yourself. 5. If this works, you can be as nerdy and as clever as you want. Everyone will be scared and will not bully you because of your intelligence. 6. If people still bully you, tell as many teachers as possible and your parents. You might suffer from even more bullying if you tell but it should be worth it. If the teachers stop the bullying, then that's good. If this doesn't work...then try again however, remember, violence isn't the answer. 7. Understand self defense. It is protection from harm. Sometimes it is physical; sometimes it is running or evading a problem in other ways. Its purpose, when it is physical, is nothing more than to stop yourself from being physically hurt. Most children consider keeping the abuse a secret a form of self-defense, and it can be. However, more often it is exactly the kind the bully prefers that you use. Self-defense can sometimes incriminate you (make you seem like a criminal, which may require a judge to decide). You must decide whether or not to report the crime after you use self-defense. 8. Then, with that understanding in mind, report every crime when it is safe for you to do so."	Honesty is a good way to build trust with the authorities. Touching you in any way without your permission is a crime, even if the perpetrator is a child. Report emergencies such as very recent abuse that involve an immediate threat to health, life, or property when there has not yet been any competent adult intervention by calling 9-1-1. Report crimes with no current threat to a teacher, principal, or to police.

The ice may decrease inflammation and pain and help the leg heal. * Use ice for 15 to 20 minutes at a time several times a day. * Wrap the ice pack in a towel to protect your dog’s skin from the cold. * Examine her skin for white or firm patches, which can indicate the pack is too cold. 3. Give her pain medication. Your dog may experience pain or discomfort. Give her a pain reliever to ease pain and inflammation. * Give her an over-the-counter NSAID like ibuprofen or naproxen sodium to reduce inflammation, but only if your dog is otherwise fit and well and is not taking any other medications.	.

Treat_a_Hiatal_Hernia.txt	Begin_Revision	0.92	### Changing Your Lifestyle	1093	Also avoid lying down on your back or side after you eat .	### Changing Your Lifestyle	1161	Avoid lying down on your back or side after you eat .	<delete><Also><1>|||<replace><avoid><2><Avoid><1>	True	Changing Your Lifestyle  1. Stop smoking. Since hiatal hernias cause acid reflux symptoms, the first method of treatment is to prevent reflux, reduce acid production, and increase esophagus clearance. This can be done by reducing risk factors and implementing lifestyle changes. Smoking can cause problem for your hiatal hernia symptoms. Studies have shown that smoking tobacco relaxes this sphincter, a band of muscles around where the esophagus meets the stomach, allowing the stomach to push through it. The sphincter squeezes to prevent stomach contents from coming back up. * Quitting smoking can be challenging. Speak with family, friends, and your doctor if you are seriously considering it. They can motivate and guide you to treatment options such as medications, nicotine patch, nicotine gum, and other healthy choices. 2. Avoid certain foods. Certain types of foods can lead to stomach irritation and increased acid production. Over time, this can affect the sphincter and lead to reflux and hernias. In order to prevent and control your symptoms, avoid or limit foods such as: * Chocolate * Onions and garlic * Spicy foods * Fatty foods such as fried foods * Citrus foods such as oranges * Tomato based foods * Alcohol * Peppermint or spearmint * Carbonated beverages like sodas * Dairy products, such as milk and ice cream * Coffee 3. Eat healthier foods. In addition to avoiding certain foods, there are foods you can eat which will help you prevent further symptoms from your hiatal hernia. Try to include more healthier options for your stomach to handle, such as lean meats like skinless chicken, red meat with little visible fat, ground turkey instead of ground beef, and fish. Lean beef cuts include round, chuck, sirloin, or loin. Lean pork cuts include tenderloin or loin chop. You can also improve your diet by: * Baking or broil foods instead of frying. * Skimming off fat from meat during cooking. * Trying not to use too much spicy seasoning. * Eating low-fat dairy foods, such as low-fat yogurt instead of ice cream. * Steaming your vegetables with water instead of broth. * Limiting butter, oils, and cream sauces. Use cooking spray instead of cooking oil when sautéing. * Choosing low-fat or nonfat ingredients over full-fat products. 4. Consider other dietary concerns. There are other food-related concerns that need to be considered when you are dealing with a hiatal hernia. When purchasing food items, always check the content or ingredient lists. If you are unsure if other food products may be triggering symptoms, take note before eating them and compare to it to how you feel after eating them. Also try eating smaller meals throughout the day rather than large meals. This gives your stomach an easier time to digest and produces less acid than larger meals. * Do not eat too quickly either as this may give a similar effect. 5. Reduce pressure in your stomach. Increased abdominal pressure can put more pressure on the sphincter, leading to acid reflux or hernias. To reduce pressure on your stomach, try not to strain when passing stool. If you do strain or feel more constipated, add more fiber based foods to your diet such as fruits and grains. Try not to lift heavy objects because this puts pressure on your stomach and can aggravate symptoms or cause a hernia. *	Your stomach is full and laying down puts more pressure in the area.

Teach students how to take notes and remember important details. If your students are allowed to make marks in their books, teach them to circle the names of important characters, put checkmarks beside important plot points, or even highlight or underline areas they think are important. Or, you could also encourage your students to take notes on a piece of paper. * Especially if students have trouble remembering details, marking them in the text or writing them down can help imprint that information in their minds. *	.

Paint a mental picture of what you want. You are always less likely to hurt someone’s feelings if you can communicate how you feel and what you need without making them defensive. Try to describe in detail how you feel, and help them picture what you need. * For example, you could say, “I have had such a hard work week. In an ideal world, I would be able to lie in my bed all day. Can I ask you a favor? Would you mind if we didn’t hang out tonight?” 2. Follow a script. If you want to politely decline social invitations, but you are feeling shy, just follow a script. This will help you not to overly-apologize. It is perfectly okay to say “no” without saying “I’m sorry.” Here are a few samples: * When you just want to say no: “My week has been really busy. I think I need to take it easy tonight. Thanks though!” * When you don’t want to hang out with a whole group: “Thanks for thinking of me, but I have to pass. Would you want to make some plans just for the two of us? I need a breather from group situations. * When you aren’t up for it tonight, but still want to meet up another time: “This sounds like so much fun! Would it be possible to get a rain check?” 3. Offer an alternative. Anytime you ask a friend for space, you run the risk of making them feel unwanted. You can minimize these feelings by offering an alternative. * If you are not up for going someplace really public, maybe you would be okay with just handing out together at home? * If you really just need to be alone right now, maybe you could make plans for next week? * If you need space for quite a while, maybe you would be okay with just texting once or twice a week? 4. Consider their needs. All relationships involve give and take. As you assert your need for space, think about your friend’s needs too. If they need reassurance or attention to feel happy, perhaps you could agree to check in with them.	There is almost always some way for you to both have your needs satisfied.

If your regular veterinarian is not available, for instance the problem is occurring on a day the veterinary office is closed, then you should call an emergency veterinary office in your area. * Your veterinary office may ask you some questions about your rabbits condition and they should help you assess whether it needs to be seen. 2. Keep the rabbit cool while in transport. If you need to transport the rabbit to a vet, keep cooling it as you go. Wrap the rabbit in a damp towel and have the air conditioning on in the car. * Transporting a rabbit with heat stroke while continuing to try to cool it down may require two people. However, if you don't have anyone to help just keep the temperature in the car cool and give the rabbit access to cool water. 3. Avoid stressing the rabbit out further.	Some rabbit's can really sense stress and react physically to being stressed themselves. They have sensitive systems, so whatever you can do to keep them calm will help.

Some phones may require that the ringtone be located in a specific folder and/or copied from the memory card to internal memory.

Understand that your baby, thinking simply, associates various object, people, and activities with going to sleep. These are called ""sleep associations"". * If a sleep association involves you, then your baby will think they need you to fall asleep. * If a sleep association involves feeding or rocking, agian, you baby will think they need food and/or rocking to fall asleep. * Other sleep associations include pacifiers, bottles, and teddy bears. Sleep associations are not inherently a bad thing -- since it is natural for a baby -- but as the parent, you need to choose the best association for your child to have a complete and restful nights sleep. 2. Establish a sleep association from day one. After bringing your newborn home from the hospital, settle them into their room and try various associations that make you baby calm and comfortable. * Various products exist to help parents understand what to do. Talking softly to your baby is the most widely-accepted method. Books such as ""The Secrets of The Baby Whisperer,"" teach parents how to talk to their babies. * This will help you establish good sleep habits early on, before any habits form. 3. Ensure your baby is in a good routine, preferably with set times for during-the-day naps and nightly bedtime. This helps your baby understand what you expect and when you expect it, and this helps your settling training work much faster. 4. Decide on a personal level that you are going to stop rocking, feeding, driving or whatever else you are doing to get your baby to sleep. 5. Choose which method to use to have your baby settle themselves to sleep: * Cry-it-Out Method: Many people will advise you to just leave your baby to cry and they will eventually fall asleep. This is the best-known way to get babies to fall asleep by themselves. * No Cry Method: Suitable for babies aged newborn to 2 years, this techniqueCovers techniques for weaning off feeding to sleep, needing a dummy to fall asleep and rocking or needing a parent to fall asleep. 6. Sleeping Like a Baby - suitable from newborn to toddlers, this book covers a simple plan to gradually teach baby to fall asleep without needing a parent present. It is especially suitable if you have been co-sleeping or have a strong attachment parenting philosophy. 7. No Cry Sleep Solution for Toddlers & Preschoolers - appropriate for children 1 - 6 years. Gradual behaviour change to teach children to settle at bedtime, solve settling for naps, dealing with settling issues during the night when children visit parents bed, weaning off feeding to sleep and more. Highly recommended for toddler settling issues. 8. Limited or controlled crying techniques: 9. With these techniques, you teach your baby to fall asleep independently by giving them the opportunity to do so. Many babies need a period of winding down to fall asleep, and by not letting them cry at all, they can miss the opportunity to learn to fall asleep. 10. These techniques can work quickly with a lot of babies, however consistency is very important to making them work effectively."	To use one of these programs, you need to be sure you can listen to your baby crying for a period of time and be consistent with how you respond.

Recognize that keeping the name you were born with goes against many years of tradition in certain countries. This doesn't mean that you should change your mind. It is still your decision. 2. But remember too, that traditions are not set in stone. In some countries like Italy,it is traditional for women to keep their family name,and even when a woman decides to use her husband's surname she can't relinquish her own and will continue to use it in official documents,id cards,passports etc. for the rest of her life. 3. Still, you need to understand the basic points-of-view before you proceed. Be open and confident about your decision to keep your name. You are certainly not alone in your decision. Women choose to keep their birth names for a variety of reasons.	(E.g. - When providing references for work done in the past, a woman who has changed her name would have to ask a potential employer to use her birth name when calling her references, as her old employers or professors will not recognize her by her new last name. This creates an inconvenience that for some women, does not outweigh the benefits of changing their name.) One's name is part of one's identity, and many women choose to keep their identities independent from their marital status. The traditional concept of marriage includes a more linked identity to one's spouse. Your name is your own, part of your identity and heritage, and you have every right to keep it if you wish. A clear and firm understanding of your beliefs will help you to be confident and, if necessary, defend your choice as you announce your decision to others.

Understand the purpose of a sonnet. A sonnet is a poem that expresses a single, complete thought, idea, or sentiment. A sonnet must consist of 14 lines, usually in iambic pentameter (see below), with the rhymes arranged according to one of certain definite schemes. 2. Learn the basic definitions. Before tackling the sonnet, you'll need to understand the meaning of some of the elements of a sonnet. They are: * Iambic: An ""iamb"" is a variety of the rhythmic unit called a foot. It has a single unstressed syllable and a single stressed syllable. * Pentameter: This refers to the need to repeat the iamb five times. * Quatrains: Four lines of a stanza or poem. * Rhyming couplet: This is two lines together that must rhyme. 3. Choose your style of sonnet. The two most common kind of sonnets are the Petrarchan (Italian) sonnet and the Shakespearean (English) sonnet. In a sonnet, there are set placements for the quatrains within the total of 14 lines. The sonnet must follow a standard rhyme scheme: * The Petrarchan sonnet consists of two quatrains (eight lines or the octave) and a closing minor group of six lines (the sestet). The pattern is: ABBA ABBA CDE CDE. The letters represent a rhyme, meaning that a's should rhyme with a's and b's should rhyme with b's. * The Shakespearean style is three quatrains followed by a couplet: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. In The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets, Helen Vendler describes it as Q1, Q2, Q3, and C. The couplet at the end is usually a very strong rhyme to end it off. This is called a heroic couplet, rhyming couplet or a couplet in iambic pentameter. * The quatrains often represent three different stages in the development of an idea (or argument), while the couplet sums up the essential premise of the poem. 4. Understand the rhyme patterns. In order to write the sonnet, you'll need a good grasp of how to rhyme according to the standard rhyme scheme you've chosen. Each letter (A or B, for example) stands for the ending sound of the line. So, the ABAB code means that the first line and the third line rhyme (A with A) and the second line rhymes with the fourth line (B with B). CCCC would be a code for four lines which all rhyme with each other. Let's use Sonnet 18 as an example, Shall I Compare Thee To a Summer's Day:left|Sonnet Structure 5. Use iambic pentameter. Getting used to this style of writing takes practice, so don't feel bad if you have a hard time at first. It is where every other syllable is stressed, so that each line ends with a strong rhythm. There are also ten syllables in each line, five of which have emphasis (pentameter). The ninth line of the sonnet (Shakespearean/Italian style) usually has a turn or a change of tone. This image might help – as you read, the stressed syllables are underlined in blue. center|description 6. Create the argument. Not only do you need to get the crafting of the rhyme and rhythm right but there is also a requirement that your sonnet ""builds up"" and presents a type of argument that is resolved by the end. To use the example of a Shakesperean sonnet, here is what is involved: * Quatrain 1: Express the main theme and the main metaphor. * Quatrain 2: Expand both; be imaginative, provide an example perhaps. * Quatrain 3: Add a twist or a conflict (peripeteia) which will often begin with ""but"", often from the ninth line. * Couplet: Resolve the theme and leave the reader with a new way of looking at things, or a ""discovery"". 7. Use methods to help you. When writing a sonnet, there are some techniques you can use to help your planning and writing: * On a piece of paper draw a straight line. Divide it into five even portions. Each of those portions can then be filled with one stressed, one unstressed syllable until you reach the end of the line. You should find this gives you 10 syllables in iambic pentameter. * Continue this process all the way down the sonnet (it will work for both Italian and Shakespearean styles). * Whenever you're trying to use a word or concept that upsets the syllables, use a thesaurus to find a word that will work better. 8. Keep writing and stay flexible in your attempts. It will probably take you a few drafts to be happy with your sonnet, but don't get discouraged. This style of writing is tight, precise, and very expressive with few words; and with practice, this tends to be a lot of fun for the poet. Keep the thesaurus by your side and you'll be fine. And you don't need to feel that it is necessary to stay within the strict patterns of Shakespearean and Petrarchan sonnet styles; poetry is a fluid art form, so feel free to alter the rhyme scheme or shape of a sonnet to suit your vision. For example, ""Sonnet 145"" was in tetrameter."	.

Burn safe materials. Only burn natural materials in your fireplace; never introduce foreign substances, including cardboard, newspaper, or paper trash. These substances burn poorly, produce a lot of smoke, and release chemicals into the air. Only burn tinder (such as pine needles or tiny sticks), kindling (small sticks or pinecones), and fuel (large logs, up to about 14” long). * Burning hardwood (such as maple and oak) will diminish the amount of soot and ash buildup in your chimney. Also avoid burning wood that is wet or still green, as it will produce large amounts of smoke and not burn well. 2. Avoid using flammable liquids to start fires. You should never put gasoline into a fireplace. Gas is volatile, and could easily cause a fire to get out of control. If you’re struggling to light a fire, use a small amount of lighter fluid instead, although it’s best to just use matches and tinder. Flammable liquids are risky and raise the chances of a house fire. * If your fires aren’t starting consistently, hardware stores also sell small (rough 2” x 2”) fire-starter squares that will burn for about 15–20 minutes. 3. Start the fire correctly. If you build your fire efficiently the first time, it will burn for longer, heat your home effectively, and result in minimal smoke escaping into your home.	Lay the wood pieces in such a way that there will be room for airflow under the fire—without airflow, the fire will go out immediately. Finally, add two or three logs on top; you can add more logs once the initial couple are burning.

Identify a specific goal you’d like to nurture and/or track. Before you decide to track anything, consider if it’s worth your time, effort and desire. Of course nearly anything in life can be tracked--even moods or thoughts, however select something that will truly enhance and improve your life. * Consider a project/goal that is important but you haven’t seemed to make headway or progress in that area. Have you been trying to lose weight since New Year’s Eve or have you tried every remedy to rid your body of a newly acquired allergy? Find something that you’d like to improve, change or remove from your life and make that your focal point. * Determine how tracking this goal will have an impact on your life. What would happen if you lost weight or finally cleaned out the garage? Whatever your goal, imagine what your life would be like once you’ve reached it in order to provide you with additional motivation. * Decide what you ultimately want to result from tracking this goal. Although you have a goal such as “lose 20 pounds” or “improve endurance while running” what is the ultimate result? Is it being able to ask out a guy you’ve had your eye on for years, but have been too shy because of your weight? Or is your goal being able to regain a healthy lifestyle so you can play with your kids or have the endurance to keep up with the rest of your family? 2. Examine both the main goal and surrounding entities. Before you can determine how you will track this goal you need to break down your goal’s features and surrounding variable. * What are the components of your main goal? Although the main goal could be the same for many people, factors that influence how you will achieve that goal may differ. For example if you want to lose weight, what are the components that are necessary for losing weight--for you in particular? For some exercise might be important and the way they like to reduce weight, whereas for others the main focus will be calorie reduction. Each main goal has a unique set of circumstances surrounding it. Find the most important before you begin tracking. * What surrounding variables will factor into your tracking? For example, if you want to improve lung function, which other aspects should be examined? With the student from Berlin, he not only measured his breathing, but also identified which relaxation exercises were most effective. Another example taken from “The Economist” is a London investment banker who had trouble sleeping. The banker not only tracked his sleep patterns he also measured diet, health supplements, exercise and alcohol consumption. As a result of including all the information, the banker found that when he consumed too much alcohol, it interfered with the quality of his sleep. Additionally, he found that taking magnesium supplements enhanced his quality and deepness of sleep. 3. Explore a tracking system that works well for your goal and lifestyle. Although there are numerous ways to track your progress every tracker is not designed for every type of project and lifestyle. Take numerous factors into consideration such as how you spend your day (at the office or outside) and what kind of access you have to your tracker. * Online trackers or mobile apps. A slew of online tracking sites ranging from DigiFit for the exercise enthusiast to MoodScope, a web based application that measures and tracks your mood can help you stay the course. Keep in mind that several of these online trackers also have a social/interactive component that allows you to connect with other users and share/comment on data and progress. Online trackers or mobile apps can be used in a variety of circumstances and for a myriad of occasions. * Pen and paper. Not the most sophisticated method but ideal for those who prefer to see their progress in writing, pen and paper tracking has been done throughout the years. Trackers can use a daily planner to write statistics and/or observations throughout the day and then reflect or total the final daily number each evening. Tracking goals through writing may be attractive for people who may not be as comfortable using an online tracker or for those who do not have access to a mobile device. * Graphs and charts. Tracking progress using charts or graphs can be done manually or with software. Spreadsheets like Excel allow the user to input data and have it automatically calculated based on set parameters. This method may be ideal for someone tracking facts and figures in an office or home office environment. 4. Commit to track your goal for a certain amount of time. Tracking your progress for a few days and then giving up won’t help you achieve your goal or produce results. Before you commit to tracking, estimate how long it could possibly take to see results. For example, if you want to lose 20 pounds and losing two pounds per week is considered to be an average amount, determine how long it should take you to lose all the weight. * Test drive your tracking method for a defined number of days, weeks or months to determine if it is the right fit. You may not be completely sold on your method of tracking, especially if this is your first time using the app or method. Commit to try the tracker for at least a week to discover additional functionality or components.	.

Remember the more faster the sensitivity, the harder it is to be more accurate. I would recommend a 7-7 sensitivity on Console and 400 DPI on a Mouse. These allow you to turn quickly, whilst not significantly making it harder to aim. 3. Landing smart * When landing, you should make sure you pick a location that isn't heavily populated. Nuketown Island, Firing Range & Asylum might seem appealing, but these are all popular locations which means a lot of other players will be dropping there. Making your chances of survival a lot less. I would recommend landing somewhere on the map that isn't 'Named'. Pick somewhere on the outskirts or wait until the end of the Helicopter's flight path before you land. This will ensure you encounter less enemies and will get you to end game more often. 4. Be observant * When making your way around the map. There is certain things you should look out for. If you see a vehicle parked nearby, it means there could be other players around. If you see broken windows or open doors, that means the area is already looted and people could be close by. You should also keep a lookout for bags on the ground, this means players have been killed near here and you should be extra careful. 5. Know which weapons suit you * Which weapons you pick up heavily depends on your play style. * Do you like to run and gun? A Submachine Gun and Shotgun would be recommended. * Do you prefer to take your enemies at range? Assault Rifles, Tactical Rifles, Light Machine Guns and Sniper Rifles are recommended. *	Some are not worth picking up unless you have no other options at the time.

Lenses like 50mm f/1.8 on a cropped sensor camera are popular, cheap, sharp, and great for portraits. Normal lenses (50mm equivalent on a 35mm film camera) are useful in a wide range of situations. On the cheaper Nikon and Canon DSLRs, a normal lens has a focal length of about 35mm. Primes tend to be sharper, cheaper, and faster (you can use a faster shutter speed). But don't buy another lens to make your pictures sharper unless you've played with all the things mentioned. * If you feel like looking closer at your photos to figure out if they're not sharp, you can find some open-source software to do it here.	.

For example, saying that you love James Bond movies may be specific, but adding which Bond movie one is your favorite and why is more specific. This also helps give your prospect something to say when responding. Being specific is also a good way to avoid clichés. * Be positive. The saying that ""misery loves company"" does not apply here. Be positive about yourself and others. Avoid saying things like ""no losers please"". * Be honest. If you lie, it will catch up with you somewhere down the road. You want someone who will accept you for who you are, not who you wish you were. * Be modest."	"If you're really good at something and think it might help your personal ad, try to present it in a neutral way. For instance, if you are good at playing the piano, you can say something like ""my friends say I'm really good at the piano and love to hear me play""."

Think of a short, visual story to translate from your head to the page. Comic books are a blast because they merge written words with cinematic images, blending the best of both novels and movies. Remember this when considering stories -- you want something with big, fun images and visuals as well as a fair amount of conversation and dialogue. While there are no wrong ideas, some things to keep in mind include:center * Keeping stories visual: A long passage where a character is musing or thinking may be hard to express in comics, though not impossible. Similarly, a conversation story in only one room is likely better suited for a short story, since you don't have many pages of new visuals. * Streamlining the story: More characters, locations, and action is great, but it significantly increases the workload on the illustrator. The best comic books tell their stories quickly and efficiently, using both dialogue and visual cues to keep things moving. * An Artistic Style: Truly great comic books have art that fits seamlessly with the tone of the writing, like the dirty, water colored V for Vendetta, compared to Marvel Civil War's bright, cartoonish, and action-packed comics. If you're an artist, this may be easy. But even writers should think about the type of story and artwork they love. What kind of mood does it strike, and how can your story do the same? 2. Draft out the plot of your story in paragraph form. Just start writing, not worrying about form, content, or how it will look on the page. Once you have your idea down, get the pen flowing. Put the characters or idea in motion and see what happens. If you throw 90% of this away, that is okay. Remember the advice of writer and animator Dan Harmon, who claimed that the first draft is 98% terrible, but the next one is only 96% bad, and so on until you have a great story. Find the 2% that's awesome and build off it:center * What characters are the most fun to write? * What plot points did you find yourself most interested in exploring? * Are there things that you thought were good ideas that you just can't write? Consider ditching them. * Talk this draft over with some friends to get advice on what they love and how to go forward. 3. Create round, flawed, and exciting characters. Characters drive plots in almost all great movies, comics, and books. Almost all comics are the result of a character who wants something but is unable to get it -- from villains trying to rule the world (and heroes trying to save it) to a young girl looking to figure out her complex political environment (Persepolis). The fun of any comic book, whether about super heroes or average Joes, is following a character's trials, tribulations, and personal flaws as they try to accomplish their goals. A great character:center * Is round. Has both strength and weaknesses, just like anyone else. This makes them relatable. We don't like Superman just because he saves they day, but because his awkward alter-ego Clark Kent reminds us of our own awkward, nervous days. * Has both desires and fears. Great characters want something they can't have, and this conflict makes your story. It is no mistake that Bruce Wayne, the Batman, is deathly scared of bats -- just like he is scared of failing his city and parents. This makes him far more relatable than a weirdo in a cape. * Has agency. Whenever a character makes a choice, make sure it is the character deciding to do it -- not the author forcing the character to do it because ""the plot needs it."" This is the quickest way to lose your audience. 4. Introduce a problem, fail to solve it, and then resolve the problem with a surprise to create instant plot. If this sounds too simple, it is. But it is the genesis of all plot. You have your characters, and they have a problem (The Joker is on the loose, the Avengers broke up, Scott Pilgrim got dumped). They decide to fix the problem, and fail (The Joker escapes, Captain America and Iron Man start fighting, Scott Pilgrim has to fight 7 exes). In a triumphant final push, your characters finally prevail (Batman defeats The Joker, Cap and Ironman usher in peace, Scott Pilgrim gets the girl). These are your major plot points and you can play with them however you want. But knowing these three stepping stones ahead of time will save you a lot of writing headaches.center * ""First act—Get your hero up a tree; second act—throw rocks at him; third act—get him down."" -- Anonymous * Make life hell for your characters -- it makes the payoff more rewarding. * You can always play with this structure, and you should -- don't forget that (spoiler alert) Captain America gets assassinated shortly after peace is brokered in Civil War."	.

Introduce your story. In the beginning of your story, take care to fully describe your setting and characters who are present in the beginning of your story. Just make sure that you don’t give away too much information in the beginning. Leave some things to describe later, like the villain and other mysterious elements of your story. You can hint at these things early in your story, but don’t give in to the urge to share too much too soon. 2. Maintain an air of gloom and horror throughout your story. You can make sure that your story has a high level of creepiness by incorporating plenty of unnerving details. Taking care to describe the moon, the howling wind, or a dark corridor can help you to maintain an air of gloom and horror throughout your story. You can also describe the way that your characters are feeling or acting, as well as their facial expressions. 3. Maintain suspense and mystery throughout your story. Tantalize your readers by only offering them quick glimpses of your villain or a ghost, or by hinting at the family curse by holding off on fully explaining these things until later in the story. 4. Incorporate descriptions of heightened emotions throughout your story. Describing your characters emotional extremes can also contribute to the success of your gothic fiction. Incorporate over-the-top emotions like shrieking, cackling, fainting, and sobbing. These moments of hysteria will pull your readers into the story and help keep them entertained. 5. Incorporate themes of madness. Filtering descriptions of spooky occurrences through the mouth of a character who has gone mad will intrigue your readers and lead them to question what is actually happening.	Roderick’s descent into madness in Edgar Allen Poe’s “Fall of The House of Usher” provides an excellent example of how madness can intensify your story.

Or is it to remind a customer about an unpaid bill or outstanding balance? With this purpose in mind, craft a first line that lets the reader know right away what the letter will be about. Don’t be vague about the purpose of the letter. Cut to the chase. * Start by using “I” if you are stating your opinion as a business owner. Use “we” if you are writing on behalf of a company or organization. * Focus on a direct statement such as: “We are writing to inform you” or “We are writing to request”. You can also use an “I” statement if you are writing as the owner of the business. Such as: “I am contacting you because” or “I recently heard about...and would like to know more about…” * For example, you (the business owner) are writing Nina Brown about an unpaid bill from last month. Begin the letter with: “I am contacting you because you have an outstanding balance on your account from March 2015.” * Or, you are an employee at a company and are writing in response to a customer complaint against the company’s space program. Begin the letter with: “We received your complaint about our Mars space program.” * You may be writing to inform the reader they won a contest, or they received a spot in a graduate program. Begin with a phrase like: “I am delighted to inform you…” Or “We are excited to inform you…”. If you’re delivering bad news, begin with a phrase like: “We regret to inform you…”. Or, “After careful consideration, I have decided not to…”. 3. Use the active, rather than the passive, voice. We use the passive voice all the time in common speech. But the passive voice can make your writing seem dull or confusing. The active voice is much more effective in a business letter because it establishes a more assertive tone. * An example of the passive voice might be: “What specific complaints can I address for you?” The subject of the sentence, the customer, appears at the end of the sentence, rather than at the beginning of the sentence. * An example of the active voice might be: “What can I do to address your complaints?” This version of the phrase, in the active voice, is much clearer and easier to understand for the reader. * The use of the passive voice can be a good way to get your message across without calling attention to an error or an unflattering point. But use it only in this instance. The active voice is much more effective in business letters. 4. Refer to a previous event or a previous communication with the reader, if applicable. Maybe you contacted Nina Brown earlier last month with a warning about her unpaid bill. Or perhaps a customer expressed their frustration with the space program last month at a conference. If you have already been in touch with the reader, acknowledge this. It will remind the reader of your previous contact and make the business letter feel more immediate and important. * Use a phrase like: “Per my previous letter about your unpaid bill…” or “Thank you for your payment in March.""

Notify your professors. Even though it can be an uncomfortable topic, it is important your instructors know. If they don't know about your struggles, they can't give you the support you need. One of the challenges for providing care for students is that the teachers or university are often not aware of the students' struggles. Once you notify your teachers, they may be able to help by giving you more time on assignments or extra help along the way. * Set up an appointment with your professor to talk about it. * Start the conversation by stating why you are there. “I know I have been struggling in your class and I wanted to talk about it with you.” * Explain as much as you are comfortable with about your depression and what you are struggling with specifically (assignments, physically getting to class, focusing while you are there, etc.). * Your teacher may ask how they can help, so have an idea of what might help you be more successful in the class. 2. Get accommodations. Schools are legally required to provide accommodations to students struggling with physical or mental conditions that impact their ability to learn due to the Americans With Disabilities Act. Depression, anxiety, and other mental health concerns qualify a student for academic accommodations. Getting accommodations in place helps you protect your academic career while you are working on your depression. * Visit your university's Student Services or Disability Services department to ask about the accommodations process. * There is usually some paperwork involved, so if your energy level is not up to it, enlist a family member or friend to help. * If you are concerned about your professors knowing about your depression, look into the confidentiality rules within your school about accommodations. It is possible that due to confidentiality, the department may not be allowed to disclose what the accommodations are for, only that you qualify for them. 3. Visit your school's Psychological or Counseling Services. Make sure to take the time and make an appointment to talk to someone. Counseling or therapy can help you manage your depression, but is also uniquely qualified to help students who are struggling with mental health concerns while in school. They will be able to talk with you to help navigate the process as well as work with you in overcoming embarrassment or emotional hangups to telling staff and professors. In addition to individual therapy, college counseling centers can also provide: * Group Therapy programs for students struggling with depression. * Peer counseling with other students who understand what you are going through. * Additional coping skills to use to help manage your depressive symptoms. * Advocacy help with the school especially during the accommodations process. 4. Identify a classmate who can help. As you are working with your professors and your school, it may also help to have a classmate in each of your classes that you can call on. Identify someone that you are friends with or comfortable with in class. This will be the person who will be able to provide you with class notes or materials if you need them. If you are having difficulty getting up and getting to class, and miss one, your classmate can collect any materials that were handed out for you.	This way, you'll also have someone in each class that empathizes with you and what you are battling.

Keep in mind mumps is contagious before symptoms occur. The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after the person is infected. * Be aware, in addition, that in about 1 in 3 cases, mumps doesn’t cause any noticeable symptoms in the infected person. 2. Check for neck swelling. The most common symptom of mumps is swollen parotid glands, also known as “hamster face”. The parotid glands are a pair of glands that are responsible for producing saliva. They are located on either side of your face, just below your ears. * While both glands are usually affected by the swelling, only one gland can be affected. * Due to the swelling, you may have pain or tenderness around your neck. You may also have dry mouth and a hard time swallowing. 3. Note any other general symptoms of mumps. There are several other symptoms you may experience if you have mumps, including: * Headache * Joint pain and aches * Nausea and a general feeling of illness * Ear pain when chewing * Mild abdominal pain * Loss of appetite * A high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F), or above 4. Check for swollen testicles or breasts. If you are a male over 13, you may develop swollen testicles. If you are a female over 13, you may develop swollen breasts. * Women who contract mumps can also develop swollen ovaries. * For both men and women, the swelling can be painful. However, it will rarely lead to sterility, or the inability to have children. 5. Get a diagnosis from your doctor. Swollen neck glands and the above symptoms are usually a clear sign you have the mumps.	Your doctor may also take a blood or urine sample to run tests and confirm the mumps diagnosis.

Get lots of Toilet paper. It is very very smart to buy your stash BEFORE dusk, as you will look very suspicious buying toilet paper at 10:00 at night. The BEST kind of toilet paper to get is DOUBLE ROLLS. It lasts so much longer, you can usually get 4 or 5 throws over a moderately sized tree, while a single cheap roll of toilet paper will only get 1 or 2 throws over a tree. 2. Pick a time. The time should be one where people are not still up and walking their dogs. Be sure to get information on how late the neighborhood usually stays up. This can be very useful, and sometimes not knowing how late to go can be very embarrassing when you show up somewhere with a bunch of bags. One time we decided to go at 11:30 to toilet paper someone, but lots of lights were on, garages were open, and people WERE actually walking their dogs that late. I would suggest 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock as a good time to go. Don't go too late though! If you wait to long, you will get sleepy, and possible fall asleep, which will ruin the night. 3. The DAY should be considered on what time of year it is. If it is during summer, week days are a must, as most adults will go to bed pretty early. During the rest of the year, it is good to pick a night that you have the following day off. (like, the day before Spring Break, or days in presidents weekend are very good days to hit)Remember that during Summer you will have to stay up EXTRA late, because LOTS of people wait until it is very late to go to bed. A lot of choosing where and when depends on where you live, so make smart decisions! 4. Now for the toilet papering! When you arrive at the house don't freak out if you make noise. If someone sneezes, or you trip over a stick, DON'T WORRY. No one is going to get up in the middle of the night for a minor noise. They WILL, however, wake up and look out the window if the noise persists. So stop the noise ASAP, but don't run away for something small. 5. When you go for trees, pull a long arm's width of toilet paper from the roll.	Throw the roll into the tree. it should trail up and over beautifully, and plunk on the ground on the other side. Walk to the other side, and repeat as necessary. For bushes, trail the toilet paper all over them, and push wads of toilet paper deep into bushes, to make it toilet papered inside, and out.

Are any lights on? Are the windows open? Keep in mind you can still TP them without being caught, you should just be extra careful. * Take pictures at the end to admire at home, then leave because the flash might wake up the owners. If anything is questionable, do it at the end! Just a warning, DO NOT put these pictures online, someone could turn them in and you could get caught. * Be careful with houses that contain bay windows especially if you would be easily seen through them * Travel in two or more groups so you won't end up by yourself. * Be quiet. It's so annoying when you go TPing and people are cracking up or having loud whisper conversations. Being loud will wake up neighbors or the owners of the house, and you could get caught. * ALWAYS do it with friends and be creative(shaving cream,forks,shredded paper.)Another thing is to write a message in the yard with something.You can use cheap shampoo and water. One last thing: Be cheap, have fun, and be smart about it! * Wear navy blue clothing and shoes. You can also wear dark greens, brown, and greys ( to an extent because it may seem suspicious). You may look like a fool, but navy blue (not black- if you wear black and you are caught by the police going to/from, you will look extremely suspicious, and if any passing cars/neighbors see you, you are dead) is great night camouflage. * MAKE SURE that the neighborhood/house you are going to hit does not have 24 hour security cameras. If they don't figure out what time they go off and hit then. If they do try to be super stealth by hiding behind bushes, trees, etc., and also by keeping your face covered with a ski mask for example. Or you could just try a different house/neighborhood. * Take a spray bottle of water and mist surfaces like cars, the paper will stick to it well. * With one person on each side of the car roll under and the other tosses over until the entire car is covered. * Wear running shoes. If you need to run on pavement you are not going to be able to out run a person with something protecting their foot. You should train yourself prior to go time to run quietly on all surfaces. Stealth is a must when escaping someone in the dark. * Layer clothes with lighter colors underneath. This way if you are running you can take off your dark top layer and throw it somewhere. Then you will be seen wearing a new light color therefore people won't think it was you who they saw. only do this if you can sneak out of their sight for a moment. If questioned say you saw a person with a dark shirt run into the woods or into a yard. Girls if you wear your hair up take it down quickly when you do your costume change. * Walk to the house. If you drive, and then you get caught, they may not recognize you, but they may recognize your car! If you must take your car, park it a few houses away. You also may want to cover your license plate so if they try to read your plate, they won't be able to. Just be sure to take off the cover soon. Technically it's illegal. Take it off the second you are out of sight. * Consider focusing on familiar houses, rather than strangers' homes. That way, they will think it is a joke, while others may think it is a crime. * Park your car away from the house, some houses have cameras, and you don't want them to find out which car is yours. * If you fork someones yard check to see if its going to frost in the morning, if so the forks will break when the owner tries to pull them up. * WRAP the fence,weave it,cover it! * Don't egg houses or cars or put peanut butter on the victim's garage doors; this results in stains and it peels the paint off of cars. * If you want, roll the TP around a car and get it wet to make a ""shell"". * Again, be quick, but don't leave without admiring your work. Make sure not to get caught with your guard down while you're doing this. * Throw the paper as high as you can,it makes it look a lot better,and the owner wont be able to get all of it down. * NEVER forget your supplies if someone runs out at you, always grab it so you have a second [third or forth] shot later. Assign someone fast this job. * Buy some normal tissue you blow your nose with, and spread it all over the lawn. Also, the little squares make it easy to make letters to write things. *"	.

Gather your ideas. The following steps can be taken in any order. Starting a task with the most tricky aspect, could discourage and demotivate you before you even start. You'll notice that your non-degree related issues are focused on first and then those which are specific to your degree. People are able to talk more freely about themselves, however ask the all important question ""Why are you choosing this degree"" and they could be lost for words. Remember everything in this section is rough workings, so unless you think of a fancy sentence, stick to brief notes. 1. What you write in your personal statement may make or break your application so start with finding a blank piece of paper and jotting down a whole list of activities and achievements you could tell your potential university. This are anything that's personal to you. Are you involved in a team sport? Were you selected as the most improved modern languages student during your GCSE studies? Everything and anything that makes you stand out from the crowd is worth writing in this preparation stage. 2. Once you've got the bits that make your statement personal, go back to the degree you're considering studying. What is it that drew you to choosing this particular degree? Have you had any work experience related to this future study? Have you previous studied the subject at a lower level? It's these key aspects that will make your personal statement stand out, as everyone will have their own reasons for choosing a particular degree. These bits are still personal and you'll start to see how your personal statement breaks away from the mundane standard statement. * You should now have a list which details the following (use it as a check list): * Why you are applying for this certain degree, your reasons with backed-up ideas and experiences (e.g. reading around the subject) * Future career plans or ideas * Work experience * Previous studies; lessons, topics, fieldwork and projects * Prizes (e.g. Key Stage 3 Science prize) * Extra curricular activities * Hobbies and interests * Part-time job 3. Deciding on a structure: Everyone has their own writing style, and what you write in your personal statement will some what dictate the way your structure develops. 1. Try to plan around a three-paragraph structure. Using all the ideas you previous gathered, split them into the following categories: * One - The degree (Everything that relates to why you are choosing this particular degree and what you have done to confirm your choice, this may even include a childhood experience that relates to your subject - don't be afraid to think outside the box.) * Two - Work experience, career plans and prizes (Pretty self explanatory) * Three - Extra curricular activities, your hobbies, interests and part-time job (As above) 4. Drafting your personal statement: There is no easy way to explain this process, and this is where you're on your own. 1. Using all the ideas you have gathered and categorised, try to explain concisely each of the different aspects, highlighting if they relate to your degree choice, and the personal qualities you have gained from them, whether this be team building, or an improvement in your oral communication, think carefully about these qualities as they will sell your personal statement. 5. Adding an introduction and conclusion: With the main body of your personal statement drafted out, you need to start bringing it all together, tying it up with a snappy conclusion, without forgetting a quirky but interesting introduction. * These two parts need to be kept to a minimum as you will inevitably write more than your character limit. 1. If you're applying for a combined degree, your introduction should state what you are applying to do, and why you have chosen to study the two subjects together. 2. The final conclusion should be a brief summary of your reasoning behind choosing the degree, it's your one final chance to clinch the deal, and assure them you've put great time and effort into this decision. 6. Condensing your personal statement to fit within the requirements: If your personal statement is already within the requirements, then skip to the next step. 1. You've probably written quite a bit, and this is the time you've got to be ruthless. Start working through your personal statement deciding if what has been written is relevant to your degree, or shows you to be special in any way. 2. When you've deleted all the irrelevant content, it's time to start rewording. You'll be amazed at how much you can reduce your personal statement by cutting out a lot of 'woffly' language. The key to a successful personal statement is to be concise, the admissions tutor definitely doesn't want to read anything they don't have to. 7. Getting someone else to give you some final help and guidance: What you have in front of you is something you should be very proud of, especially since it's taken a great amount of time to construct. 1. Find a friend who knows you well to see if your personal statement is a true representation of yourself. 2. Get a family member who probably knows you even better, to suggest anything you may have missed out that is worth a mention within your personal statement. 3."	.

Each light bulb is then covered (about 10 inches from the bulb) with paper towels to diffuse the light's direct reflections. Another excellent diffuser that I am now using are those perforated cloth softener sheets (ex: Bounce) - the type you bung in the cloth dryer. The trick is to fiddle with the positioning of the three lights to eliminate shadows. If you notice in my images, I have very little in the way shadows cast on the blue paper underneath the vehicle - and that should be the benchmark. When there are no shadows – or little - then the positioning of the lights is perfect. It is not an attractive set up but as long as no one sees what is beyond the frame of the image, then it does not matter. * These two elements - lens and lighting - are key to bringing good images to better images. It’ll take some play and fiddling until you get precisely what you want. However, to attain good results with your lens and lighting, there are a few more steps that should almost become second nature when you start taking photographs. * My photography set-up is permanently in place so I just put the model on the desk, flick on the three lights, shoot and that is it. My images are by no means perfect and there are undoubtedly many more things and techniques that I could apply to improve the overall results. However, my set-up is inexpensive, low maintenance, and perhaps more importantly, it is easy to break-down and set-up.	My total cost (excluding the camera) for lights, bulbs, extension cord, tripod, and background paper is less than $70.

They want the same things, they have the same problems, and they have the same feelings. When you realize that, it will be much easier to realize how you should treat them: treat them how you would want to be treated. * If it's easier, think of how you would want someone to treat a woman that you love. Treat a girl the way you'd want your dad to treat your mom. Treat a girl the way you'd want a guy to treat your sister. 2. Stop trying to attract other women. You want to look fly all the time. That's understandable. Who wouldn't want all the ladies to fall over themselves whenever they walk through a room? However, if you already have a girlfriend or a girl you like, working really hard to attract other women is disrespectful and rude to your girl. Just worry about looking hot to her and don't worry so much about what other women like. *	You also shouldn't be showing off your body to other women.

Consider what kind of cyst you have. Most vaginal cysts are called inclusion cysts. These small, painless cysts usually go unnoticed and clear up on their own. If you have cysts that you can see on either side of your vaginal opening, these may be Bartholin's gland cysts. Normally, the glands secrete fluids that lubricate the vaginal lips and opening. But, these can become blocked, creating fluid-filled cysts. Less common types of cysts that develop inside the vagina include: * Gartner's duct cysts: these form during fetal development and they should disappear after birth. If cysts develop later in life, an MRI is usually needed to diagnosis them. * Mϋllerian cysts: these develop from fetal structures that should disappear after birth, but often don't. These cysts are filled with mucus and can develop anywhere inside the vaginal walls. 2. Watch for signs of an infection. While most cysts won't cause any discomfort, you may notice signs that the cyst has become infected. It's important to pay attention to these symptoms so you can get immediate medical attention. Signs of infection include: * A lump near the vaginal opening that is tender or painful * Discomfort when walking or sitting * Painful intercourse * Fever 3. Know when to see your doctor. You should call your doctor or gynecologist if you have any symptoms of infection or if the cyst becomes painful. A normal bacterial Infection or sexually transmitted transmitted infection can make the cysts uncomfortable. These require medical treatment. You should also let your doctor know if you have recurrent cysts, even if home treatments work. Recurrent cysts might need to be surgically treated. * If you're over 40 years old and have Bartholin Gland cysts, you need to have the cyst removed. Your doctor will probably want to have it tested for cancer. 4. Follow your doctor's treatment recommendation. In addition to testing the cyst for cancer, your doctor may want to treat infected cysts. Treatment can involve draining the Bartholin's cyst by inserting a tube that stays in the cyst for 4 to 6 weeks, or until the fluid completely drains.	.

Prepare yourself for entering into a land where over 90% of the population speaks only Spanish. Basic Spanish classes are recommended for a full, more confident experience in Peru. Travelers can get by without Spanish while within their tour groups, but one does miss a lot of the overall experience. Learning Spanish in groups or as a family can be really fun, and putting it into practice in Spanish-speaking countries can be really satisfying. 2. Research the destinations in Peru that you plan to see. The most popular destinations are Lima, Cusco, Machu Picchu, Lake Titicaca (Puno), Nasca and the adventure-filled jungles. All these places have well established tourist circuits, and it is advisable to stick to these for easier and safer travel. 3. Lower costs, by booking your hotels and tours early. You can travel to Peru all year round. However, Peru’s busiest tourist periods are during the dry season which runs from May to November. 4. Prepare in advance. Peru is a third-world nation. It's essential to be well prepared. Consult with your physician three months in advance and receive all relevant inoculations, some of which may be administered over an interval of weeks or months. If you are just traveling to Lima, you will probably not need yellow fever or malaria medications. The risk of disease is higher in rural areas, however. 5. Watch what you eat. It is very common for tourists to get food poisoning in Peru, as hygiene education is somewhat lacking there. Stay away from cheap restaurants and food carts. 6. Peru has a number of low-income, high-crime areas.	Don't carry a lot of cash. Be on the alert for bogus taxis. Use only registered cabs. The tourist board recommends that you never sit in the front seat of a taxi. Sit in the back seat directly behind the driver.

Plan any details, like what food you will buy and what films you will rent. Make sure you have all of it beforehand. 2. Clean everything up in the room you're going to host the sleepover in. The room has to be perfect and organized. Put away any clutter, put all makeup and beauty products in one part of the room, hide anything you don't want anyone to see (like a diary) and display anything you want to be seen (like an award), and run the vacuum cleaner around. When the room is clean you can start preparing for your sleepover. 3. Sort out the sleeping arrangements. If people are sleeping on mattresses on the floor, put the mattresses down and put sheets and duvets on them. Add lots of classy throw pillows. Try to arrange the beds head to head in a sort of rectangle, and put nice tables in between the heads of the beds. Decorate those tables with beautiful tables cloths and add a few table lamps on them. Try and use the space as well as you can. It's good if you have a bin somewhere in the room for food packets and stuff. If you have any mood lighting, like fairy lights or lamps, it's good because it creates an atmosphere. Everything should look like it's supposed to be there, with nothing out of place. 4. Invite your BFFs. Decide how many people you are having over, Blair usually has a crowd, but she invites her BFFs first. Depending on how many people you are allowed, invite your BFFs, then anyone else. Make sure it's okay with your parents; confirm with them a second time just to be sure. Make sure the drop off and pick up is arranged with your friends. 5. Arrange makeup and beauty products on a long table. Put your favorite glamourous clothes on racks and roll them into the sleepover room. Add mirrors and feather boas. 6. The food should be a decoration in itself! Put cookies in classy glass jars, fruit in expensive looking goblets, drinks in crystal bottles and a big bowl of non-alcoholic champagne on multiple tables. Arrange champagne glasses nicely (NO paper cups!) and add trays of french and italian desserts and grapes a bit everywhere. Add a special platter for hot drinks like coffee or hot cocoa, maybe even an old ffashioned tea set (but remember it isnt a tea party). 7. Start the sleepover! Blair starts her sleepovers at about 7pm. Start with makeovers, then go onto Gossip Girl; because Gossip Girl is fiction, start a Gossip Book and share all the gossip you know in it you could add to it each sleepover. Afterwards watch a movie. Follow this by doing each others nails. Afterwards there are plenty of things you can do, having fun is the main thing. Also make sure you have breakfast in store for the morning. 8.	.

Use_Piano_Foot_Pedals.txt	Inside_Revision	0.616	## Steps	164	Therefore , the primary use of the soft pedal is to manipulate sound quality .	## Steps	269	, the primary use of the soft pedal is to manipulate sound quality .	<delete><Therefore><1>	True	"Steps  1. Make sure that the end of the pedal contacts the ball of the foot in line with the big toe. The heel of the foot will remain on the floor at all times, while the foot remains touching the pedal at all times.This simple situation has complex ramifications.When a note is struck on the piano while the damper pedal is down, the vibrations from the strings of that note cause other strings to vibrate as well. These new vibrations are called sympathetic vibrations, and will mostly be pitches from the overtone series of the principal note. Since the resonance of the entire instrument is called into play, the chief effect of the damper pedal is a change in the sound quality of the piano. Therefore, the primary use of the damper pedal is to manipulate the sound quality.Basically, the quality of sound with the pedal in use is a fuller, more fluid resonance than without the pedal, which is a dryer, flatter kind of sound. This difference is easily heard.To lift and then to depress the pedal, starting from the down position, is to change the pedal. 2. It is unnecessary to raise and lower the pedal completely every time you change it. On most pianos, the pedal can be lowered nearly an inch before it connects to the damping mechanism. Don't waste time and effort moving the pedal through this empty space. It has no effect on the sound. If necessary, experiment, slowly repeating a staccato note as you lower the pedal by fractions of an inch until it starts to catch the sound. This is the level from where you begin each descent of the pedal and to where you allow it to return.The timing of the pedal changes can vary, with varying results. Most of the time, the pedal is changed immediately following the striking of a note. This produces a smooth transition from one sound to the next and eliminates blurring of sounds.When the pedal is depressed before the note is struck, all strings are available to resonate, and the sound will have all of its richness from the beginning. This is especially important to remember on the first chord of a piece or whenever the music continues after a rest.The pedal can be depressed exactly at the same time as the note is struck. Usually, the pedal and note will be released simultaneously as well when this technique is used: the hand and foot coordinate their down-up movements. This creates an accent on the pedaled note by adding a richness of sound to it while its neighbors remain ""dry"". 3. III. The Soft Pedal 4. Throughout the major upper section of the keyboard range, each note has three strings; in the lower range each has two, while the lowest notes have only one. On a grand piano, the soft pedal shifts the entire action slightly to one side so that the hammers strike one less string per note (or, in the lower bass range, the hammers strike off-center). This creates a sound which is more muted and less vibrant than without the soft pedal."	It is employed to create an atmosphere of mystery, other-worldliness, distance, inwardness, fantasy, et cetera. Unusual effects can be achieved by depressing the soft pedal to various intermediate degrees instead of all the way down. However, these are very subtle, specialized, and rare.

The hooks should be stable and should be ready to be baited. 11. ) The next step involves baiting the hooks. Hook the pieces of bait onto the shower hooks and snap them shut to lock in the bait. If you have fish heads, hook through the eye and out the mouth. If you have chicken necks, poke the hook through the part of the neck with the most meat. 12. ) At both ends of the trotline tie the chains to the rope. At the end of the chain, tie another piece of rope (approx 5 ft), and then tie this to the buoy. 13. ) Next tie whatever weights you could find to separate pieces of rope approximately as long as the depths you are crabbing in. Then tie the other ends of these rope to the buoys such that the weight rope and the trout line form a “V.” 14. ) Wind your rope up in a bucket so that it can be easily transported into your boat. 15. \- Phase 2: Getting it into the water: 16. ) Throw out first buoy and weight.	This ensures that it is spaced out evenly on the bottom.

Say something random to her, anything at all. Just look her way and blurt it at her and keep doing so until she notices. Chances are, if she has even a trace amount of feelings for you, she'll smile and try to stretch the conversation. If she just gives you a dirty look and turns away, it's okay, just go to the next step. 3. Talk to her. If your seat in class is in between or in front of her and her friend, join in on the conversation. If its not just a simple ""what are you doing for lunch today"" and its more like an actual conversation, maybe about the theme park she went to on the weekend, listen to the conversation if it's something that interests you and make a statement. 4. Hang around her. Pass by her and give her a few second-glances. If each time you look back, she looks at you or in your direction, she probably has a crush on you. Why else would she choose you out of the crowd? Also, in the classroom, make yourself known. Go up to the front of the class to throw something away or blow your nose. Look calm while doing it and strut back to your seat. Glance over a couple times to see if she's checking you out. If she does and looks away really fast, it's a done deal."	But even if she doesn't look at you at the moment you look at her, don't be worried; she's probably trying to hide her feelings (or at least not look desperate).

Decide what species of chameleon you want to get. Different species require different types of care. Some may take more time while others survive on there basic care and requirements. If you want to start off with an easier specie, it is suggested that you get a Veilded, Jackson's, or Panther Chameleon. A good time to purchase a chameleon is when it is 3-8 weeks old. If you are inexperience, it is suggested that you buy a chameleon older than 6 weeks old. 2. Consider a few things before deciding to buy a chameleon. Make sure you have the time and space to take care of your chameleon especially when it is an adult. A typical 6-8 week old chameleon can be placed in a 25-35 gallon reptarium. In a reptarium you have to make sure you can maintain it. When putting things inside your reptarium make sure you have some real plants, different sized climbing limbs, and proper lighting. Your enclosure should vary by temperatures so the chameleon is able to cool off and heat up. Make sure there is water available inside of the enclosure. Get a good quality and full spectrum lights that are UVA/UVB. They need it to produce vitamin D for absorbing calcium. 3. Meet the chameleon's needs in your enclosure or reptarium. Chameleons need a temperature at a certain humidity level. Your enclosures should also be kept clean. Take time and plan ahead when taking a vacation or going away for the weekends. Have somebody to take care of it So your chameleon won't get sick while you are gone. 4. Feed your chameleon. Chameleons usually eat insects so you should feed it regularly with crickets. You can buy them at almost any pet store. If it is not available to you, you can always purchase them online or by phone by the bulk. You can also feed your chameleon different varieties of insects they can include wax worms, meal worms, super worms, fruit flies(younger chameleons), flies, moth, and grasshoppers. Watch your Chameleons eating habits to figure out how much it may eat. Also watch any changes in there eating habit that may occur. Though there is no cause for alarm still keep a watchful eye. 5. Make sure you give your chameleon water. There is not one perfect way to keep your chameleon hydrated. There are many methods in keeping it hydrated. You can use a drip system. When using the drip system you can take ice cubes and put it on top of your enclosure and just let it melt.	You can also use the Paper/Plastic cup method. Take a cup and make a hole at the bottom of it and fill it with water. Place it on top of your enclosure. If you like you can buy a commercial drip system. It is similar to the Paper/Plastic cup method. Not only you can use a drip system you can try using the spraying/misting method. It is the most preferred method. You can use a spray bottle. You can buy one at any store. Spray onto the leaves in your enclosure. Chameleons usually drink off the leaves. Make sure the water is hot but not boiling. Try using a pressure sprayer if you like. Buy them at your local hardware store. They are like the spray bottle but it lets you set a very fine mist instead a blast to the face. You can buy an automatic misting system. These are somewhat expensive and a hassle to set up. You can manually give your chameleon water by using oral syringe and rodent bottle. Use a syringe without a needle attached. this can be bought at your local pharmacy. Drip it directly into your chameleons mouth. Sometimes it may not want to drink at the moment. Try next time and maybe it will. A rodent bottle is similar to the syringe. The ball tip is suppose to attract to your chameleon. Make sure you put fresh water in it and empty and dry out your bottle each time.

Or share a funny incident that happened with you. 2. Keep in mind who you are talking to. As the length of time you talk varies, whether it is a business call or a pleasure call. A business all is usually short, to the point and precise and formal and is basically about work. Whereas, a pleasure can be about anything, it can be lenghty, in formal etc. 3. Do not talk to much. Let the other person talk most of the time, simply keep the conversation going. Don't interrupt when the other person is talking, let him/her have his/her say. If you are the only one who is the talker the person will get bored and irritated. 4. Do not be on the phone too long.

The discovery of the atomic structure was a triumph to science in general and to chemistry and physics in particular. In the late 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century the discovery of the subatomic particles, the electron and the proton and the neutron have shed light on the particles that constitute the atoms. This discovery was possible due to the availability at that time of sophisticated instrumental methods that were used in experiments in physics that led to the discovery of these particles. 2. The nature of the atomic structure as is manifested by the presence of a nuclear structure that around it are circulating electrons in specific orbits of different energetic levels was achieved through two separate experiments that one of them is purely experimental while the other is theoretical formulation of the hydrogen atom structure by the Niels Bohr model. 3. The experiment that led to the discovery of the nuclear structure as a definite and distinct entity was done on specific type of neutral atoms in which were bombarded with alpha particles. Alpha particles are positively charged helium atoms that were forward in the direction of the specified atoms using a special type of alpha particles gun. The result of this experiment showed that the alpha particles were deflected from their straight line trajectory by a specific angle. This fact led to the hypothesis that a positively charged entity in the atom that is concentrated in its center is responsible for this repulsion of the alpha particles. This experiment was the first of its type for the elucidation of the atomic nuclear structure. 4. The assumption that there are electrons that are in constant circular motion around the nucleus was first postulated for the hydrogen atom structure. This model was proposed by Niels Bohr. This model which presumed that the electron is revolving around the nucleus in circular motion was a fairly good approximation for the atomic description of the hydrogen atom taking into account the limited experimental scientific tools at that time such as spectroscopic methods. The limitation of the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom was basically due to its inability to be applied to many electrons atoms. This model relied on the assumption of the quantization of the angular momentum of the electron that is revolving around the hydrogen nucleus. This postulate was further corroborated by the development of the quantum theory of light and matter. 5. The nature of the atomic structure both on the electronic as well as on the nuclear level was further understood by the development of the quantum mechanical methods and in particular the development of the Schroedinger equation. The development of the special theory of relativity led to the further understanding of the subatomic particles that reside in the nucleus. This was possible through the advent of the relativistic quantum mechanical equations in particular the Klein-Gordon equation which is applicable to particles with integer values of the spin and the Dirac equation which is applicable to non-integer values of the spin such as for electrons. The Solution of these two equations for particular systems led to the prediction of the existence of new particles on the subatomic level such as the neutrino and the positron. The solution of the Dirac equation also predicted the existence for every particle an anti-particle that is of opposite charge such as the positron. Also the discovery of the nature of the nuclear structure was possible through the solution of the relativistic quantum mechanical equations that led to the discovery of the potential energy function that depicts the behavior the strong nuclear force between protons and neutrons. This potential has a mathematical form that is ascribed to a Japanese scientist who's name is Yukawa. 6. On the electronic level the distribution of electrons in the atom in multiple electrons atoms was possible due to the successful application of the quantum theory to the hydrogen atom as manifested by the accurate solution of the time independent Schroedinger equation to this atom. The solution of the Schroedinger equation to the hydrogen atom gave a complete picture of the electronic structure of this atom and its energetic distribution around the nucleus in addition to the orbital functions that describe probability distribution of each and each electron around the nucleus. Also the solution of the Schroedinger equation to this atom gave new quantum numbers that specified the energetic level of the electrons and the shape of their orbitals.	.

Understand that you are not a mental health professional. There are some situations that cannot be handled by family and/or friends, no matter how much you love your parent, no matter how well-intentioned you are. If your parent seems truly serious, repeats the threat more than once, or makes an attempt on his/her life, realize that you are out of your depth and will need to call in professional help (911 will do for starters). 2. Assess lethal intent. The first thing to do when a parent threatens suicide is to find out how serious the threat really is. Sometimes, this type of comment or remark is simply meant to tell you how much pain your parent is feeling, so that you understand how serious his or her pain really is. Other times, this is a deadly warning. You can try following these ""sub steps"" to figure out what you're dealing with: * Ask if s/he is truly thinking about hurting him/herself. It seems counter to good sense to come right out and ask, but do it. The most important thing you can do for your parent is to let him/her know that you hear the pain. Knowing that s/he is actually being heard and taken seriously can be Step 1 to recovery, believe it or not. So try not to just clobber your parent, but kindly and gently say something like, ""Dad, it really hurts me to see you in such pain. When you said 'I feel like killing myself,' did you really mean that?"" If Dad says, ""I was just so frustrated..."" that means you can probably exhale. It does not mean he won't feel worse later, but it does mean he wasn't serious. If Dad says, ""I'm just tired of everything,"" that is much more serious. * Ask if s/he has a plan and/or the means to carry out the threat. Again, seems like something you should avoid asking, but nevertheless, this is not a time to get shy or nervous - a life is at stake. If Dad is 'tired of everything,' ask, ""If you were going to really do it, would you know how you'd want to?"" Again, you are trying to assess how lethal the intention here is. If Dad says, ""I'd probably use my gun,"" you need to figure out where the gun is. If it's locked in a gun box or locker, it's not as serious as if it's in the nightstand drawer."	"That is a serious threat, no matter how you cut it because Dad (A) has a plan (a gun) and (B) has the means (the gun) to carry out the threat. On the other hand, if Dad responds with something like, ""Oh, I don't know. Maybe pills? Something painless?"" this is a less credible threat. He is vague on the details. You can press a little and ask what sort of pills. A response like, ""Tylenol - lots of it. We have a huge bottle of them."" is bad (he knows what pills he is thinking of, and has enough on hand). Something like, ""Maybe I have enough sleeping pills and a couple of glasses of vodka...?"" is not as bad (he's unsure if he has enough to do the job and which pills he's even thinking of)."

Try some traditional home-grown shoe stretching remedies. There are a few things you can do at home to stretch your new shoes. * Wearing in: Wear the shoes in at home. Put on the shoes and move around in them on and off over a few days. Don't do this if it's painful, and only try this if the stretching needed is minor. It should work within a day or two; if not and it's uncomfortable, don't force yourself to keep walking around in shoes that are too tight. * Freezing shoes (leather, pleather, fake leather, etc.): Fill a hole-free sealable sandwich bag or similar plastic bag about one third to halfway with water and seal, one bag for each of your shoes. Place a bag inside each shoe and push into place so that it fits the inner shoe completely (be sure it fits right to heel and toe). Place your shoes in the freezer and let them sit until it freezes, or overnight. The water in the bag will turn to ice and expand into your shoes. Remove from the freezer and leave to thaw for about 20 minutes before trying to remove the bags. Try the shoes on again to see how the shoes fit and repeat if needed. It's recommended that you don't use this method on expensive shoes. * Thick socks and heat: Put on thick socks and squeeze your feet into the shoes (leather only). Heat the tight area of the shoes using a hairdryer and bend your feet back and forth as much as you can for 20-30 seconds. Remove the heat source but leave the shoes on until cooled. Try the shoes on with your normal socks or stockings. Repeat until the shoes have stretched enough. Once stretched, apply leather shoe conditioner to restore the moisture that might have been depleted by the heat. * Damp newspaper: Scrunch up wet newspaper and stuff it into your shoes. Stuff in as much as the shoe will fit but be careful not to distort the shoe shape when using this method; if the shoe appears distorted, remove newspaper until it looks a good shape again. Leave to sit until the shoes dry. Remove the newspaper and try on the shoes. There should be more give. (Note that this method can also include freezing the shoes for added expansion.) Wet socks can be substituted for newspaper. * Oats or grain: Try this old cowboy trick for leather boots. Fill your boots with oats (or any grain that swells up when wet). Pour in enough water to cover the grain. The grain will swell overnight. Then wear them for a few days until your feet get adjusted and the boots become dry. * Rubbing alcohol spray (home-made shoe stretcher): Make a spray of 50 percent rubbing alcohol and 50 percent water in a spray bottle. Spray the inside of each shoe and wear for about 20 minutes. An alternative to this is to simply rub alcohol directly onto the parts of the shoe requiring stretching; put the shoe or boot on while still wet, as the alcohol will dry quickly. Another variation is to take a pair of cotton socks, soak them in rubbing alcohol and squeeze out the excess.	Repeat several times if necessary.

Purchase your tickets well in advance from the online website. Disneyland is large, so buy multiple-day tickets if you want to experience the whole park and resort area. However, if you don't plan to visit both parks, there are also options for just single-day visits. You can buy Disneyland tickets from their official site at https://disneyland.disney.go.com/tickets/. 2. Plan your flight and car reservations if needed, as well as your hotel accommodations. Hotel accommodations for onsite hotels (such as the historic Disneyland Hotel, Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa and the Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel) can be made on Disney's Disneyland website when you sign in. Any offsite accommodation bookings will need to be made separately, and there are many travel websites out there offering deals on air travel, car rental, and hotel stays. 3. Preview the attractions online. There are videos from the point of view of the rider available online for almost all Disney rides. Check YouTube and other similar resources. You won't find quite the same video resources for hotels and all Downtown Disney attractions, but you can find descriptions and photographs. 4. Make sure you know the park hours. Although this will vary by park (and whether or not there's an Early Admission option), the parks are generally open from 9 AM to 10 PM Pacific Time. However, some park events will force it to close much earlier or later than that on select nights. * Make sure you plan enough time to see it all. Your exact trip will vary depending on your goals and the ages/needs of those traveling with you.	.

I ran up the stairs of the back porch and barged into the large kitchen, and almost made my grandpa one with the floor."" 2. Develop a good plot. It's kind of hard to concentrate with a weak plot.

If you ask them too many questions they will feel uncomfortable and without showing a single bit of it, they wouldn't like you for that. So give them space. 3.	Tell a Scorpio something about yourself and they will most likely remember it. But try not to tell them everything all at once, because then the Scorpio wont have anything to be intrigued about you--cause they like to slowly gather information and once they have it all, its less interesting.

Recognize the symptoms of ringworm. If your baby has ringworm, they made have round rash spots on their skin. These rashes will be red or pink in color and have scaly borders. The center of the rash may also be scaly or it may be smooth. The rash spots usually are between half an inch to an inch; however, they will slowly grow larger. * You may notice that your baby is itching the areas where the rash is. * Ringworm may be confused with some kinds of eczema in infants. * Ringworm is more common in children in school than in babies. 2. Visit the doctor. If your baby has ringworm, the first thing you should do is take them to the pediatrician. The doctor can examine the infected areas and be able to diagnose the ringworm by sight. They can tell you if the rash is in fact ringworm or if it is another condition. * You should make sure to take your baby to the doctor if the ringworm is on the scalp. * Never try to treat your baby’s ringworm at home first before taking them to the doctor. You might misdiagnose the ringworm or not use a remedy strong enough to get rid of it, which could cause the condition to worsen. * Most cases of ringworm are mild and treatable by at home care methods.	You should immediately seek medical treatment if your baby's ringworm has any pus coming from the rash, the rash is still spreading after a week of treatment, the rash has persisted for more than four weeks, tour child has additional spots popping up on their body, or your child’s condition worsens.

Change your wording. It doesn't always have to be the vanilla ""Thank You"". For variance, try phrases such as, ""I appreciate that,"" ""That was nice of you/kind of you,"" and ""I owe you one,"" preceding ""Thank you"" or ""Thanks."" The added emphasis will show greater thoughtfulness and consideration for the other person. 3. Be specific.

You can't decide getting on the bed one night is fine and unacceptable the next. * For instance, ""No dogs on the furniture,"" is a house rule that everyone needs to agree on. Otherwise, the dog will get confused. * You should also agree on things like feeding times, who's going to walk the dog, and a place for the dog to sleep. * Decide what words you'll use for each command. For instance, you don't want one person to use ""crate"" and another to use ""bed"" for the same command. 2. Start at the beginning.

Plus, the rules you want to establish may be different from the last house it lived in, so it's best to just start teaching your rules right away. *"	Start teaching toilet training the instant the dog gets in the house.

Be sure to choose a Friday you know all of your Clique can come to the party. 2. Make cute invites! Write a list of the people in your clique (generally 3-5 people) that you'd like to invite. Then, make invitations. These can be on Facebook, e-mail, text, phone, IM, or face-to-face, but e-mail or mail is usually best. E-mail invites can sometimes can be tacky, so if you choose to use them, use a fancy brand like Papyrus, and send them out. 3. Pick the room you will host the sleepover in. Pick a big room so you can do a variety of things. Pick one far away from your parents room so you won't wake them up. DO NOT have it in your bedroom, as personal things will be messed with or misplaced. Also, it's im-pawsible to fit your entire clique onto your bed. Another bad place to have it is in your living room. It may seem perfect because it has a TV, couches, carpet, all that stuff, but it makes your party less private because when you and your friends could be gossiping your parents could be eating next to you. A great place to hold a sleepover in your house is a furnished basement. 4. Clean the room you have decided to have your party in. Move all the furniture that will interfere with the sleepover out or to the edges of the room. Dust the remaining furniture and vaccuum the carpet/flooring. Set some sweet pea or lavender candles out on a small table or counter. Keep it away from the sleeping area of the room. Lay some comfy blankets on the floor around the room. Close the doors to the room to keep it untouched. * Remember, no movies allowed! Massie specifically said in ""Invasion of the Boy Snatchers"" that DVDs are off limits at her sleepovers. Still, keep the remote near unless you want to watch some TV. 5. Unroll the sleeping bags in a poke and wheel formation."	"Make yours at the ""head"" of the room, being the host and alpha.

Consider your reasons for the divorce. Divorce is often threatened during heated arguments, usually out of anger or frustration, to gain power and control over the other person, and to finally be taken seriously that you want real change. * Remind yourself that divorcing your partner is a huge decision, mentally, emotionally, and financially. You will also need to be willing to let go of a strong emotional attachment to your partner, so you should try to make the decision to get a divorce from a clear, unemotional standpoint. * Ask yourself: What is my intent in getting a divorce? Any other agenda, other than ending the marriage, is an indication you may not be ready to get a divorce. If you are hoping that through the divorce the other person will change and start treating you better, or realize how much they have hurt you, you are getting a divorce for the wrong reasons. Divorce has no power to right wrongs or change people’s hearts. Divorce can only end your marriage and your relationship with your partner. * Keep in mind that spouses who consistently threaten divorce can lose credibility with themselves and their partner. So, if you are serious about getting a divorce, you will need to express this to your partner in a clear, but appropriate way. 2. Try not to blindside your husband. In most cases, both spouses are usually aware there is something wrong with the marriage. You may have tried marital therapy together, done individual counseling, or had discussions about the troubles in the relationship. If possible, try to pursue counseling or therapy together first before jumping into a conversation about divorce. * If the feelings are mutual, you and your husband will have more options. If your husband has no idea, it can be a devastating conversation. Surprising your husband with this difficult news may also result in a more difficult transition for you both during the separation. 3. Practice what you are going to say. This is going to likely be a very hard conversation to have with your husband. So get out a piece of paper and write down a few possible things you may include when you tell your husband about the divorce. * Keep in mind you are about to break some bad news that will probably evoke strong emotions. Compose a few sentences that do not contain strong language or an angry tone. * Focus on using neutral language. Make “I” statements, such as: “Michael, I have some difficult news to tell you. I have reached a conclusion that you and I need to divorce.” * Avoid giving any false hope to your husband if you are serious about the divorce. Saying something like: “I haven’t been happy for a long time. But I want to see if we can work on some of the things that are troubling me” will give your husband the impression you want to fix the marriage. So if this is not your intent, avoid statements like this. 4. Find a private, quiet space. Choose a time when you are both alone and no one is going to barge in during the conversation. Look for a space in your home, like the living room or the dining room, that is quiet and comfortable. * Turn off your cell phone and ask your husband to do the same. If you have children, ask a family member to watch them while you talk to your husband, uninterrupted. 5. Have a third party in the room if you are worried about your safety. Perhaps you are divorcing for troubling reasons, like your husband’s angry or abusive behavior. If this is the care, have a third party present like a therapist or a counselor, or choose a more public place to talk to him. * You cannot control how well or how not well your husband takes the news. But if there is a history of violence or abuse in your marriage, make sure you have another person in the room with you. * You can also tell your husband over the phone if you are concerned about your safety and do not want to be in his presence when you tell him the news. 6. Get a restraining order if you are concerned about your safety. If you are trying to divorce an abusive husband, it's important to have a plan in place to protect yourself and your children, if you have any. A restraining order can give you a legal way to create distance between you and your husband. * The most dangerous time for an abused woman is the first 24 hours after a restraining order has been issued.	You can also contact your local shelter to see if you can stay in a safe house until things are settled.
