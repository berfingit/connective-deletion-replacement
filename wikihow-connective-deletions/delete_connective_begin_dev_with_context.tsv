Realize that the amount of musicianship required to write and play most metal is astounding. A lot of ignorant people say otherwise, because they're used to mainstream bands that are based on poppy vocals backed up by simple power chords. How many times have we metalheads been told that metal is just a fat sweaty guy screaming into a mic? That's too bad, because people like that are missing out on some great instrumentals. 2. Realize that metal is ALL about the music. You don't need to go around wearing fancy clothing or acting a certain way. Just be yourself. 3. Don't just listen to the vocals. Appreciate the drumming, guitar riffs, and the heavy bass lines. If you can't understand the vocals the first time around, look up the lyrics. Understand what they mean, analyze them and form your own opinion around them.	.

Place your lower magnet rotor onto the studs. You can either make your upper and lower magnet rotors with a rotor plates, epoxy, and 2"" by 1"" by ½"" neodymium magnets, or you can buy this part prefabricated as part of a wind turbine kit or from a wind turbine part manufacturer. In either case, be careful whenever you handle individual magnets or the magnet rotor plates. The magnetic forces of these are very strong, and can cause serious injury if not handled with caution. With the magnets facing up, fit the bottom plate of your magnet rotor onto the four studs you have fastened to your flange. * Neodymium magnets are fairly brittle. You'll need 24 of these, 12 for your top magnet rotor and 12 for the bottom one, but you might want to purchase extra in case one breaks during construction of your plate. These magnets are available for purchase online. * You'll want your magnets equally distributed around the edge of your rotor. To prevent misplacing a magnet and potentially ruining your magnet rotor, draw a magnet placement template on card stock or paper. This template will occupy the middle of your rotor where the magnets will not be. Lines, extending to the edges of your template, will indicate where magnets should be placed on the rotor. Tape can be used to hold your template in place. * You should mark the polarity of your magnets before you begin placement. This can be done with a marker. If your magnets get jumbled together and you cannot tell the polarity, make a tester by gluing a weak magnet to a popsicle stick. Pass ""N"" polarity side of your tester over the neodymium magnet. If you feel a push, the magnet is the same polarity. If you feel a pull, the polarity of the magnet you are testing is opposite. * Use a pea sized amount of epoxy when mounting your magnets. This should be applied to the bottom of the magnet. Being careful to keep your fingers from between the magnet and rotor, slowly move the magnet to corner of the rotor plate. The magnet should grab onto the plate, and then you can slide it into the correct position using your template. 2. Place spacers on your studs. You can use /"" (.375 cm) metal tubing cut into 1¼"" (3.175 cm) long segments to create your spaces. You should cut these as accurately as you can; spaces that are unequal in length could create a slated position for your upper magnet disk. This could be dangerous, and could also negatively impact the efficiency of your turbine."	.

Talk to a seller about their horse. Before making the effort to go see a horse, you should have a detailed discussion with the seller about the horse's temperament, experience, and history. This will give you a better sense if this horse is possibly the horse for you. * This discussion can also give you information about whether the seller is someone you want to do business with. Ask them about how they care for their horses, what their history with horses is like, and other questions that can help you determine if they care for their horses well. 2. Schedule an appointment to see a horse. Before making your choice, you should have the chance to thoroughly evaluate a potential horse. This is point at which you can gauge the horse's behavior, personality, and comfort with being a trail horse. * If a seller does not want to let you spend any time with a potential horse, walk away from the sale. You should be able to get to know a horse a bit before buying it. 3. Bring somebody along with you to evaluate the horse. Make sure the person you bring along is knowledgeable about horses and can offer an objective opinion. They will be able to give you a second opinion and will be a good resource for questions you need answered. * Also bring along a video camera to make a video of the horse. This way, you can watch the video later at your leisure to help you make your decision. 4. Look the horse over from a distance. Before you approach the horse, look it over from a few feet away. If it looks well balanced, sound of body, and calm, continue with your evaluation. If it doesn't look good and seems nervous, sick, or otherwise unsound, leave. * Tell the seller politely that you are not interested in buying the horse.	.

Many people worry about their physical appearance -- you're not the only one! * Many people say they find ""a good personality"" attractive, so whether or not you feel physically attractive as well, this may be another way to attract others to you. * Decide if physical appearance is what you want to focus the most on. If you are looking to attract people who put a lot of emphasis on appearance, they will make a lot of demands for you to keep up your own appearance. For some, it's more satisfying to find people who are attractive, but don't think of it as their only mission in life. * Ask for honest advice of those you trust about your physical appearance."	It may be more useful to identify to yourself what you want to change, and then ask for advice on how to do it. For instance, if you want to be more athletic, ask advice of a particularly athletic friend for becoming more physically active. If you want to pull off the hipster look, ask a friend who's already rocking it out -- they'll probably love to help you!

Study both the movie and the book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire so you will know what Beauxbatons is and know a little about the school. For example, you will notice the Beauxbatons girls wear fluttery blue robes and hats. They walk gracefully and are always polite. The Beauxbatons students act like they are better than everybody else-and they are! They are completely confident with everything they say and do. Incorporate these traits into your everday life, and you will slowly become more Beauxbatons. 2. Learn French. Every student in that school speaks French and most students also know English.If you can't, just throw in little french phrases into your speech, like ""Bonjour"", ""Merci"" and ""Salut!"" If you don't learn french in school, you could try learning french out of a book or online. You could also google Fleur Delacour quotes and copy her graceful, intelligent way of talking. 3. Visit a costume site or search on Ebay for a Beauxbatons costume. If you can't, wear light blue as often as you can, and you could try a trilby. 4. Wear your hair in a pony tail and on formal occasions just make it look gorgeous. 5. Make your bedroom more elegant and ""Beauxbatons"" like, by printing out the school logo and stick it in your bedroom and you can try to make a part of your room like a four-poster bed.Get a desk where you can do your French homework and write down new spells you learnt. Keep it tidy. 6. Be calm and serene. Try not to be boring though! Never get angry or frustrated, but if you do, don't show it! The Beauxbatons girls are always calm and quiet. Don't bore people with constant spouts of knowledge, and don't seem overly confident. 7. Be smart and do well at your school."	As threatening as they might look, the Beauxbatons girls are actually very friendly and caring. Look after a friend in need or take the new girl under your wing.

Average starting pay is $19,000 for cargo and REGIONAL airlines. When you upgrade to captain at a REGIONAL airline, you can expect to start out on average at $50,000 per year. Expect to take a substantial paycut if you decide to move over to a major airline once you have the requirements to apply there.After getting more seniority in a major or international airline, you could make up to $200,000 dollars or more. * Don't be afraid to look for an instructor at a local airport rather than a big school. While a big school has a lot of advantages, remember that their instructors are generally low-time recent grads from their program. On the other hand, you might find a retired airline captain, military aviator, or maybe just a life-long flying enthusiast with a lifetime of real-world flying experience to share with you instructing at a smaller, local airport. * Be sure to do your research before jumping into your flight training. Use a reliable source for this information and not marketing from flight schools. Online forums, asking pilots, visiting flight schools to ask about the experience of their instructors are a good way to find out about a school's reputation. Be sure to ask current students what they think of their training privately where they feel free to talk. Be sure to ask if they are flying as much/often as they had originally planned and if not, why not. *	Believe that you will become a pilot and you will.

Check for any leaks and check the flow of water to make sure the current won't be too strong for your betta. Bettas do NOT like currents, and this stresses them out. 2. CUP METHOD 3. Get the cup with your betta in it, and float it at the top. You want your betta to get used to the water and it's temperature. Leave it for 10-15 minutes. 4. Now, slowly, using a turkey baster, take some of the tank water and put it in the cup, while letting it float. The betta needs to get used to some of the tank water. Leave this for 5-10 minutes. 5. Add a little bit more of the tank water. Wait for another 5-10 minutes. 6. Repeat this step another time. 7.  Now, you are ready to release your betta! Take the cup and pour out some of the water, but make sure the betta can still breathe!!! 8. Now, using an aquarium net, gently take your betta out of its container and move it into its new tank. Be gentle, as you do not want to poke your finny friend. 9. BAG METHOD 10. Float the bag at the top, but make sure the bag has enough air so the betta can breathe. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. 11.

You can also buy one of those little water fountains for pets that continually cleans the water. 3. Take your cat to the vet regularly to get a check up and its vaccines. You may also want to consider getting your cat spayed or neutered to minimize spraying and midnight howling, which are behaviors which cats in heat display. Also, fixing your cat will prevent any unwanted births. 4. Cats can clean themselves, however they need a little extra help with maintaining a healthy, mat-free coat. Buy a brush/comb that will suit your cat's hair length.	Cats with long hair, such as Persians, need to be brushed daily, while cats with short or medium fur only need to be brushed 2-3 times a week. Keep in mind that cats, like humans, need oral hygiene as well. You can get toothbrushes made especially for cats at your local pet store. Tooth paste is available as well although it not necessary. Your cat may also spit up hair balls. Hair balls are clumps of fur that get lodged in a cat's throat when they lick themselves. So don't worry if your cat vomits every once in a while, only if they appear to be sick. It is a good idea to put cat grass in pot around the house, because grass helps reduce the build-up in the throat.

Keep in mind that cats, like humans, need oral hygiene as well. You can get toothbrushes made especially for cats at your local pet store. Tooth paste is available as well although it not necessary. Your cat may also spit up hair balls. Hair balls are clumps of fur that get lodged in a cat's throat when they lick themselves. So don't worry if your cat vomits every once in a while, only if they appear to be sick. It is a good idea to put cat grass in pot around the house, because grass helps reduce the build-up in the throat. 5. Scoop the litter twice daily to keep it clean.	This will help to make the cat's area smell a bit more pleasant, and make the tray more appealing to use rather than your carpet.
Call_London.txt	Begin_Revision	0.867	### Gathering the Necessary Numbers	1471	So , for an international call , the mobile number would only have 10 digits .	### Calling London on a Phone	1513	For an international call , the mobile number would only have 10 digits .	<delete><So><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><for><3><For><1>	True	Gathering the Necessary Numbers  1. Find your exit code. The exit code, also called the international call prefix or the dial out code, is the number that allows you to dial outside of the country you are currently in. Different countries have different exit codes. For instance, the exit code for the United States is 011, for India it’s 00, and for Nigeria, it’s 009. * You can find the exit codes by contacting your phone company or doing a quick internet search. Just type in the name of your country followed by “dial out code” or “exit calling code.” * In some countries, such as Brazil, you might have multiple exit codes to choose from. In that case, the different codes are tied to different providers, so you should use the code associated with your phone company. 2. Get the national prefix or country code of the country you are calling. The country code is typically 1-3 digits long and identifies the country to which you are placing a call. 44 is the country code for the United Kingdom. * Do not use the exit and country codes to call London if you are already in the United Kingdom. * The International Telecommunications Union, the United Nations agency that assigns country codes, has a list of the country codes for each nation. 3. Obtain the area or city code if you are calling a landline. These are 2-5 digits long (not including the first 0) and are assigned by geographic area. These codes always begin with a 0, but this 0 is not used if you are calling from outside the United Kingdom. * For example, the area code for most of Greater London is 020, but if you are calling from outside the UK, you would use 20. * Ofcom, the government agency that assigns area codes in the United Kingdom, has a tool on their website in which you can enter a UK number and it will list the appropriate area code. 4. Determine whether the phone number is for a landline or mobile phone. In the United Kingdom, mobile phone numbers are usually 11 digits (not including the exit or country codes), and they usually begin with 07. * It is important to recognize if you are calling a mobile number because if so, you will not use the area code. * If you are calling a mobile number in London (or anywhere else in the UK) from another country, you will drop the leading 0.	Instead of dialing 07XXX XXX XXX you would dial 7XXX XXX XXX (plus the appropriate exit and country codes).

Their work includes mental health, where they help people in all aspects of their daily lives to succeed in their life roles (parent, worker, friend, student, etc.). Occupational therapy is a holistic profession, and deals with any physical, cognitive, or emotional issue that keeps a person from succeeding in the areas important to him/her. You can find Occupational therapists working in schools, hospitals, the military, nursing homes, rehab facilities, pediatric practice, wellness programs, community agencies, substance abuse rehab, private practice, and many many more places. Occupational therapy is a skilled allied health profession whose unique value is the use of individualized, purposeful activities as the basis of therapy. A career in occupational therapy requires a master's degree for entry level, although many people also earn a doctoral degree. Therapists must pass an initial certifying exam given by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy, and be licensed by their state. Each state has its own continuing education requirements. The American Occupational Therapy Association offers more information for potential students on its website at www.aota.org.

Care_for_a_New_Navel_Piercing.txt	Begin_Revision	0.834	## Steps	19	However , you must not stop cleaning until you have totally healed .	## Tips	63	You must not stop cleaning until you have totally healed .	<delete><However><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><you><3><You><1>	True	Steps  1. When you first get home, do NOT touch or move your piercing at all. It may still be a little sore because your body is getting used to the metal object in your skin. Just leave it under your top. 2. After a few hours of having it done, you can get some salt (Rock salt is best) and boiling water in a small glass. Allow the water to cool slightly and then lean forward and put the glass on your stomach, then lean back, if you do it right you will get a seal between your skin and the cup so nothing will leak. It can be trickky at first but after a while you will get the hang of it. Now with it on, kill 10 minuets, the salt will clean it. 3. After you have cleaned it with the salty water, you need to dry it. Don't use a towel ot dish cloth because these carry lot's of germs. Instead use a clean bit of tissue and gently dab it. You must do this for about 3 - 4 months until it has healed compleatly. 4. Bathing / showering. It is best if you have a shower, because it's a stream of clean water constantly. However if you must bathe, do not put any bubble-mixture, strong bath oils, soap, in the water because this will irritate it. Instead have the water clean, and bath as you would usually. Do not wash your hair in the water (Because your hir carries alot of germs too) and do NOT shave any part of your body while in the bath. Because the small hairs may get caught in your piercing. Instead you can shave and wash your hair after, without getting your piercing wet. 5. Sleeping. If like many people, you find yourself sleeping on your stomach (which is a problem) you can try this trick I used. 6. If your bed is a single bed - Grab some spare pillows, and pile them up on one side. You can do this better if you lie on the bed. Put enough space for you to lie on your back, and then put the pillows on the remaining space. Now in your sleep, if you try and roll over you will be stopped by the pillows, or you will stay on your side. You have to try it a few times to get it right for your body shape, but it's a good trick. 7. Clothing - Most clothing will be fine, but stay away from tight ristricting clothes. Big belts are bad, because your body needs to get air, and the belt will not only put pressure on your piercing, it will limit the fresh air getting to it. Try and wear cotten or other soft fabrics, because these will irritate you less. If you know you are going to have to wear some kind of itchy clothing (P.E uniforms for school can sometimes be irritating to your skin) you can buy an eye-patch and put it over the piercing and then take it off after you have gotten changed. 8. For most people, the healing time is no more than 6 months, however everyone is different, for some it takes up to a year, it all depends on your body, for example if you have a good diet with plenty of vitamins and have a good emmune system, you are more likely to heal faster. 9.	If you stop cleaning it early, you have a chance of it getting badly infected which could result in you having to have the piercing removed compleatly, which would be a waste of time and money. So make sure you are cleaning it twice a day until you are sure it has healed.

Feed the red-eared turtle appropriate food.center|550px A proper diet for red-eared turtles (and similar aquatic turtle species) should have the following proportions: vegetables and water plants 50 percent, commercial foods 25 percent, and live protein 25 percent. Red eared turtles are content to eat food made commercially for turtles and food you've foraged for them * Good vegetable choices include: Dandelions (the ones in your yard are good if you don't use pesticides), carrot tops, mustard greens, romaine lettuce, carrots, bell pepper, and squash. * The best greens are water plants like anacharis, water hyacinth, water lettuce, frogbit, hornwort, and duckweed. While expensive in a pet store, these are easy to grow in a separate tank or pond, and they are cheap if you buy in bulk online. * Red eared turtles don't usually eat fruit in the wild, so avoid it except for an absolute treat. If giving a treat, bananas are a good choice. * For commercial food, look for something that has low protein and low fat. Dried shrimp are an absolute no-no! While turtles love the taste of dried shrimp, they offer no nutrients and turtles may refuse other foods for weeks. 2. Check your turtle for signs of health problems.center|550px There are various conditions and diseases that can occur if the tank water is dirty, if the turtle's diet is inadequate or for other reasons. Some more common concerns to watch for include: * Eye infections: The eyes will appear closed, swollen, puffed up or discharging. You may see pieces of tissue coming off. Eye infections are caused by bacteria. The turtle should be seen by a vet and probably needs a topical antibiotic plus upgrading the tank's filtration system. * Soft shell: If your turtle's shell is softer than it's supposed to be, your slider may not be getting enough light from your overhead light. If this happens, the turtle's dock may be too small, the water may be too deep, or the turtle is too weak to get on the dock. If this happens, contact your vet or a pet store. It can also mean that it has metabolic bone disease. * Furry mouth and refusal to eat: Your turtle has a bacterial infection and should be seen by immediately by the vet for an antibiotic treatment. * Weak, wheezing, lethargic and holding head at an unusual angle: This may be a respiratory infection, such as pneumonia. Immediately take your turtle to the vet. * Wounds: Check the tank for sharp objects or a fighting mate. Remove the cause, treat the wound with povidone-iodine solution, and keep it clean. See your vet for more advice. 3. Take your turtle outside sometimes for direct sun.center|550px You must supervise outside time, to prevent overheating. One approach is to get a kiddie pool, fill it with some water, and provide something for the turtle to bask on. Make sure to offer some shade for your turtle so it won't overheat. 4. Spend time with your turtle.center|550px This is your pet and you'll form a bond, as with any pet, if you spend time together. Handle with care––not all turtles like being handled. * Some turtles love to have their shells gently scratched, just like a back scratch, or scratching behind a dog's ear. However, be careful, as not all of them enjoy it and may try to bite.	Be gentle.

Next, turn on the water in your sink or tub.	After that, squeeze a quarter sized amount of puppy shampoo into your hand and gently massage into the coat, including the back, sides, neck, front legs, back legs, bottom, withers, tail, and chest. After massaging the puppy's body, gently rub shampoo on the head and work your way down from forhead to muzzel, and try to avoid getting shampoo into puppy's eyes. Next, gently rinse your puppy completely until all traces of shampoo are gone, then repeat with conditioner. Be sure to rinse completely. Then gently and carfully lift puppy onto a dry towel, and wrap puppy in it and hold for 15 minutes in towel to absorb most of the water. After holding the puppy for 15 minutes, it should be lightly damp but not sopping wet. Put the hair dryer on lowest setting and carfully dry fur as needed. After drying fur, gently comb and brush the puppy's whole body well. Your puppy should now be a cute, soft, silky, plush, adorable, and fluffy little shih tzu prince/princess. Use other towel to dry up any water.

Before rushing out to purchase a fish, it is important to first do your research. Many species of fish cannot coexist with each other within a small tank, and many species can grow to be quite large. Start by asking yourself the following three questions below. Once you have a general idea of the type of fish you want, you may also need to purchase additional hiding spaces or plants to make their adjustment as stress free as possible. Many fish will have a similar reaction to a new habitat, which includes hiding from anything and everything for upwards of a week. As with any animal, it is important to provide them with a place to feel safe and call their own as soon as they are introduced to their new home. * Do I want a fish of function? - Many fish aren't just pretty faces, they actually contribute to the well-being of the tank by cleaning up algae stuck to the walls, gravel or plants. Some even eat the poop of other fish, which sounds disgusting, and it is, but it's healthy for them and helps keep your tank sparkling! * How big will it grow? - While sharks are awesome, they tend to grow to a fairly large size, making them the less than ideal fish for the typical home aquarium enthusiast. Try to find a fish whose maximum size will not be more than 1/5 of the total length of the tank. This will allow them to grow to their maximum size comfortably, and allow them to stretch their fins every now and then. * Are my current fish compatible? - As previously stated, many fish are not suited for living within close proximity to other species of fish. For your convenience, I've included a chart to help quickly and decisively determine whether or not your desired fish will be a good fit. 2. Once you've decided the type of fish for your tank, it's time to research where to purchase one. Many aquarium stores have a wide selection of fresh and salt water fish available for purchase; however, some of the more exotic species may require you to travel to a specialty fish outlet or breeder. You may even be required to order one from overseas. In many cases, the aquarium store will be able to place your special order for you, and will inform you when your new fish has arrived at the store. 3. Acclimation is a very important step in introducing a new fish to your tank, and failure to do so properly could result in the death of the new fish. Many stores will present your new fish to you in a small plastic bag containing some water from their old habitat or tank. The old water contains familiar smells and pheromones that calm the fish and provide a friendly environment for transport. The bag is not a cheap alternative to traditional packaging, the fish is presented in a bag because the walls of the bag are thin enough to transfer heat and acclimate to the surrounding temperatures. This will be explained in further detail in the next step. 4. As soon as you arrive home with your fish in their bag, place the bag in the water of your aquarium and let it float there. Do not open the bag! The water the fish was living in at the store or previous location is most likely warmer or colder than that of your tank, and simply dumping the new fish into a water with a drastic difference in temperature can cause the fish to go into shock, preventing their gills from filtering the oxygen out of the water, effectively drowning them.	.

Plan for your level of commitment. If they have agreed to serve as your mentor, then you will now need to begin formalizing your relationship. Think about the level of time commitment that you and your mentor have. Perhaps you might ask for a lunch meeting that lasts one hour per month or a thirty minute phone call every few months. 3. Do the work and follow through. Once you begin to meet with your mentor or speak to them regularly, they will likely begin imparting invaluable life and career advice to you. Honor their time and wisdom by following their advice.

Go to the Ice Rink and act like a cheerleader! Say things like ""Go Team!"" Make an entrance! Say things like ""Walks In Sassy!"" The best thing to do is as follows:] * Walk into the stadium and be sure to make a big deal out of your entrance. That way, people will notice you and that you're new. * Say, ""Parks Silver Topless BMW In Reserved Spot"" or ""Parks Stylish Blue Motorcycle In Reserved Spot"" or ""Parks light blue eye catching no top ferrari"" (Try to go on the servers Abominable and Alaska) * Say, ""Is New Gurl From (insert country)"". Normally any place, but try to make it one of the countries in Europe and somewhere not too weird! Popular places are Paris, Cali, Aussie, e.t.c. * Walk up to the wall where everybody is standing. * Say, ""Opens Glittery Pink Locker that Says (insert name here) in Gold/Black/Silver/Pearls/Rhinestones, e.t.c * Good names that go through the filter (on a side note, the word name does NOT go through the filter!

Have the Split-Level igloo, or the Candy-Split Level igloo. If you have no coins, then just make sure the igloo you have looks cool! 2. Always talk in capital letter for the beginning of each word. (Always Talk Like This!) And Put An Explanation Mark After Everything You Say! 3. Act flirty, cute, and perfect. (As if you had no flaws!) 4. Always say stuff like, ""Puts On Midnight Mascara!"" ""Applies Mango Tango Beak Gloss!"" ""Adjusts Extreme Midnight Skinny Jeans!"" ""Flips Caramel/Blonde Curls/Waves"" ""Sprays New Vanilla Bean Hollister Perfume!"" ""Looks at Matt/Drew/Austin"" Texts Everybody Whats Up?"" ""Walks With Confident Natural Sway !!"" ""Walks With Confident Eye Catching Natural Sway!!"" 5. Never go to the Forest. Always hang around in the Gift Shop, Nightclub, Town, Stadium or Coffee Shop. If people are advertising parties or boys meet girls, go there. 6. Never talk to nerdy people, 'plain' people, or the goth/emo people. Basically, anyone who's not a prep. (People will think you're one of them!!) And leave behind your ""nerdy"" friends. 7. Make sure you have a boyfriend. If you don't have a boyfriend, you just won't be the perfect prep. Be very flirty. Say ""Bumps Into!"" Guys will think you are desperate and it's just annoying. If he is new, say something like ""Looks at Drew""."	"They will say it's Girl's Choice! Ask him to go, he will say yes. Or, you can start talking and the guy will probably start showing off like saying ""Lifts Weights!"" You should say something like ""Whoa!"", ""Wow!"" or maybe if your really desperate ""Wow! Looks At Muscles."" Then after awhile, it's time to say bye. Say stuff like ""Looks At Diamond Watch! Oh I'm Late For Practice! OK I'll Cya Later *guys name*! Bye!"". Always make sure you don't follow him, make him follow you. If you follow him, he will know you're desperate and he'll think it's annoying. If another preppy girl that's as good as you talks to him, just ask him out to coffee. Either way you should ask him out. He will remember you and when prom comes, you will be an option.

For example Hard times Tokens were merchant tokens and patriotic tokens which circulated in the 1830's and 1840's and were the size of a large cent. Civil War tokens were patriotic or store card tokens which circulated during the civil war. Good Luck tokens were often issued by merchants and had good luck symbols.

First, decide whether you want EDTV or ""true"" HDTV. EDTVs have fewer pixels on the same size screen and are generally only available in 42"" or smaller screens. Many people find it hard to tell the difference between the cheaper EDTV plasmas and the higher resolution HD displays, but the best way for you to decide is to go look at the same program on the two TVs side by side at your local retailer. 2. Check in some stores to determine for yourself whether you can see a difference from the distance from which you will be watching. If you can, decide how much you are willing to pay for that difference. 3. Next, decide whether you want a consumer or a commercial set. 4. Determine which features you need, which are ""nice, but not critical,"" and which you are unlikely to use. Consumer sets have more features, flashier styling, and (sometimes) better warrantees, as well as having to meet somewhat more stringent government standards. Commercial sets offer great value. They provide very good PQ for the money, but tend to be minimalist in styling and features, and things like table stands, HDMI/DVI inputs, tuners and speakers are extra cost options that can drive the cost up beyond the consumer version if you add them. 5. Consider whether want to buy on the internet or from a B&M. The former is usually less expensive, but if something goes wrong, returning the big, expensive machine could be a hassle. Commercial sets are scarce in B&M's while many internet vendors do not offer the consumer versions. 6. Focus on a manageable number of models by weeding out those that don't meet your criteria. 7. Check out ""expert"" reviews, such as CNET and Consumer Reports. Read user comments on various sites all over the net. Reviews are invaluable, because choosing a TV set on a sales floor is difficult and frustrating. 8. Look at the sets you are considering in more than one store. Too much depends on the picture settings, ambient lighting, and even the quality of the feeds. I compared my two finalists, the Panasonic and a Sony in several locations, preferring the Panasonic PQ in some stores and the Sony in others. It was a close call, but in the end, I chose the Panasonic as a better value, with its lower price and built-in HDTV tuner (which I use for 80% of my viewing). I'm delighted with it, but my choice is not necessarily yours. 9."	There will always be something new arriving soon. Prices will always drop over time.

Find an activity that you like to engage in regularly. * Hobbies give you a chance to pursue and develop new skills, relax, and meet people. Try joining an interesting club or organization at your school or in the community that’s not related to academics. Join a swim team at the local YMCA. Volunteer at an animal shelter. Learn to play a musical instrument. 2. Stay physically active. Regular exercise is an important element to leading a healthy life.

In which the legs are crossed and both knees resting flat on the floor. The Half Lotus Position- This is done by placing the left foot onto the right thigh and tucking the right leg under your left thigh. The Full Lotus Position- This is by far the most stable of all positions. It is done by placing each foot onto the opposite thigh. This might be slightly painful at first but keep trying and the muscles in your legs will loosen up. The Chair Position- It's perfectly fine to sit on a chair but it's essential that you keep your back straight. The hands are folded in the cosmic mudra. This is done by placing your dominant hand faced palm up, holding your other hand also faced palm up. The thumbs are lightly touching.   1.

After going swimming your hair is drenched with chlorine which can damage hair. After swimming take a quick shower. Most swimming places have showers that you can shower before and after in. Wash your hair with your regular shampoo and conditioner. 2. When you get home its best not to dry your hair with a hair dryer. Let it air dry. This prevents burning your hair or causing that chlorine smell to stick around. Also you should not apply any products like hairspray or dry shampoo Etc. 3.

If you can’t do your homework before the trip, you are relying on the dealer to present a fair price. Depending on the artist or piece, that could be good or bad. If you want an expense piece badly, don’t bid the first day. During a 7 day cruise, you’ll have an average of three auctions. So pass on the opening day, but take note of the art and artist of the pieces you like. Then, when you have the time, head for the Internet Café (which all newer ships have) and Google and research. See what’s been sold and educate yourself. Then wait for the next or final auction, armed with knowledge, which means power. *	If it does go up in value in the future, then great. But that’s not always the case. Instead, buy it because you can afford it and you like it. There are both good and bad deals onboard. Lie in the casino, don’t bet the farm. The main thing is to have fun and come away with a positive experience. Bon voyage and happy bidding!

To earn a 2.000 rating, a passer must perform at exceptional levels, i.e., 70 percent in completions, 10 percent in touchdowns, 1.5 percent in interceptions, and 11 yards average gain per pass attempt. The maximum a passer can receive in any category is 2.375. 3.	The NFL record is 70.55 by Ken Anderson (Cincinnati, 1982).

"""""""" Or , """""""" My eyes look pretty in this light ."""""""	### Changing Your Perspective	3448	"""""""Look in the mirror and think , """""""" Wow , my hair looks great today ! """""""" Or , """""""" My eyes look pretty in this light ."""""""	<delete><Instead><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><look><3><Look><1>	True	Changing Your Perspective  1. Think positively. You may think that some people are just naturally more positive than others. That’s not necessarily wrong, but don’t let lazy thinking keep you from making a decision to be more positive. If you want to feel comfortable in your own skin, then you have to start thinking about the best thing that can happen to you instead of always expecting the worst. Any time you catch yourself thinking negatively, fight your negative thoughts with at least two or three positive ones. Make an effort to rationalize your negative thoughts away and to expect good things to happen to you; the more you expect good things to happen, the more they will. * Let’s say you’re going to a party where you won’t know a lot of people. If you catch yourself thinking, “I’m probably going to spend all of my time hanging out alone by the pita and hummus,” you should fight off that negative feeling. Instead tell yourself, “Maybe I’ll make a new friend tonight,” or “I’ll have a great time catching up with the few people I know.” * Negative thinking keeps us from embracing new opportunities and putting ourselves out there. Sure, not everything you do will turn out for the best, but the more you try, the more you’ll gain. Remember that half of your success will come from just showing up. 2. Stop banking on compliments. You may suddenly feel great about yourself when someone tells you that you look amazing, or when a friend compliments an aspect of your personality. But the compliments will come and the compliments will go, and at the end of the day, your self-worth shouldn’t depend on what other people say about you, whether it’s good or bad. A compliment can make you feel better, of course, but you should never depend on them. Get used to complimenting yourself instead. * There’s nothing wrong with feeling a little burst of happiness after a compliment, but you just can’t let them define you. * Instead, work on giving other people compliments when it feels right. Feel good about making other people feel good. 3. Develop your confidence. Being confident is the key to feeling comfortable in your own skin, and it’s obviously easier said than done. Confidence comes from within, and developing your confidence means feeling good about who you are, where you are, and what you have to bring to the table. If you can’t stand what you see in the mirror and feel like you have nothing to contribute to a conversation, then you can’t move forward. Work on finding at least a few things that you love about yourself, and with being happy with how you look instead of getting lost in self-consciousness. * Developing confidence takes a lifetime. But you can’t start until you make a commitment to start changing the way you feel about yourself. * The next time you’re hanging out with other people, stop obsessing about how you look or sound and enjoy the moment of the conversation. This is the first step to making your doubts disappear. 4. Get comfortable with your flaws. Nobody’s perfect, and the sooner you realize that, the sooner you can learn to love yourself and change the way you feel. Figure out what your flaws are – maybe you have really stringy hair, maybe you think you’re too tall, or maybe you just tend to be a little socially awkward. Whatever your flaws are, write them down and get comfy with them. Don’t deny that there are things about yourself that aren’t ideal. * The next step will be working on changing the things you can change and accepting the things you can’t. * Look around you. How many people do you know who are truly perfect? Chances are, the answer is zero. And if you really think someone you know is perfect, then you probably just don’t know that person well enough. 5. Remember that it only matters if you think you’re beautiful. It’s great if your boyfriend, best friends, and everyone around you thinks you’re beautiful, but that doesn’t matter one bit if you’re convinced that you’re ugly. Even a supermodel can feel completely insecure and inadequate, and what you think on the inside is much more important than how people view you on the outside. Know that the first step to feeling beautiful is really thinking that you are beautiful, flaws and all. If other people agree, then great, but in the end, it really makes no difference. * Stop staring at yourself in the mirror, bemoaning all of your imperfections.	But best of all, stop wasting so much time looking in the mirror.

Many countries allow it but some have restrictions. You should confirm it that your regional laws allow it. Otherwise, taking any further steps will be less useful. 2. Meet individually with some scholar of your religion and ask about the validity of polygamy. Even if you do not follow any religion, it is still really important to know the views of the local religious authorities about polygamy. Religious laws about marriages are usually included into the legal laws of courts in many countries. 3. Take advice from your family members. Talk with your closest family members about your thinking of polygamy. Ask them of their views about it. It is best to find out if there have been anyone in your family or relatives, who have done polygamy earlier. Meet them if possible. 4. Write down answers to following questions on a paper. * How much are your current expenses? * Will your new partner be a house wife? * Can you provide seperate accomodation for your new wife? 5. The answers of above steps will help you analyze better if you are really ready enough to afford another marriage. marrying another woman will obviously bring more responsibility upon your shoulders. But if you see that you have good financial resources and can provide seperate accomodation to your new wife, you are good to go. 6. Try to build a close rapport with the family of the woman who you wish to marry beforehand. It is always nice to send marrigae proposals through your parents or any elderly family members who can eagerly do this for you. 7.	Marriages are based upon trust more than the ceremonial fancy.

Care_for_Your_Chihuahua_Puppy.txt	Begin_Revision	0.926	### Feeding Your Chihuahua Puppy	1029	However , human food is often very calorically dense and can cause weight gain , which is very common in Chihuahuas and is dangerous for their health .	### Feeding Your Chihuahua Puppy	1154	Human food is often very calorically dense and can cause weight gain , which is very common in Chihuahuas and is dangerous for their health .	<delete><However><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><human><3><Human><1>	True	Feeding Your Chihuahua Puppy  1. Feed your puppy a healthy food. Like other puppies, Chihuahuas need nutritious diets to keep them healthy. They do not need to be fed a specific diet but you should ask your veterinarian for brand recommendations. * Like other small dogs, Chihuahuas are at risk of developing heart and kidney problems if they are fed a diet high in salt. Look a dog food that is low in salt to help avoid this issue. * Chihuahua puppies need more protein and calories than adults so look for a nutrient dense food. * Canned puppy food may be easier for your puppy to eat at first since it is easier to chew but dry kibble typically provides better nutrition. 2. Feed on a schedule. Chihuahua puppies have very small stomachs but very fast metabolisms. They need to be fed multiple times a day to maintain their energy, maintain their blood sugar levels, and to help them grow. How many times they need to eat a day will usually depend on their age: * For the first six months you should feed your Chihuahua four times a day. * From six months to one year of age they should be fed three times a day. * After one year they will reach maturity and can be fed twice a day. * Feeding on a schedule is very important during housetraining since you can predict that your dog will need to relieve themselves about half an hour after eating. 3. Always provide water. Chihuahua puppies can become easily dehydrated since they expend a lot of energy throughout the day. Always leave out fresh clean water for them in a bowl that is shallow enough for them to reach into and won’t tip over. * Puppies may try to climb into water bowls if they are too difficult for them to drink from and can drown. 4. Avoid foods that are toxic to puppies. There are a number of foods that are toxic for dogs to eat. Even very small amounts of these foods can be very dangerous for Chihuahua puppies because of their small size. * Alcohol, caffeine, avocado, chocolate, grapes, dairy, onions, garlic, and salt are all dangerous for your dog. 5. Avoid feeding them table scraps. It can be very tempting to feed your Chihuahua puppy some of your food or leftover scraps.	.

Get to know yourself. The fact of the matter is that you will always be you. Always. When you're someone you're not, eventually that person fades away and you return to you. This is the person you'll be working with, so get to know yourself! You'll be more comfortable in your own skin -- you'll be a better person, a better friend, a better boyfriend/girlfriend, a better employee, a better everything. You'll be less stressed and you'll be more confident. You'll know what you're working with and how to work it. Sold yet? * Know that you are not your brand or what people think of you. This has nothing to do with anything. You will not be happy if you create an image that caters to the world around you and not to you. If you became the best lyrical soprano this side of Vienna, would that really matter if you truly wanted to the next John Lennon? No. So cater to no one. Find yourself and work with it. 2. Be original. There is no one else out there who is you. Therefore, you are the best you there is. But if you are trying to be someone or something else, that logic goes out the window. You become a second-rate copy of whatever it is you're trying to emulate. No matter who you are (or who you think you are), commit to it. This is the hand you've been dealt. Can't win if you don't play it. *	You can't copy others. You have to do new, innovative things. You have to study biology when you want to become a computer scientist. You have to be yourself to avoid being someone else. Crystal clear?

Make yourself happier at home. Talk with friends and do fun stuff for a while until you can't keep that happiness bottled and need to let it out. 2. Start at school by making sure your head does not lower and your hair does not go in front of your face like a cover. Keep hair off your face, put that hood off your head, and wear bright cheery approachable colors like orange and green. Walk assertively. 3. Make eye contact. If you cannot do that, look at their shoulder or something near their eyes. 4. Don't hide! it'll make you seem like you don't want to talk. 5. Smile or laugh at jokes, this makes you more noticeable. Tell some too. 6. Smile a lot. Its better when someone looks around and sees this bright happy person with a beautiful smile than just not noticing you in the background. 7. If you for sure know the answer to the question then raise your hand. If its wrong then just shrug it off (this also attracts some attention towards yourself without overdoing it). 8. Make sure you are talking with your friends because (maybe) that is where you feel most comfortable. 9. If you feel so shy that you can't talk much to your friends then just add in a comment once in a while. 10. Don't be phony. Keep the friends you have as your friends. You don't want to push them away and then not be accepted by others. 11. Don't stress about being cool. Teen society is generally not really worth it. 12. Pretend!!Walk and talk like the person you want to be ,not the person you are.Act like you know that you are smart,hot,funny,talented and AMAZING!!! 13. Act like you are always happy and comfortable;this will make you a people magnet,not in a horrifying way but people will definitely wanna get to know you and that includes your crush. 14. Once you get used to it,the acting will stop and it will become natural. 15. Don't be an air head but definitely take the time to feel good about yourself.Dude,who wouldn't wanna talk to you when you feel like that? 16. Take risks!!! You only get one life!!Work hard at your goals,laugh a lot, 17. love everyone you can and trust yourself. Make a point to do something that you have wanted to do but also scares the hell outta you. It might be hard at first,but the more you do it,the more proud of your self you become.	.

Be as academic as possible! Try your hardest in class and get on the good sides of all your teachers. Be hardworking and always make time to revise and study if you have a test, Cho is one of the brightest students at Hogwarts. 2. Be organised and neat. You never see Cho with her shirt half tucked in or food down her skirt. Also make sure to get a diary or planner, so you can organise your week and make sure you are on top of everything. Furthermore, tidy your bedroom often, dusting and hoovering. Remember, a tidy room is a tidy mind! 3. Have natural beauty! As well as being intelligant, Cho is well known for her beauty. Use face washes to rid achne and spots, wear natural makeup to hide imperfections, and also make sure your hygiene is good. Take a shower every day, wash your hair well and always make sure you look your best. Keep your body healthy on the inside and out. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables, drink lots of water and get at least thirty minutes of excersise a day. Just little things such as walking up stairs rather than taking the lift, and walking your dog count towards this. 4. Be social. Cho is known for being popular and having many friends. Get out there and maybe join a new club, or perhaps eat lunch with a different person to normal. This may sound hard to do at first - but trust me, it works! 5.	Although some people may think that Cho is rather innocent, she has be known to have a lot of boyfriends and drift from one boy to the next. Do not do this though, just try talking to your crush or getting to know them more; it will bring you closer to them, and one more step to being like Cho.

Have men's clothing tailored. Women's clothing generally require less fabric than men's clothing. However, it's often priced up anyway. If you're handy with sewing, you can buy products like men's jeans and tailor them to your body type. You can also ask a friend to take in a dress if you know someone handy at sewing. * Professional tailoring is unlikely to save you much money, however. If you don't know how to sew, and do not know someone who does, it may be more cost effective to simply pay slightly more for clothes. 2. Go for men's deodorant. Besides a certain fragrance, there is little difference between men's deodorant and women's deodorant. Yet, men's deodorant is generally around 20 cents cheaper per ounce. To avoid the pink tax, go for men's deodorant when possible. This will save you money over time. * If you dislike the scent of men's deodorant, go for unscented varieties. 3. Try men's razors. There is very little difference between men's razors and women's razors other than the color. A razor targeted at men will work the same as a women's razor, and it comes at a much lower price. When buying razors, always opt for men's razors. 4. Think about men's toiletries. Oftentimes, the only difference with toiletries (i.e., face creams, soaps, lotions, adult diapers, etc.) is something small, like the fragrance or the color of the bottle. If you're going to be washing out these products anyway, do you really need to pay extra for a smell? Does the color of the bottle really make a difference? When there does not seem to be a big difference between the products, opt for men's products. 5. Stay away from gendered toys. Many toy stores sell girl toys for me because of the color or design. In most toy stores or department stores, you can easily spot the girl's aisle because it's decorated in shades like pink and purple. To save money, avoid this aisle and get boy's toys of the same variety. *	.

First ensure to have a flawless base. If you have oily skin it is recommened to use a primer to make your makeup last throughout the day. Whether it's foundation, powder or just some concealer make sure it gives the overall look of a good complexion. A beauty blender is a good tool to use if you want to have flawless base as it will make sure your foundation does not turn cakey. Make sure to use less and build up your coverage if needed. Do not apply lots as it may turn cakey. A powder foundation or mineral makeup will give a much lighter coverage but still flawless. 2. Next powder your face if you have used liquid foundation or concealer. Even if you have dry skin this is a crucial step as you do not want your makeup to move throughout the day. If you are dry then use powder lightly or in some places and if you're oily then it is recommened to use all over your face. Make sure you do not powder too much as it may turn cakey. Also do not buff or rub as this may disturb and move the makeup. Lightly bounce on the skin and once applied all over then buff into the skin. 3. Next add bronzer. This will add a lot more definition and colour to your face as opposed to making your face look washed out, Apply to the edges of the forehead, cheeks and jawline. Use a big fluffy brush as this should not be too precise. 4. Next contour. This is where the most definition will occur making our face seem more structured and less round. This will also give the impression of a precise cheekbone and jawline. Apply with an angled thin brush and apply to your natural indentation and blend up for a more natural look as blending downwards will make your face look sunken in. 5. Blush. You can use a matte or shimmery one. Using a shimmery one will bring attention to this area and make your cheekbones more prominent. Apply right above the contour. 6. Apply a highlight to the tops of your cheekbones above the blush which should be on the apples of your cheeks and the highlight should be above it. Use a pink one for lighter skin tones and a golden ones for deeper skin tones. 7. Apply eye makeup to your eyes. Colours to make blue eyes stand out are golds and copper and for brown eyes purples will make them pop. Apply eyeliner if desired and which ever mascara you prefer. 8.	.

If you are one of those people who over think or analyse everything then you will understand the effects; you lose self-esteem and become stuck in this vortex of worrying. But you have to understand that this is not only making you seem needier, you are breaking yourself down. * Don't keep thinking about what you did wrong or what they did wrong. It's in the past. You can't change it, you can only prevent it from happening again, so stop stressing. Every time you go to sleep do you rethink your break up or start regretting things? Stop and breath. It's in the past so think about the present. * Also stop stressing about why they don't like you or why they have a grudge against you, you can't read minds. And don't think about texting them because it can seem clingy and you don't want to push them away further. 2. Stop Attaching To What Things Mean * It's common to create ideal situations in your head. It can become the habit . But when these situations don't work out in real life you may feel disappointed and heartbroken because you might feel that these situations will never come true. This is what some call "" Digging a grave for yourself "". If you do this with every relationship you have, you'll never be happy. Your worst enemy is usually yourself because people convince themselves that these situations were going to happen, they set their standards way to high, so that the only persons who could reach them were themselves. Once you realise that your partner is just a person and that they aren't perfect either you can get somewhere. *"	If they stare at you a couple of times or even everyday that doesn't mean they like you. You can't tell what other people like or don't like based on habits or what they do, you can only assume so just live in the present and stop trying to figure out the future.

Begin with the end in mind. In order to make the right choice, you need to know what you're going to use the land for, and how soon you want to do it. This is especially important if you're getting a loan to buy the land. People buy raw land for a variety of reasons: * Farming/livestock * Building a home * Investment based on development of area in the future * To diversify one's portfolio. 2. Save enough for a down payment. If you're getting a loan, lenders might ask for as much as 50 percent down, although 20 percent is ideal. An alternative is to get a home equity loan or construction loan. 3. Decide where you want to buy. This is by far the toughest step. Buying land is a big commitment — especially when you plan on developing it. If you don't already know where you want to be, and you're cost-sensitive, look online. There are many databases of available raw land. A browse through these sites will give you an overview of the kinds of properties that are out there and what they cost. 4. Pick a few properties to follow up on. Mark them on a map. It's a good idea to try and mark them in ""lots"" so that you drive to one area for one visit and then another area on another visit; that way you'll avoid huge drives in a single day or weekend. 5. Call the seller. Have a list of questions prepared to ask over the phone. You can, of course, email your questions, but it's much better to actually talk to a seller and get direct answers. Some key questions might be whether or not the property has a water source, utilities, or restrictions; whether is it paid off; why they're selling; whether there is there any owner financing; and whether any structures already exist on it and if these structures all have building approvals. * One of the most important things to ask about first is whether there is a proven source of water on the land. You'll also want to know if the land can support a septic system, and if it can be placed far enough away from the intended structure to avoid contaminating drinking water. The cost of drilling a well and installing a septic system will depend primarily on soil type, and the final price tag can vary widely as a result. 6. Look at the land. Nothing will clear up your ideas about what kind of land you want better than actually looking at some properties. You'll immediately realize what appeals to you, and what you don't want. Walk the property, take photos, find the property boundaries, and investigate things like structures or creeks or wells. * Look for any structures on the property or on a neighbor's property that cross the property line."	.

Understand the personality of a group you are trying to befriend. Figure out what unites them -- is it a shared activity (e.g., debate team, journalism publication, love for performing music) or a harmonious balance of personality traits (talkative, sociable, quiet, etc.)? If you share this unifying quality with the group, then let your interest/personality/whatever it may be shine! Invite people from the group to do things with you that you know they will enjoy, and attend events if you receive invitations from them. Once they realize that you're a fun person to be around, you all will become friends. * Remember that each group will be different. They will use different words, find different things funny or respectable, or will have very different ways of ""hanging out"". Observe what is appropriate for each group, and act accordingly, but don't change yourself just to fit in. You are who you are. 2. Be outgoing and proactive in inviting people to hang out and paying attention to when/where people are gathering. If you want to be friends with everyone, you have to initiate reaching out to groups and sensitive to their habits. Go out a lot in order to hang out with different groups. Being friends with everyone can be very time- and energy-intensive because you must be friendly, outgoing, and willing to spend time hanging out, leaving yourself very little time to yourself. * Remember, you don't have to be outgoing in order to be a good person; it's perfectly fine to be shy and reserved, and you will make your own friends. However, if your goal is to befriend a wide range of people, you will have to put that effort out there. 3. Ask people what their plans are for the weekend. If something seems appropriate for you to join, you can express interest in the activity and see if they extend an invitation. If not, you must make a judgment call about whether you should put yourself on the line and explicitly ask to come. * Be careful about always tagging along -- it can make you annoying to some people. Tagging along is only a problem when the group doesn't genuinely enjoy your company, which may be tough to detect because people generally try to hide their true feelings and to be outwardly pleasant. If you notice that you are routinely left out of plans, or don't hear about things until the event is over, realize that people may be subtly but intentionally trying to exclude you. While you may see this as a hurtful action, others do not have the obligation to be your friend, and if they feel that your personality doesn't jive with the rest of theirs, it's their prerogative to decide whether to include you. If this happens with people whom you were long-time friends with, you may want to confront your friends about their spiteful behavior."	.

Develop a realistic workout schedule. Set achievable goals and decide what you want to accomplish from working out. Set a goal that has a concrete result, like getting your mass index (BMI) to a certain number, losing a certain number of pounds, or being able to see that six pack of abs. * If you are new to working out or are returning to the gym after a long period of time, start slowly. You won’t build your body fast by pushing yourself too hard and getting injured. * It may take longer for you to see results if you haven’t kept a consistent workout schedule, so stay patient and consistent. 2. Determine your situation and goals. Be realistic about your overall schedule and how much time you can devote to working out. Maybe you only have 30 minutes a day to work out, or you have a few days a week where you can do more. * Knowing how much time you can devote to building your body will help you develop a schedule and routine that will maximize your growth. * Aim for between three and five workouts per week, depending on your schedule. If you can only workout a few times a week, try to block out enough time so that you can workout for about 75 minutes. * Evaluate your current fitness level and experience. If you are newer to working out, then you want to populate your schedule with less strenuous workouts at the beginning to prevent injury. 3. Target your whole body. The fastest way to build your body is to train multiple muscle groups at once, and make sure that during your weekly routine you are training every part of your body. By training multiple muscle groups at the same time instead of just focusing on one, you get to exercise these groups more often, leading to more frequent growth stimulation. * If you decide that you can realistically workout three days a week, build a schedule that will allow you to workout your whole body by the end of the week.	On day two, train your back and biceps. On the third day, train your legs, or do some cardio training like running or stairs.

OK, first of all you need to go over some rules. Even if you know a cool magic trick, it might not have as much effect on crowd as you wanted it to have. Go over this ""Six Golden Rules of Magic"" and be sure to follow them! 2. Rule 1: Never warn the public about what you're going to do in your act (unless it's part of the plan to fool the public), or the magic trick will not look as great as it could be 3. Rule 2: Never show the same magic trick right after doing it the first time, no matter how much the audience begs you. Only exception would be if you know another way to do the trick. 4. Rule 3: Never explain the secret of the trick (unless you're not going to use it in your program) to anyone just to show off your ""mad magic skills"", cause it can spread pretty quickly. If you plan on writing a book ""100 Best Magic Tricks Explained"", make sure you produce very few copies (5 or so), so that whoever get it are the only ones in their community who have it. 5. Rule 4: Never perform the trick if you haven't practiced it enough. You have to be an expert in your tricks and they should be very easy for you. If the tricks are hard to perform, don't rely on your luck. 6. Rule 5: Don't be embarrassed if you mess up in front of your public. If you can't fix it without anyone noticing, just play along with your public. Laugh with the crowd as if the trick was planned to be unsuccessful, then move on to the next trick without making any comments on last one. 7. Rule 6: Never argue with the audience. If someone makes a negative comment (for example, ""I think I saw an extra penny behind your back!""), don't be distracted. Just ignore the comment and continue the trick. Be humorous and only answer public's questions/comments (if necessary) after you're done with your trick. 8. To be a successful magician, you also need to have some tricks of your own. No one wants to see an unoriginal magic act being performed over and over. Of course, you should have some (or many) old, famous magic tricks in your act (such as pulling the bunny out of a hat). Public never gets tired of old classics. Here's how to think of your own original tricks: Think of an idea that has never been done before. For example, make strings disappear from a guitar. Then, think of a way to make the trick convincing. Make some equipment, if necessary. You might even need duplicate object with which you're working on. Once you've got all the parts planned out, start practicing the trick."	Don't steal other's styles, cause that makes you even more unoriginal even if you perform your own tricks. It's better to have unique style and perform previously performed tricks, rather than take someone else's style and perform your own tricks.

Try to get a magician to guide you. Once you've gained some skills, reach out to a local professional magician and ask if you can be an apprentice and give you some helpful feedback. You'd be surprised by how helpful many professional magicians can be, remembering themselves when they were starting out. You just have to be receptive to feedback and be ready to take some criticism that can improve your craft. * He might not reveal you any tricks, but he could give you tips on how to perform your first tricks like a pro. If you don't have this advantage, try to learn from your mistakes as much as possible. Over time, you will know what your audience wants most. 2. Be original. Once you've mastered the basic tricks and have gained your footing as a magician, then it's time to be your own kind of magician -- you can't just rely on the tricks of others if you really want to succeed. No one wants to see an unoriginal magic act being performed over and over. Of course, you should have some (or many) old and famous magic tricks in your act (such as the cups and balls). The public may enjoy some old classics (like the Miser's Dream), but you should avoid certain old classics, like pulling a rabbit out of a hat (instead make it appear in a box). *	For example, make strings disappear from a guitar. Then, decide how you will accomplish the effect. Now, think of a way to make the trick convincing. Make some equipment, if necessary. You might even need duplicate object with which you're working on. Once you've got all the parts planned out, start practicing the trick.

Get a costume!! Pick a color that looks good on you: blue, pink, green, orange, purple,yellow, etc. If you want, find ones that have flowers or leaves on them. Those are typically called “nymph” costumes, and you can find ones for each season. Most costume stores have wings. Claire’s store in the mall has some smaller ones, but just as cute. * If you decide to make your own costume find patterns at a craft store, or Wal-Mart, and then buy the fabric. Usually the fabric you’ll use can be velvet, tulle, sheer, iridescent, etc. You can probably find used dresses and skirts at thrift shops which can be altered and decorated to your liking. * To make a fairy skirt, you can simply take ribbon or an elastic band (the size of your waist or hips, depending on where you wear it), and then take pieces of tulle or mesh fabric (the length depends on how tall you are), and tie them to the ribbon or elastic. Do enough of it so that when you wear it, it's not see-through. (But please do wear shorts underneath, we can't take any chances.) With the ribbon you can simply tie it, with the elastic you’ll need a way to fasten the back, either with Velcro, or a snap button. You could make large petals out of felt or fabric and attach them before, or after, you tie the tulle. Whatever works for you. * As for a top, you can create one if you’re good at sewing, or find a renaissance style shirt (which can be dyed if need be), or a top that's airy and isn't too heavy. Wands can be bought, or made. You can make wands using wooden dowels with foam stars, Styrofoam balls covered in fake flowers, with ribbon, and whatever else you can find. Use your imagination! * If you want a “crown”, that's simple! Take a headband and glue a fake butterfly, and/or some fake flowers to it. Or, take a few hairpins, or bobby pins, and glue it to that. Put them throughout your hair. Pretty! 2. For makeup, use glitter. Glitter makeup of any kind will work. Plus lots of bright colors (unless you want to be a dark fairy, then go with purples and blacks) Paint your nails, use blush and eyeshadow, face paint, etc! Whatever you want, will work just fine. 3. Try to be in the right environment. Well you can't be a real fairy, if you’re not anywhere near where a fairy should be. Woods, streams, and a backyard full of flowers and hiding places will do. Or you can create your own fairy garden. * You can't fly, but you can sure as heck feel mystical and magical.	When you believe you are a fairy, and you sit outside and you create your own magical world, you’ll know when you feel something strange. It's that chill up your spine. That feeling that something is watching you. And the tiny hints of laughter, that dance among the wind. Only then, can you truly be in a fairy environment.

That feeling that something is watching you. And the tiny hints of laughter, that dance among the wind. Only then, can you truly be in a fairy environment. 4. Get the right scent. Part of being a fairy is having your own fairy smell. Now sure, you can buy any ‘ole perfume, or you can make your own. You can buy a perfume kit, which include different smells that you can mix and match to create one as unique as you are. You can also buy natural oils, which come in most health food stores, and add them to some water, in a spray bottle. Add a little fine glitter in it for some sparkle. Most fairy smells include flowers, fruits, chocolate, rain, cotton, etc. Depending on the type of fairy you are, create a perfume to match. 5. Pick your Talent. You’ll notice that the fairies in the Disney series, all have talents. Animal, Water, Garden, Earth, etc. Whats yours? To determine this you need to pick one that you love most. Do you love animals? Then you have an animal talent. Do you love flowers? Then you have garden talent. Knowing your talent will help you determine the smell of your perfume, the color and accents on your costume, and in your make-up, and how to set up your garden.For instance.If you are a water talent fairy wear blues and have a bubbly scent 6. Use Your Talents. Now that you found your talent use your talent. Help animals, clean water, tend to gardens, etc. The fairy garden will have elements of all the talents. 7. Decorate. If you plan on creating a fairy like aura in your home or room, or even your backyard, you’ll need a few tips. Fairy yard art, and statues will bring a little fairy magic to your home. You can also find fairy doors and windows for your trees, or fairy homes. Now if you’ve got a lot of money, and you want to spend a lot of money, there are three things you can buy to deck out your backyard. There’s the toadstool chair and table set, the giant butterfly yard art, and a fairy castle. 8. Create some fairy dust. Now what would a fairy be without her fairy dust? Just as unique as your perfume is, your fairy dust is too. Now, sure you can buy some glitter at the craft store, but you’ll want to add things to it, to make it magical. Make sure the glitter is fine, as fine can be. Chunky glitter is a fairy no-no. Pick a color of your choosing (similar to the colors you picked out before, and your fairy talent). Add a few drops of your natural oils (same as perfume, for the most part). You can also add in some dried flowers crumbled up (crumble them nicely please!) for an added touch. Shake it up good. Put your fairy dust in a cute necklace container, or in a jar (which you can decorate) or wherever you want. Use it for decoration, for fairy trails, etc. 9. Come up with a fairy signature. Not a writing signature though, a physical one. For instance, if your fairy talent is garden, then your signature can be little dried pansy flowers.	You get it? Something small to represent your talent, and you. You can use your signature when you create things, including your fairy homes, and in your garden.

Measure the distance between your shoulders. For the best workout possible, find the distance between your shoulder blades using a tape measure. For most people, this number will be between and . This distance will help you determine how much PVC you’ll need. 2. Mark your pipes for cutting. Most PVC pipes come in long, unbroken stretches, so you’ll have to cut them down to size yourself. To do so, find the distances needed using a tape measure and record them on the pipes with a thin marker. For a small set of dip bars, you’ll need: * 2 top bars, each long or however long you want to make the device. * 4 support bars, each long or however tall you want to make the device. * 4 exterior base bars, each long or half the length of a single top bar. * 4 interior base bars, each either the same length as the exterior base bars or half the distance between your shoulder blades. 3. Cut your pipes into multiple segments. Take a piece of PVC pipe and place it in a vise-grip or similar device, preventing the pipe from rolling away. Then, grab a handheld hacksaw or PVC ratchet cutter large enough to cut through pipes as thick as yours. Find the marked area and, when you’re ready, carefully cut through the pipe.	.

First Cube Section: Jump over the first two spikes. When you get to the ""stairs"", just jump on all of them (the last one doesn't matter). Jump over the first two spikes, then once you get to where there are blocks, just jump onto them. At about 14% there will be a staircase, just keep jumping. Next is a part that looks a little confusing at first, but you can jump-drop-jump-drop or just jump four times. Then, you have to drop under the next platform, and jump out of the hole so that you don't smack the wall. Then, after a few more jumps, you will find third staircase, similar to the second one in style. However, for the last block you have to drop to avoid a spike. 2. First Ship Section: To use the ship, you tap/press/click to go upward, and release to go downward. Going up or down gives you upward/downward momentum. If you can mostly stay in the middle, you are pretty much good to go. There is a part where you will have to drop down a bit, then there is a staircase looking thing going upward. You have to fly up a bit to avoid this one. Then, you have to not smack into the wall at the end. 3. Second Cube Section: You will have to jump over a spike, then there will be a staircase. If you jump three times, then drop twice, or jump twice, drop, and jump, then you will get a secret coin. Secret coins unlock icons, colors, and even two levels. Next, there is a longer staircase. Jump all the way up, then there will be a downward staircase type thing with gaps that you have to jump over. Once the background turns red, things get a little trickier. You have to jump twice to get on to a platform, drop, jump twice, drop and immediately jump. Then there will be a two spike jump, and a three spike jump. The three spike jump will require a great deal of precision, try to jump as late as possible without dying on the spike."	Once you jump up all the way, there will be blocks above and below the next area. if you jump onto the top blocks, you will get a secret coin. Be careful, on the last of those blocks (below the secret coin), there is a spike you have to jump over. Otherwise, you can just drop. Then, there will be a part that may look confusing, but you just have to jump three times. Then, a part where you drop twice, then another three spike jump. Then, you'll jump three times, drop twice, and jump twice, wait a tiny bit, then jump until you get to the purple/pink portal. In the final ship zone, you go between two obstacles, go above one, go below one, and go between three more. If you want to get the secret coin, you fly straight up right before the second obstacle, and there will be a hidden path in the top part of the obstacle. Then, you have to go through a complicated and difficult sequence to get the final secret coin.

Move every 60-90 minutes. There are a variety of side effects associated with sitting too long—anything from weight gain and back problems to loss of muscle mass and softening of your bones. To prevent these health conditions, move around every hour. Don't let yourself get caught too long at your desk without moving. * Set a timer on your phone or computer to help remind you to move. * Drink lots and lots of water. The more water you drink, the more often you'll be up using the restroom. * Give yourself a goal to get up and move at least 5-8 times a day and keep track of your progress each week. 2. Count your steps. Pedometers and fitness bands are a popular ways to monitor how much you step and move throughout the day. Aiming for at least 10,000 steps or about five miles a day may help you lose or maintain your weight and help keep you in shape. * Find ways to walk more throughout your day. For example, take the stairs instead of the elevator, park farther away, get up to deliver a message instead of emailing it or walk to a bathroom further away from your desk. * Download a free app on your phone, purchase an affordable pedometer or indulge with a fitness watch or band for a fun way to track your daily steps. * 10,000 steps should be your ultimate goal each day. If you're not there yet, creep up on the ultimate goal by setting mini-goals over time. For example, increase your steps by 200, 500, or 1,000 each day until you have met and surpassed the ultimate goal on an ongoing basis. 3. Take an exercise break. You don't need a gym or running shoes to put a little exercise in your day. Try chair exercises and other small exercises you can do comfortably at your desk. Spend 10-15 minutes on your lunch break doing doing these activities to help break the routine of sitting habit and limit the unhealthy effects of sitting so long. There are many sites online that offer ideas for exercising in your chair. Do a quick online search for some good ideas. * Review your schedule the day before and see if you can fit in just a few minutes of exercise - 10 minutes before a meeting or a 20 minutes during some down time. Schedule it so you remember! * De-stress after a long meeting with a quick yoga routine. It requires little to no equipment and you won't need to worry about getting too sweaty. * Try standing as you type or send emails. Standing is better for your posture and helps engage more muscle groups than sitting. 4. Add light cardio to your day. Take a few minutes daily to increase your heart rate and raise your breathing to a faster pace. Quick cardio moves can help burn calories through your day. In addition, these little sessions can help bring you out of an afternoon slump! * Take walks at lunchtime or before or after work. Get out and walk around the building, or the block. Get some natural sunlight if weather permits. If the weather is crummy, visit the nearest stairwell for a workout. * Run in place at your desk or do a few knee raises or jumping jacks to get your heart rate up. * Swap out your desk for a standing or treadmill desk to keep you moving while you work.	.

Understand what white balance is and how it affects your digital camera's picture? * White balance allows you to adjust the color of the picture. Instead of using different films for shooting under different light; bright light, sunny light, cloudy light, indoor light. On a digital camera there is a setting - white balance. * White balance is generally set to automatic on the camera. You can also set it manually for: 2. tungsten light, fluorescent light; sun light, cloudy light, flash light and thereby adjust the color to get the color of the picture exactly the way that you wanted. 3. What can I do if I shoot a digital picture on the wrong white balance setting? 4. Well, my real answer to you is make sure you've got it set right, because you're in a world of hurt if you're not.	You can try tungsten white balance for shooting indoors under tungsten light, or fluorescent white balance for shooting indoors under fluorescent light. Make sure, though, that you always check your white balance when you set manually, to make sure you're onto the right setting. If you make a mistake, you can, in Photoshop, adjust; but I'll tell you, I have a hard time adjusting to get the color looking right. So, bottom line, shoot auto unless you're comfortable manually setting the white balance.

Have a valid reason for breeding Syrian hamsters. You should have a clear plan in place about what you are going to do with all these babies. As well, ensure you have enough space, money and resources to house them all yourself, in case your breeding plans do not go as planned. Some options include: * Keeping them as pets. * Selling them as pets (though it is unlikely to provide you with much income). * Giving them away to good homes. 2. Consider your will execute your plan. You might think ""I'll just give them away to good homes"", but that is likely going to be harder than it sounds. Research the market before you begin breeding or you may end up with more hamsters than you have customers. * How will you advertise your hamsters? Good places to start include online, in the newspaper classified ads, and at the pet store (be sure to ask permission first). 3. Avoid breeding closely related hamsters. If you already own some hamsters from the same family, you do not want to breed them with each other. When you allow brothers to mate with sisters, or fathers/daughters or mothers/sons, you create an inbred line of hamsters. Inbred lines can suffer from genetic flaws. For healthy hamsters, avoid inbreeding altogether. 4. Purchase an unrelated male and female hamster. If the hamsters you have are all related, or if you do not yet have any, talk to several hamster breeders about where they get their stock. You only need one male and one female to get started. It is best to purchase them from different suppliers, to ensure the two breeding animals are not closely related. It is can be a poor idea to buy breeding hamsters from chain pet stores. Some pet stores can treat their hamsters quite poorly."	Baby hamsters, if chosen from a commercial pet store, are likely to suffer from mental, physical and even fatal deformities. Also, the hamster very often have poor temperament, and have a poor coloring.

Have respect for yourself. As a woman, you need to have self respect (and lots of it). This can be in many forms, but one of the most telling forms is how you dress. A man will care nothing of what you have to say or are interested in if he is too distracted by your cleavage or how tight your jeans are. There is subtle and sexy, and then there is blatant and trampy. Understand that men are constantly drawn towards sexual images of women on tv, magazines, posters, mall windows and the likes on a daily basis. If you really want to be heard-make an effort to appear attractive and put together but don't wear clothes that suggest you are ready to get out of them at a moment's notice. 2. Be competitive. Men are usually hard workers and enjoy healthy competition amongst themselves; anyone they can share that aspect with is a plus. If you enjoy a hobby that is physically demanding such as rock climbing, swimming, basketball, running or biking-share it with him. This is not to be mistaken with picking up a man, although attraction may naturally occur over time and certainly maybe a usable technique, we are talking about being taken seriously amongst friends, co-workers, and casual acquaintances. Be sure when you participate in the activity that you bring your A-game and put forth your best effort. Even if you aren't a pro at any sport or hobby, by being open to new challenges and giving something your best effort; men will respect you for it. Finding your balance by trying methods that work and don't work will ensure you get more comfortable with yourself and therefore, with other men. This can apply to work, school, hobbies, social gatherings, and the like. 3. Be motivated and confident. Apart from enjoying friendly competition, a woman must demonstrate motivation for her life. If you walk around with your head hung low, a frown on your face and complain constantly, no man will take you seriously except for taking you seriously about being unhappy. Again, if you enjoy a hobby-talk about it and share it at an appropriate time. Have children? Discuss their latest successes in school with a smile and comment on how proud you are of them. Discuss any new business ideas you might have, or creative thoughts if they appear interested. Working on a new art piece? Writing a poem? Finishing a degree? Taking a new yoga class? If you smile, laugh and speak with enthusiasm about what you have going on in your life---men will see that you are motivated and confident and take you seriously. Keep in mind this can depend on how long you keep up with a task. If you are constantly changing college degrees, change your core hobbies like changing socks and are indecisive with what you want from your life-that may leave doubt in many people's minds...not just men. 4. Make sure your ambitions are your own. Apart from having self respect, confidence, motivation and being competitive; you need to ask yourself for each aspect of your life, ""Why am I doing this?"" If you are doing stuff to simply impress a man, or men in general-you are doing it for the wrong reasons. In the same light, trust your instincts; only you can make decisions about your life and where you are heading. Not anyone else. 5. Be intelligent and well spoken. While all the above steps can fit into anyone's life, one of the key factors in success with being taken seriously by men, is being intelligent and well spoken. How you speak goes with how you carry yourself (self respect and confidence). Appropriate grammar and tone, as well as how frequently you speak can make or break success in the workplace, amongst new acquaintances and in recreational activities. Although all women have different sounding voices (high, low, soft, etc.), it is important to remember that you are judged by your pitch, how much emphasis you put on words, and your laugh. Record yourself to improve how you present yourself to other people. If you let your voice trail off at the end of a sentence, you could be setting yourself back in terms of getting a job you want or an important message across. It is important to practice your body language in addition to your speaking. On the same note, how you say something requires that you have something important or interesting to say. There are many ways to be ""intelligent"" but for the most part-pursuing higher education is usually a good place to start...in addition to watching educational programs, reading books, and keeping up on the latest news."	A woman who is well informed on various topics will have a better chance of being taken seriously by men (and other women) than the woman who only can discuss what kind of latest perfume a celebrity is coming out with.

Let go of your ego. A real hero knows that their actions might go unnoticed and that’s okay. Make sure you are trying to be a hero for the right reasons. You’ll need to be willing to help people who might not even know you have intervened in their lives. You’ll have to be focused more on the feeling you get from doing the good deed than the praise. center * Find the joy in seeing the smiles on other people’s faces. * Think about how you would feel having a good deed done for you. That will help you connect to the joy or change you’ve created in another person’s life. 2. Be the change you want to see. A true hero isn’t all talk. They are constantly thinking about how they can take action and help. You may be inspired to be a hero for a certain cause or issue, or you may try to be a hero to someone in need. center * For example, if you are passionate about the environment, don’t just preach to people that they should recycle. Try to start an environmental club at your school or get your friends together to help you build a compost bin in your backyard. * Maybe you are passionate about helping the homeless in your area. Rather than giving one homeless person money, you may get involved at your local homeless shelter and hand out food and basic supplies to the homeless in your area instead. 3. Put others before yourself. Think about what other people might need before you consider your own needs. When you are making decisions at work or at home, take some time to think about how your actions will affect someone else. If you take the day off of work, what kind of workload will that put on your coworkers?center * Remember that people think differently. What seems comfortable or easy for you might not seem that way to other people. You might feel really confident going to a karaoke night with a bunch of strangers, but your friend or date might not. Consider what other’s want in addition to what makes you happy. 4. Be ready to act when others are passive. People lead busy lives. Often a typical person is so focused on themselves, they don’t notice or care to act when something is wrong.	center

Customize your brush (either a pencil tool or a brush tool) by going to Options palette. There you can pick the size of your brush from the different size options. You can use the default brush if you are just starting out and then start customizing the size when you need variations. 2. Choose ""Hard Edge"" or ""Soft Edge"" when customizing your brush size. 3. Create your own brush by choosing ""New Brush"" from the Brush Options menu in the Options palette. You can choose either one, then define the size and parameters (hardness, diameter, spacing and angles) to create your custom brush. 4. Customize your brush mode. When you go to the Brushes palette for either the pencil or brush tool, you will find in each a pop-up menu of varying brush modes. These modes are used to modify how a tool will integrate with existing color on the canvas. 5. Choose any of the different modes on the menu. Bear in mind that when you draw something using Photoshop, the software will modify the existing pixels in the background similar to how it works when you are painting. For example, if you paint a streak of red over a blue background, it will be modified to a purple color. Brush modes are important in modifying the way you blend colors and how they interact. 6. Choose the Normal mode to apply a full blend value. When using the Painting tool, the base color will be coated completely by the blend color. When the Edit tool is used, the existing color is overridden by the edit value. 7. Use the Threshold mode to ensure that the color value of the tool is applied according to the closest available color in the color map. 8. Use the Dissolve mode to randomly scatter the blend color, giving it a rough texture and non-anti-aliased brush stroke. 9. Choose the Behind and Clear modes to modify the foreground and background colors. These two modes are available in layered images."	.

Decide whether you want a hardside or softside waterbed. A hardside waterbed is a soft bladder supported by wooden frames. A softside waterbed looks just like a regular mattress, but is supported by invisible foam frames concealed in the bedding. Both have equal benefits and work well. 2. Visit your local furniture shop. If you've decided on hardside, look around for hardside frames. Ask around and locate a waterbed specialist. They'll be priceless in your pursuit for a good waterbed. If you've decided on softside, look around for a sturdy frame of any sort.	.

First off, clarify your motives. To become a caterer, you need to love cooking. Do people admire your cooking? If so, catering is the career for you. 2. Secondly, it's a tough role. You need to be determined. You need to be ready to work night and day to make it work. A caterer must always be marketing their service, looking for the next job. Plus, you have to command many different people - wait staff, cooks, drivers and cleaners. 3. You must be able to handle the pressure - when staff fail to show up, when the client is unreasonable, and when the food is ruined - you must be ready with a plan to save the day, 4. Next, what role do you want to play? 5. Do you want to: 6. Become an employee? If so, apply for jobs in catering, hotels or the leisure industry. Or go to college, and get a qualification. Then apply for jobs. 7. Work for yourself? Buy a book on the subject, or go on a course. 8.	The two types of catering are completely different.

The items required are pretty hard to come by so check out uesp.net and look up reflect damage and they will help a lot. * For duplicating for money a fighting chance is ideal because it has a small confined space which will collect things quite nicely and if you go there the shopkeeper will follow you because she has to see you at all times. This is good because you can still sell to her when over-encumbered without moving make sure that you can in the location you will be duping first) also she is a master of mercantile so she has the most gold available for one sale possible(2000) and she buys weapons which are great to dupe and sell. also get enough money to buy her hammer of death or something like that and dupe and sell that. (sells for 2000) you will have to sell these one at a time and using lb on xbox will bring the amount to one which helps you sell more quickly. * You can make a suit enchanted with 100% chameleon using custom enchantments or sigil stones and pretty much do anything without being seen at all. * Visit uesp.net to know ANYTHING about oblivion. * To make permanent bound items cast the spell and fix the item past 100%(must be at least an expert of armorer) and drop the item. wait until the spell wears off and pick up the item. There are a lot of other ways to get permanent bound items too. * To do the Wizards tower glitch for xbox described above just go in the wizards tower in the alchemy garden, and save. (have a back up save just in case) then go delete the wizards tower add-on(you can re-download it for free) and load your save. you will be in blackness but you will see a house. Walk towards it while attacking and you will teleport in it after like 10 seconds. leave the house and on the ground by the fire by a rock there is the mace of doom which has a great fire spell and a truckload of charge and it ups you blade skill contrary to being a mace. There is another house which takes you to a creepy unlit Sigillum sanctus (the top of the main towers in oblivion gates) Cast a light spell and go to the top. Jump out to get the sigil stone and survive the drop. You will begin getting ridiculous amounts of sigil stone and they will keep coming until you leave so it is recommended to store a lot of you things somewhere safe (like in one of your houses) and maybe make a feather suit out of chainmail or permanent bound items(which weigh nothing and have daedric value) This will help so that you can carry a lot of sigil stones because you don't want to get over-encumbered in there because you will never get out and they will keep piling on faster than you can do anything.	so empty out that before you do this. And just fast travel anywhere to leave this place.

For example, do thorough research before starting, to ensure you're not putting more of the same on the market. If you want to do something generic, think hard about what makes your offerings better or different from existing ones.	Second, hard work is essential, along with dedication.

First of all, the timeframe will probably be 6 moths, give or take a couple of months – usually more, not less, if you’re starting completely from scratch. Ask your builder for their estimate, specific to your circumstances. It may or may not be obvious to you when you start along this process that there is a LOT of uncertainty involved in having your new home built. In the following paragraphs I’ll cover the major uncertainties that come to mind. First of all, unless you’re going to build a home with no options or upgrades, you don’t know the final price of the home that you’ll build until you are well on your way and pretty committed to the process. You will be required to put a deposit on the home pretty early on, and if you back out of the deal, you will forfeit that deposit, in most cases. So, will you build a home with no options and upgrades? Not likely. You’ll almost certainly want to customize the home to your tastes, and that usually means additional costs. Some of these costs can be estimated up front – some can’t. You’ll think of additional things you want, like modified or upgraded floor covering or counter tops along the way. These items can add up quick and can be unpredictable, at least in my experience. But, estimate a price and then be prepared to see that price go higher as you move through the process and discover all the options and upgrades that you’ll want. The homebuilder will give you an estimate of how long it will take to complete your home, but they can’t be sure exactly how long it will take and neither can you. The construction schedule will depend to some extent on weather, the availability of tradesmen, and the options and modifications that you may choose.	You certainly can’t count on an exact completion date when you start the roughly 6-month or longer process of building a home. Another uncertainty is that you probably won’t know the interest rate on your mortgage until close to the completion of construction! Interest rates are almost never locked in for the length of time it will take to build your new home. If you do choose to lock your interest rate in well in advance of your new home’s completion, you will pay a price for that certainty. But, you’ll more likely lock your interest rate in within a month or less of your home’s completion. That means that interest rates could go down – if you’re lucky – or up, by a fair amount between the time you commit to the process of building a home and the time you lock in your rate. And the last uncertainty I’ll mention is economical. You don’t know how the economy will change in the time it takes to build your home. Most important, how will your personal economy change? If you count on a job for income, will you still have one when the home is completed? You probably will, but most people couldn’t realistically say “yes” for sure. There’s some uncertainty there, and it’s a big – no, a HUGE factor. If you or your spouse were to lose your jobs, could you still qualify for the mortgage? If the answer is no, then my advice is to be extra valuable at work, to reduce this uncertainty as much as possible.

Place these ingredients in the blender. 3. Prepare the yogurt.Now the next thing that goes in is the natural yogurt. That's going to give the smoothie a wonderful body and it's also nice and healthy. Go for a low fat yogurt. Add it directly to the blender. 4. Prepare the orange juice which will thin smoothie and the banana which will thicken it up. Now if you prefer a thicker one, just add more banana. If you are looking for a thinner add a nice little bit of orange juice. 5. Peel the banana and using a small knife, in it goes to the blender. 6. Blend the ingredients.Put the lid on it, mix it for 30 seconds and there is your perfect, quick breakfast. So that's been blend for literally 30 second and its ready to be served. 7. Give it a last kick with lime. Look at that beautiful bright vivacious color , it's lovely and smooth.	So just give it a quick roll on your chopping board to losing up those juices. Cut it in half and then give it lovely squeeze o on the top . That will give it a really nice punchy flavor and also add even more Vitamin C and antioxidants.

This will allow you to make a bracelet that is long enough to wrap around your wrist.	Remember, it’s better to cut the string too long rather than too short.

Buy_a_Video_Card_For_Your_PC.txt	Inside_Revision	0.401	## Steps	130	But for the most part NVidia is an excellent choice , with solid drivers and good support .	## Steps	716	For the most part NVidia is an excellent choice , with solid drivers and good support .	<delete><But><1>|||<replace><for><2><For><1>	True	Steps  1. Decide what you want and need to do with the video card. Video cards range broadly in price from as much as $550 for the latest and greatest to $30 for an entry-level card. To choose the right one, you need to know how you want to use it. Do you want to play all the very latest games at maximum resolution and full visual effects? If so, you will need to purchase a high-end card, usually $250 or higher. If you just need to display your PC screen on two monitors or drive a high-end DVI monitor or TV, you can purchase a lower-end card. 2. Know what type of slot you will be using. Video cards can plug into three different types of slots on your mother-board. In order of highest performance, the slot types are PCI Express, AGP, or PCI at the low end. If your PC is more than 2 years old, it may only have a PCI slot. Most PCs today have AGP slots. AGP cards are usually $10-$20 dollars cheaper than PCI equivalents and perform 2-4 times faster. If you bought your PC recently it may have the newer, faster PCI Express slot. 3. Choose a chip brand, either ATI or NVidia. They are the two leading companies that make the graphics chips that go into video cards. For many years, NVidia was the leader in this space. In the past two years, ATI chips and drivers have caught up with NVidia in terms of performance for the price.	You can find reviews and descriptions of the leading chips and video cards available in all the major PC magazines online and in print. You can also go to manufacturer's web sites such as the one for Diamond Multimedia for more information on the available video cards.

Buying AMD or Nvidia? * Would you believe that this question just doesn't matter that much? Like ""AMD or Intel?"", ""Windows or Mac?"", and ""Desktop or laptop?"", it's a question that inspires intense—and often nonsensical—debate among each side's adherents. We're not going to lie to you: There are substantial differences in the technologies in AMD's and Nvidia's graphics chipsets, and if you're really picky, you may have a very good reason for choosing one over the other. * The truth, however, is that only serious, detail-obsessed gamers are going to be able to discern a difference in appearance between a game running on an AMD card and one running on a comparable product from Nvidia. Most people are going to pay more attention to how realistic a game looks and whether it stutters during play than the specific types of anti-aliasing, physics processing, and multimonitor technologies that are employed.

Buying AMD or Nvidia? * Would you believe that this question just doesn't matter that much? Like ""AMD or Intel?"", ""Windows or Mac?"", and ""Desktop or laptop?"", it's a question that inspires intense—and often nonsensical—debate among each side's adherents. We're not going to lie to you: There are substantial differences in the technologies in AMD's and Nvidia's graphics chipsets, and if you're really picky, you may have a very good reason for choosing one over the other. * The truth, however, is that only serious, detail-obsessed gamers are going to be able to discern a difference in appearance between a game running on an AMD card and one running on a comparable product from Nvidia. Most people are going to pay more attention to how realistic a game looks and whether it stutters during play than the specific types of anti-aliasing, physics processing, and multimonitor technologies that are employed. If you find a card at a price you can afford, and reviews say it does well, go with it. Most of the other stuff is just gravy—and often lumpy at that. 2. Choose a GPU * A video card's graphics processing unit (GPU) is what determines its video capabilities, and many GPUs have names that are often fairly arcane and unintuitive if you don't follow the business closely. But a good rule of thumb is that the higher the number in the GPU's name, the more recent and more powerful it is. 3. Know Memory and Clock Speed * Ultimately, video cards aren't much different from CPUs—a lot of the same rules apply, including those about memory and clock speed. Video cards have their own collections of both, although the specific values of either will usually be less immediately important than when you're choosing a system processor. It's possible for two video cards of the same type to have different amounts of memory, Nvidia's GPU, maybe available in both 1.5GB and 3GB of memory—and the one with more memory will tend to be faster and cost more. Likewise, some cards might use GDDR5 memory, which is faster and more expensive than the GDDR3 memory other cards use. Lower-end video cards sometimes have faster clock speeds to compensate for the power they lack in other areas, but that's usually not going to translate to increased real-world performance. You only need to pay close attention to these specs if you want to fine-tune your purchase; in most cases, the name of the GPU will tell you everything you need to know about the card's capabilities. 4. Look at Length, Height and Width * Back when all computers were two-foot-tall towers, no one thought much about video cards hogging a lot of space."	The more powerful a card, the longer it's going to be, and the less likely it will fit into a microATX case, or even a smaller ATX case. Some higher-end AMD and Nvidia cards will be longest of cards you ever saw. If you're building a smaller computer, or you want to upgrade the video in a minitower you already have, be aware that your card choices may be limited.

Confirm what type of bankruptcy you have filed for. Before you apply for car financing, know whether you have filed for Chapter 13 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy. If you file for bankruptcy as an LLC or a business, then your bankruptcy falls under Chapter 11, which carries a different set of rules for asset seizure and debt repayment. * If you have filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, your debts are typically eliminated, and the process usually takes three to four months. * Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves repaying your creditors through a Chapter 13 re-payment plan that typically lasts three to five years. The repayment plan involves paying a high portion of your monthly income towards debt repayment. Afterwards remaining debts are usually eliminated. 2. Know how your bankruptcy impacts your credit. Under both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy, your credit score will be badly damaged for some time to come. It can take up to 10 years to fully erase the impact of filing for bankruptcy (either Chapter 13 or 7). However, purchasing power through credit can usually be established after 3 years if the initial debt situation was not too drastic. 3. Understand the difference between exempt and non-exempt assets. Every bankruptcy case is different and varies in relation to an individual’s income, the particular amount owed to creditors, and the types of assets an individual holds. Under Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a reasonably priced vehicle that provides you with transportation to necessary destinations, like work, the doctor’s office, etc…, will usually not be seized to pay off your creditors. * However, if you purchased a luxury vehicle, you may be forced to sell that vehicle, purchase a more affordable vehicle, and use the remaining portion for debt repayment. So, before considering the purchase of a new vehicle, see what options are available to you through a debt consultant. 4. Examine whether you truly need a car. Unless you have sufficient cash to purchase a car, getting a car will mean acquiring new debt. While in bankruptcy, acquiring debt means facing potentially high interest rates (as high as 18%) and adding to your debt at a time when you are working to reduce it. Most importantly, you will need to prove to the court as well as your trustee that a car is necessary. * If there are alternative options to owning a car (using public transit, walking, carpooling), utilize these first. This could save you significant amount in interest costs, and help you return to financial stability quicker. 5. Wait if you can. Your credit improves as you move further into the bankruptcy process. While it can take 10 years to restore your credit fully, you may be able to negotiate better financing options 1 or 2 years into the bankruptcy process.	.

Pick a good location for your ""bonding"" sessions. Using a halter or neck strap that allows for as much free movement as possible so it isn't forced to be close to you. If your horse's paddock doesn't have many horses in it and your horse is not aggressive, you can also ""talk"" to your horse in a paddock. This is better, because it feels more free for the horse. You can also lead your horse around the paddock, letting him/her eat at times as well. 3. Begin with grooming your horse. Most horses love grooming, as it is relaxing. Grooming is also a great way to bond with your horse. Just pick up a rubber curry comb and massage your horse, they like this and he may try to rub on you to show affection, they do this in the wild. You should avoid grooming his face, because it ruins the relaxed mood."	Reach for your horse's hoof and attempt to pick it up, do this before anything else. If he gets mad, remove your hand and reassure him. He will soon understand that you will not force anything until he is ready. But keep trying, otherwise he will think he can get away with anything.

Know whom you are dealing with. Don't believe everything you hear from a salesperson representing a binary options broker. Instead, do your own research online. Look up that brokerage company and find basic information like physical address and name of the underlying company. Most scam brokers will conceal this information for reasons easily understood: if they plan to scam you, they don’t really want you to know where they are located or the real name of their company. Make sure they have physical headquarters, not just a virtual office or a rented P.O. box.center 2. Know if they're regulated or not. Make sure the broker you are dealing with is regulated by a major regulatory body. If a financial company is regulated, it has to abide by fair-practice rules and to have the best interests of its clients in mind when doing business.	What this means is that, in the event the broker goes bankrupt, your money is safe and sometimes even insured to some extent. A regulated broker is also constantly monitored by the regulatory authority so that a high level of professionalism is maintained. center

Care for your looks Looks count. It's all about how you present yourself, and if you want to present yourself in a good way then well grooming would do. Put some effort in your appearance. You don't have to be a rich supermodel to do this luckily. 2. Clear skin doesn't come easy for all Even if you have a huge pimple that you can't get rid of you should still walk tall. But to erase them, and prevent any more to erase them stick with a product you're using or invest in some acne products that include benzoyl peroxide, and/or salicylic acid. If you don't see improvement in your skin in a few days with your new product doesn't mean it's not working. It takes time to see improvment a month or less. Exfoliate when needed. When exfoliating you remove dean skin cells, which also helps pimples form. Do not exfoliate everyday which irritates you skin. Once it's removed skin looks, and feel fresh, and it glows. Follow up with a toner, and moisturizer. Everyone have different skin types so look for a formula made especially for your skin type. 3. A little makeup doesn't hurt Simplicity makes all the difference. Just two coats of mascara can enhance your eyes, make them pop, and lashes look long, and voluminous, but to actually get that you need some good quality mascara. I highly recommend going to Macy's, Sephora, Dillard's, to get your quality cosmetic needs. 4. Take care of your nails. Keep them neat.	To get those perfect nails use the real ones you have. Get a regular manicure every month or two. But for those perfectly manicure nails at home, which saves your time and your money, Buff your nails until they're shiny. Bath and Body Works have some great quality buffers, but you can get them nearly anywhere. Once your nails are shiny use a white nail pencil on the tips of your nails, but to get a smoother, cleaner, and easier finish moisten tips with water first! Select Sally Hansen, and OPI while they both have great quality nail products for less. For healthy nails add calcium, vitamin A, protein, vitamin b12, and to prevent those nasty hang nails folic acid, protein, and vitamin c will do, so find a way to slip those into your meals.

Follow labelled directions for a successful wash. If skin is irritated, red, or damaged after a day or a week of use with the product stop use immediately. But the best way to get clear skin is a healthy diet which allows plenty fruits, vegetables, and 8 ounces of water a day. A nice sleep also help improves skin texture, and clarity.

They'll thank you. Clear skin is a definite boost in confidence level, not only your face would glow, your personality would shine too! 3. Brows creates the face. Pluck away only stray hairs very other week. Plucking your brows everyday can irritate your skin. It's easy to lose shape when trying to pluck ""only"" stray hairs. You can be left browless, being tweezer happy. If it ever happens apply olive oil to help speed growth of brows. While brows grow back ask professions to pencil some for you. If you can't afford, or take time to go to the salon do them yourself with a brow pencil. Make sure the color is a bit lighter than your natrual hair color, and apply in light, feather-like strokes. To define your brows, use a light brown eyeshadow, a small short bristle eye brush, and some eyebrow gel. Next choose your eyebrow color. If you have light hair, use a light beige shade, for dark hair use a darker beige. But never use black! Trust me, I tried and it will look fake. Then fill in the brow with the short bristled eye brush in light strokes. Last set brows with eyebrow gel working the product from the inside of the brow into the outside. Your brows will look perfect! A good simple trick to define brows is to apply white eyeliner below your eyebrow, and blend in. If don't like makeup, know your limits, and use a small eyebrow comb, and brush brows up, and lastly use a small amount of vaseline to set brows, and tame them. 4. When buying cosmetics Always ask questions to yourself about the product. If you're buying foundation ask yourself ""does the shade match my skin tone?"" and ""Does this product benefits me?"" Trust me on this one, I've done the two-toned look, and it's not pretty. Consult a professional for help. I highly reccommend going to Sephora for quality cosmetic needs, and professional help. 5. Simplicity makes all the difference when it's coming to cosmetics. All little color never hurts. But no matter what never rush when you're applying your makeup. Take some time to work on each feature. This is a basic rule when you're working on perfecting make up. For Skin Skin should be clean, and moisturized before you put anything onto yourskin. Determine whether you need foundation or concealer. What spots do you need concealer on? Pat foundation and/or concealer. Never rub your foundation which can easily slide off your face. Blend the foundation or concealer in completely. Use foundation on your eyelids, and concealer under you eyes and anywhere on troubled spots. You can also use tinted moisturizers which gives you sheer, but great coverage, and light texture, safe, and sheer enough for summer! Use Clinique's concealers, and foundations which has the best quality, and variety. Use a powder to set foundation, and control too much shine on skin. Next apply cream blush, cheek stains. They give off a nice healthy flesh and a hint of shape in your facial structure. If you like powders use them. Any blush is fine. Tarte, Fresh, and Loreal gives you excellent quality, more varitey, and color. Smile and dust blush on the apples of your cheeks and blend with your fingers. For eyes apply a neutral shade from lashline to creases, and a coat of mascara. If you want drama add a little more color to your eyes, next apply eyeliner, then curl top, and bottom lashes, and apply two coats of lengthening, and thickening mascara. Mascara can enhance your eyes, make them pop, and lashes look long, and voluminous, but to actually get that you need some good quality mascara. I highly recommend DiorShow mascaras, so be sure to invest in some good ones. Also work on your brows. Bobbi Brown has the best eye makeup products, I highly reccomend. For Lips Use a soft lip color like Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer Balm. It's the best for sheer color, that you can build on. Be sure to apply them on conditioned lips. After you're done with all of these steps take a chance to look over your makeup. Maybe you need more blending. If so blend more. You could of course skip most of these steps depending on how you like your make up. You may not like foundation, you don't have to use it. Many say you're suffocating skin using too much makeup which maybe true, so don't use any. If you're young and don't like too much makeup on some of these tips can still be required. So know your limits when it's coming to make up. 6. Take care of your nails. Keep them neat, and never use acrylic nails. Though they maybe pretty for awhile, your real nails would get damaged due to toxic glues holding the nail together. To get those perfect nails use the real ones you have. Get a regular traditional manicure every month or two at a local, trusted salon. You can also get those perfectly manicure nails at home, which saves you time and money. Simply clean your nails before doing anything. Soak in warm water, and use a cuticle remover, then buff your nails until they're shiny. Bath and Body Works have some great quality nail buffers that'll last you, but you can get them nearly anywhere. Once your nails are shiny moisten the tips of your nails with water for an easier, cleaner, and smoother finish and apply white nail pencil on the tips of your nails. Select Sally Hansen, and OPI nail products, while they both have great quality nail products for less. To keep your healthy nails add calcium, vitamin A, protein, vitamin b12, folic acid, protein, and vitamin c will do, and prevent those nasty hangnails so find a way to slip those into your meals. 7. Taking care of the basics for your hair Take time for your hair. Wash your hair daily, and follow up with conditioning. When washing your hair with shampoo focus more on the roots. When conditioning focus more the on the ends of your hair. I recommend Dove, and Suave hair products. But you can use any trusted product. Use a special formula especially for your hair whether it's colored, or relaxed. The main important thing to keeping hair healthy and growing is to trim your ends. Get them trimmed regualry 3-8 weeks MAX. No matter how much you cut off your hair grows quicker, and the ends of your hair won't be brittle and thin. Don't use rubberbands for ponytails or any updos. The healthiest is scrunchies for your hair, or metal less elastics. Be sure to add protein to keep hair shiny and strong. 8. Straightening your hair is basically destroying your hair not really if you use a heat protectant for your mane. When you apply a heat protectant on your hair when straightening (or when using any other thermal tool) it's easier, comes out smoother, and shinier, and is easier to tame. To get that pin straight hair look apply straigtening balm while hair is still wet. Allow hair to dry completely so there would be no frizzies. Brush moisturized hair while blowing drying. After hair dries creating sections in your hair, then flat iron big sections going from root to end. Use a T3 Tourmaline straightner. This products provides great shine, and long lasting straightening. The product has better quality than any other brand I've used, but also has a 24 month warranty. I highly reccommend this product! 9. Coloring your hair is very simple nowadays. But maintaing the color, and taking care of the health of your hair can be tricky. Choose a shampoo, and conditioner especially formulated for color treated hair obviously. Use TRUSTED products to keep the color top notch. If you're new to coloring your hair and you don't really know what would look good on your hair, or you just want to experiment, try using Herbal Essences Colorflirt Mousse Hair Color. The results of the color is subtle, and it's very easy. But if you ever decide to color your hair the simplest way to do this is going to your hairstylist. It may cost but the results, and the products they use it top notch and does 5 times better, and healthier than at home treatments. Your hairstylist may also give you reccomendations. They're professionals they know what looks good and what doesn't. 10. Make hair smell amazing by buying nice smelling shampoo that benefits hair. Buy what suits your hair needs, and a scent that pleases you. A great tip to keep hair smelling fresh is to use lemon juice on your hair after you shampoo, before you condition. For more frangrace apply a few mists of your favorite purfume onto your locks which lasts longer, and is more noticable. 11. Be sure to brush your teeth it's a must to do. Brush them 2-3 times a day with whitening paste to keep them white, and healthy and follow up with flossing, and mouthwash. Then after those meals pop in some gum. Use Orbitz whitening gum, and/or Trident White. If you have stained teeth I consider Crest WhiteStripes Premimum Plus. They're the cheapest and the results are great. You have plenty more options when bleaching your teeth like using trays (which they're more expensive), and/or going to a professional. After beaching your teeth you must sacrifice a few things to keep them pearly white. Your enamel is removed (which is why your teeth are so bright), but it's more prone to stains. Sacrifice colorful pastes, and trade in for some white paste for an entire week, Eat white foods like rice, milk, and chicken, use clear alcohol-free mouthwash, and to maintain color chew some whitening gum after every meal. And if you have crooked teeth consider getting some retainers. A smile is a welcoming, yet simple way to attract people to you. 12. Being fit is very hard for most of us but you don't need to to give up the foods you love just to be fit and healthy. Eat when your hungry, stop when you're full. It's as simple as that. But this doesn't mean you could eat up all the junk you can. You must add the needed nutrients and vitamins in your meal. Take vitamins before your meal. A much known rule to staying fit is to eat a full healthy breakfast. Just cereal wouldn't do the trick. Add banana's, orange juice, wheat bread with peanut butter into that and that's a simple meal. To be actively healthy take a nice walk around the park which is relaxing, just as they are excerising. Walking around the mall is another great alternative. Go to the gym. You must have a motivation and stick to it no matter how hard it maybe. If you want to go to the gym which memberships can get pretty pricey check out some deals. If you're young and in school join a sport, even if you're not good at it they always say practice makes perfect. Do sports like soccer, lacrosse, basketball, and cheerleading. There's no excuse to not be into sports. We're young! You build stamina starting slow, and moving your way on up. But you have to push yourself to work. When you get tired take a break, then do it again the time you've got. 13. Buy pretty work out clothes Who said you can't look pretty in the gym? Well certainly you can. Wear patterns, and wear leggings under your shorts, or under a long tunic. As long as you can move in the clothes when working out do so. Carry cute work out bags with your outfit. 14. Improve your posture walking with your head held high, and your shoulders back is a great way to show that you're confident. Body movement speaks volumes. Slouching on the other hand isn't pretty. Practice sitting on your computer desk. 15. Yummy purfume can make you feel fabulous Have you noticed you instantly feel confident applying the purfume you love? Wash your hair with your favorite scented shampoo, and take a shower (twice a day) with your favorite smelling body wash, and soft scented baby oil that doesn't over powers the sweet scents. Lavendar scented Johnsons Baby Oil is a great one."	Not everyone likes the same smell of purfume so you have to test them out for yourself. When shopping for some take some testers and spray in the air and wait for a few seconds to let the scent get in as though it always starts off strong, and becomes softer. If you like the smell BUY IT! When applying purfume to yourself apply behind clean ears which is more noticable.

Care for your looks. Looks count. It's all about how you present yourself, and if you want to present yourself in a good way then put some effort into your appearance. You don't have to be a rich supermodel to do this, luckily. 2. Have good hygiene. The basic steps are showering at least once a day. Use moisturizing soap for extra soft and smooth skin. If you bathe, a good tip is to add a cap full of baby oil into the tub for smooth, glowing, moisturized skin all day long. There are many hygiene rules that are easy to forget, like making sure to clean behind your ears! Always do so when or after washing your face. 3. Be sure to brush your teeth it's a must to do. Brush them 2-3 times a day with whitening paste to keep them white, and healthy and follow up with flossing, and mouthwash.	Use Orbitz whitening gum, and/or Trident White. If you have stained teeth consider Crest WhiteStripes Premium Plus. They're the cheapest and the results are great. You have plenty more options when bleaching your teeth like using trays (which they're more expensive), and/or going to a professional, which is even more expensive. But the results are worth it. After bleaching your teeth, you must sacrifice a few things to keep them pearly white. Your enamel is removed so your teeth are brighter, but it's more prone to stains. Sacrifice colorful pastes, and trade in for some white paste for an entire week. Eat white foods like rice, milk, and chicken, use clear alcohol-free mouthwash, and to maintain color, chew some whitening gum after every meal.

Always ask questions to yourself about the products you are buying. If you're buying foundation, ask yourself ""does the shade match my skin tone?"" and ""Does this product benefits me?"" The two-toned look isn't pretty. Consult a professional for help. 2. Keep it simple. A little color never hurts. But no matter what, never rush when you're applying your makeup. Take some time to work on each feature. This is a basic rule when you're working on perfecting makeup. * Skin should be clean and moisturized before you put anything onto your skin. Determine whether you need foundation or concealer. What spots do you need concealer on? Pat foundation and/or concealer. Never rub your foundation which can easily slide off your face. Blend the foundation or concealer in completely. Use foundation on your eyelids, and concealer under your eyes and anywhere on troubled spots. You can also use tinted moisturizers which gives you sheer, but great coverage, and light texture, safe, and sheer enough for summer! Use Clinique's concealers, and foundations which has the best quality, and variety. Use a powder to set foundation, and control too much shine on skin. Next apply cream blush, cheek stains. They give off a nice healthy flesh and a hint of shape in your facial structure. If you like powders, use them. Any blush is fine. Tarte, Fresh, and Loreal gives you excellent quality, more variety, and color. Smile and dust blush on the apples of your cheeks and blend with your fingers. *For eyes, apply a neutral shade from lash line to creases, and a coat of mascara. For a dramatic look for eyes don't be afraid to use a bit of color. The color has to be worn well though. It's not easy pulling off a color like hot pink on your eyelids. If you want a funkier approach know you're limits. What would look good against your complexion, what would look good with your outfit. You can be subtle. If you want apply eyeliner, and trace along your lash line, whether you want it from the bottom, or top. Curl top, and bottom lashes, and apply two coats of lengthening, and thickening mascara. Mascara can enhance your eyes, make them pop, and lashes look long, and voluminous, but to actually get that you need some good quality mascara. DiorShow mascaras are recommend, so be sure to invest in some good ones. Bobbi Brown has the best eye makeup products, highly recommended. ' * Keep lips soft and smooth always. Use a soft lip color like Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer Balm. It's the best for sheer color, that you can build on. Be sure to apply them on conditioned lips. After you're done with all of these steps take a chance to look over your makeup. Maybe you need more blending. If so blend more. You could of course skip most of these steps depending on how you like your make up. You may not like foundation, you don't have to use it. Many say you're suffocating skin using too much makeup which maybe true, so don't use any. If you're young and don't like too much makeup on some of these tips can still be required. So know your limits when it's coming to make up. 3. Take care of your nails. Keep them neat, and never use acrylic nails. Though they maybe pretty for awhile, your real nails would get damaged due to toxic glues holding the nail together. To get those perfect nails use the real ones you have. Get a regular traditional manicure every month or two at a local, trusted salon. But you can also get those perfectly manicure nails at home, which saves you time and money. Simply clean your nails before doing anything. Soak in warm water, and use a cuticle remover, then buff your nails until they're shiny. Bath and Body Works have some great quality nail buffers that'll last you, but you can get them nearly anywhere. Once your nails are shiny moisten the tips of your nails with water for an easier, cleaner, and smoother finish and apply white nail pencil on the tips of your nails. Select Sally Hansen, and OPI nail products, while they both have great quality nail products for less. To keep your healthy nails add calcium, vitamin A, protein, vitamin b12, folic acid, protein, and vitamin c will do, and prevent those nasty hangnails so find a way to slip those into your meals. 4. Take time for your hair. Wash your hair daily, and follow up with conditioning. When washing your hair with shampoo focus more on the roots. When conditioning focus more the on the ends of your hair. Dove, and Suave hair products work well and are inexpensive."	Use a special formula especially for your hair whether it's colored, or relaxed. The main important thing to keeping hair healthy and growing is to trim your ends. Get them trimmed regularly 3-8 weeks MAX. No matter how much you cut off your hair grows quicker, and the ends of your hair won't be brittle and thin. Don't use rubber bands for ponytails or any updos. The healthiest is scrunchies for your hair, or metal less elastics. Be sure to add protein to keep hair shiny and strong.
Choose_a_Healthy_Breakfast_Cereal.txt	Begin_Revision	0.969	## Steps	1689	Then try adding chopped nuts , fresh or dried ( unsweetened ) fruits , spices or flavor extracts , seeds , lemon juice , honey , and other fresh ingredients to taste .	### Finding Healthy Options	1766	Try adding chopped nuts , fresh or dried ( unsweetened ) fruits , spices or flavor extracts , seeds , lemon juice , honey , and other fresh ingredients to taste .	<delete><Then><1>|||<replace><try><2><Try><1>	True	Steps  1. Avoid breakfast cereals with “frosted,” “sweetened,” “sugary,” or “fruity” in the name. These cereals will all contain extra empty calories from sweeteners and flavorings. * Ingredient lists that mention fructose, dextrose, glucose, corn syrup, cane sugar, raw sugar, monosaccharide, molasses, honey, or other sweeteners mean the cereal has added sugar. * If an unsweetened cereal tastes too bland, try adding a half-teaspoon of sugar or honey at home instead of buying a sweetened breakfast cereal. This way, you can better manage the added sugar and slowly wean yourself off of it at your own pace. 2. Opt for cereals with 100% whole grains. Bran, oat, wheat, and granola breakfast cereals will typically have more whole grains, fiber, and other important ingredients than their over-processed counterparts. * Flakes, O’s, and cluster cereals are typically processed, but they may still contain whole grains and other important ingredients for a healthy cereal. When purchasing a cereal in this category, simply avoid those with added ingredients that often accompany processed cereals, such as simple sugars and artificial flavors. 3. Select a cereal fortified with additional vitamins and minerals and rich in fiber. Many healthy cereals will contain additional nutrients that can make them an important part of a morning routine for a healthy lifestyle. * Fortified cereals are especially useful for those who do not take a multi-vitamin or mineral supplement. * High fiber cereals can be especially important for individuals experiencing irregular bowel movements, high cholesterol, poor blood sugar regulation, or weight issues. 4. Opt for regular (unflavored) hot cereals like oatmeal or creamed wheat that are made of 100% whole grains. Whole grains, as opposed to enriched or refined grains, maintain all of their health benefits and fiber content. * If possible, buy oatmeal that is not quick-cook; some health authorities suggest quick-cook oats may contain fewer health benefits than their traditional alternative. If time is an issue, though, quick-cook oats still have many health benefits. 5. Select a breakfast cereal with no added preservatives, colors, or unnatural flavors. * The Food and Drug Administration maintains a list of food additives (found in the Sources section below) that can help identify unnatural ingredients in breakfast cereals. * Artificial ingredients typically contain no health benefits, and some research indicates that excessive amounts of certain preservatives and additives may be associated with health problems. 6. Look for cereals endorsed by health associations. The easiest way to do this is to look for the logos representing the American Heart Association or another nationally recognized nutrition or health association on the cereal packaging. * These endorsements indicate that the cereals meet certain minimum standards of quality or nutrition, and may be useful in helping you choose a breakfast cereal with at least minimum recommended levels of nutrition. 7. Consider breakfast cereals that are certified organic. * Many times, organic cereals have significant reductions or even total elimination of the added sugars included in their non-organic competitor cereals, as they are required to meet a minimum standard of naturally-produced ingredients. * Although some organic cereals may not be more nutritious than non-organic cereals, they may contain considerably less residue from pesticide, insecticide, or preservative usage. If consumption of these chemicals is a personal health concern, organic breakfast cereals may be worth the extra cost. 8. Watch out for hidden calorie or sugar sources. * Dried fruits are often sweetened with sugar, and “clusters” of oats, bran flakes, or nuts are frequently coated with sweetener as well. * Flavorings that imitate honey, cinnamon, fruit, or nut flavors may also be loaded with sugar and calories. * Flavored oatmeal or creamed cereals may have fruit, spice, or nut flavors that made up of sugar and artificial flavors. * Cereals with freeze-dried, unsweetened fruits may contain preservatives and artificial colors, but they also may contain significantly fewer added sugars than dried fruit chunks. 9. Add your own flavorings to unflavored breakfast cereal to reduce your intake of added preservatives and empty calories. * Add a handful of fresh or frozen berries, banana, or nuts to boost the nutritional value and the flavor of healthy breakfast cereals. Fruit, spices, and nuts can make a healthy breakfast cereal even better by adding vitamins, antioxidants, protein, and healthy fats. Even a teaspoon of honey can add nutrients and sweet flavor that is a healthier option than choosing pre-sweetened cereal from the store. * Try experimenting with fresh herbs like mint and basil, or real spices like cinnamon, cloves or nutmeg. You can also experiment with flavor extracts like pure vanilla or almond extract for added aroma. * Homemade muesli is another alternative to pre-flavored store-bought cereals that can contain excellent amounts of fiber, vitamins, healthy carbohydrates, antioxidants, and nutrients essential for a balanced and heart-healthy diet. Start with a base of rolled or whole oats, plain bran flakes, or other whole grain, soaking it in milk, plain yogurt, cream, water, or 100% fruit juice to soften them.	.

Decide what message you want your dress to send. Some colors convey symbolic meaning. If you want to subtly convey a message to your date, host, or somebody you know you’ll see at the event, color might be the way to do it. Some colors can even evoke physical responses in their viewers! * Red conveys emotional intensity and passion. It can suggest sexuality and lust, and is also very effective at grabbing attention. * Orange conveys enthusiasm and creativity. It is also visually stimulating and suggests heat. * Yellow conveys joy and energy and is the color of sunshine. It also draws attention. If you want people to see that you’re happy, yellow might be your ticket. But be careful not to overdo it; too much yellow can be overwhelming and might not be flattering on you. * Green conveys nature, growth, and fertility. It can make people feel safe and stable. It is also the color of money. * Blue is associated with calmness and loyalty. * Purple is historically associated with royalty, so wearing purple conveys power, wealth, and luxury. It is also associated with magic. * White is most often associated with purity. It conveys innocence and perfection—as long as you can keep it clean! Tip: Unless you’re the bride, don’t wear a white dress to a wedding. * Black conveys power and confidence. It’s hard to get more elegant than a black dress with a perfect fit. 2. Remember that not all colors are considered appropriate for all events. Make sure that you pay attention to any dress code information associated with the event you’re going to. Wearing a neon green mini-dress to a black tie event will get you some dirty looks—and may get you kicked out. * Dark colors tend to be standard for formal evening events, although if you want to stand out and draw attention wearing something bright will help you do that. * Prints and patterns are better for casual or daytime events. Generally, an evening gown should be made out of solid-colored fabric. Brighter, more vibrant colors are also more common at these events. * Neutral colors like black, white, gray, brown, and navy are appropriate for any event, though they won’t help you stand out if you want to. 3. Think about the theme of the event, if there is one. Themed events offer a great opportunity to have some fun with color.	If you’re going to a celestial-themed formal dance, consider wearing a metallic-colored gown—maybe even one with sequins!—which will remind people of the stars, moon, or sun.

Consider what your date is wearing, if you have one. While you’re not necessarily expected to match your date perfectly, some color-combinations can be cringe-worthy and should be avoided. If you’ll be spending the bulk of the night with one person, and especially if there will be photos, you might want to ask your date what he or she is wearing to make sure that you won’t clash with each other. * If one of you is wearing a neutral color like black, white, gray, brown, or navy, you’ll probably be fine. But keep in mind that some darker shades of blue and brown can look funky with black. * If both of you are wearing bright colors, you could get into trouble. Bright shades of red and purple, for example, can look hideous together.	.

Learn the color wheel. The color wheel is exactly what it sounds like: a big circle broken into different colors, which allows you to look at 12 colors at once. Each color on the wheel represents all shades of that color, so the green wedge on the color wheel represents dark, pale, and bright greens. Once you know the tricks of the color wheel, it can be super useful for figuring out which accessories in which colors will work best with the color of your dress. * Start out by picking the color on the wheel closest to the color of your dress. * The color across from your dress color is its complementary color. A pair of complementary colors is vibrant and high-contrast, especially if you use bright shades of the colors. You should accessorize with complementary colors in small doses. * The colors next to your dress color are its analogous colors. These colors will work extremely well together and are easy to look at. To use analogous colors most effectively, choose one color to dominate (the dress) and one to support it (shoes, scarf, bag). If you want to use the third color, use it as an accent (small jewelry or details). * You may find it helpful to print out a copy of the color wheel and hang it up on the inside of your closet door. That way you can refer to it easily whenever you need to. * It’s generally a good idea to keep your outfit down to three main colors or fewer. 1. Place the most flattering colors nearest to your face. When accessorizing, always place the colors that work best with your undertone (and eyes) nearest to your face—in accessories like your earrings, necklace, or scarf. Colors that don’t look great with your natural coloring should go further away—in accessories like your shoes or bag. 2. Try on accessories in the store as you try your dress on. You may not actually end up buying those particular accessories, but they'll give you a good idea for what kinds of accessories work and don't work with the dress. It’s a nice chance to experiment with different colors or styles without having to spend any money. 3. Don't forget a bag. Nothing can ruin a look faster than forgetting about a good evening bag and just grabbing your day-to-day, overstuffed handbag as you head out the door. Evening dresses are most often complemented by choosing a delicate clutch bag. 4. Select the shoes. When it comes to color, just make sure it complements your overall look. You can go simple and have the shoes match the rest of your outfit, or you can make the shoes your focal point and choose a color that stands out—try sparking red shoes with a little black dress for a unique but sleek look.	.

Admit to yourself that you have a problem. It may be difficult to come to terms with the fact that you suffer from a mental illness, but you can't begin to help yourself until you do. 2. Realize that you are not alone. Panic disorder is a mental illness that many other people share. 3. Understand what panic is. Panic is just excess adrenaline that runs through your body when it's confronted with a possible life-threatening situation. Feelings of panic can be very scary, but the feelings you have are your body telling you to fight or run away from the potential danger. They are actually protecting you, so you shouldn't worry about them. Close your eyes for a second, take a deep breath and rationalize your thoughts. You will come to no harm! 4. Go see a doctor. There is a lot of medication that can help, and there is also fantastic therapy out there that medical professionals can introduce you to. These attacks won't go away without you acknowledging them, and they can restrict your life dramatically. Going to a doctor is a necessary step, and does not make you a weaker person. 5. Let people who are close to you know you have a problem. Others can be very annoyed if you act strangely all the time without giving a reason. Those who don't get panic attacks sometimes have a hard time understanding what they are; those who care about you will have an easier time dealing with your problem if they know how you are feeling. Try to explain your situation as clearly as possible; if necessary, go on the Internet and print off some information about panic attacks for them to read. You may be surprised at how supportive they will be. 6. Try keeping a diary of when your attacks happen and where, and try to avoid those situations.	Instead, let the feelings of panic come and wash over you, and they will pass soon if you let them.

And then when you re-apply your makeup, you may be dabbing your powder brush through the powder and patting your entire face with it almost every time you powder again. 2.

Should you care that there is silence? Some people feel more comfortable than others during 'awkward' silences. These people may not particularly enjoy meaningless small talk. They may even enjoy silence: a comfortable silence can be a sign of closeness between two people. If so, just try to relish in the silence for a bit. If the silence is indeed awkward for both parties, continue to the next steps.center 2. Ascertain the reason for the silence. Is the silence awkward because you are with new, hard-to-read in-laws? Or because parents have just come into the room? Or because you're with a friend when s/he got into trouble while you were over? All will need different handling.	center

Beware of some people's motives. If a person suddenly wants to be friends, you might be drawn into it. Be careful of people using you because of your talent, intellectual abilities etc. When friendships of these kinds end (they always do), you'll be more drawn into yourself and more shy and awkward! You'll also hurt your confidence and feelings! 2. Be careful before letting your friend on to your secrets. These 'friends' may bleat about it to everyone. * In fact, always avoid telling close secrets to anyone! You never know how things will change. * Avoid sharing passwords with them, for your new friend might hack your account and send your connections rude messages. 3. See if they always want help from you, but make some excuse when you request a favor from them. These friends see you as a ready made help machine, and want to use you to the fullest potential. Decline requests as politely as you can. 4. Gently distance yourself from them. Don't make it obvious, but keep them at arm's length. If it is very noticeable, they will understand and treat you badly. * Lessen your interaction with people, and if these fake friends question you why you are not talking to them, go all dramatic nd tell them that you are preparing very hard at the moment, and you are undergoing a lot of stress, and are not finding time to talk. That's why you have to stop talking with everyone. 5. Avoid huge, emotional outbursts. It just makes you look like a person who can't keep their emotions in control. *	Do your business, even though you are feeling very torn up inside.

Allow yourself to grieve. Having your heart stomped on is going to be painful. You can't get around the fact that it is going to hurt. This means that you have to give yourself time to feel the emotions associated with heartache. Your brain is telling you that you've been injured so don't try to suppress those feelings.center * Create a healing space for yourself. You need time and space to process your emotions and to grieve. When the first heartache comes through, try to find a quiet place to deal with the immediate tidal wave of emotions. This can mean going for a walk, going to your room, making yourself a cup of tea. * You will tend to cycle through emotions like anger, pain, grief, anxiety, fear, acceptance. It can feel a bit like you're drowning at times, but you'll find as you go through each cycle of feelings that you deal with them more easily and more quickly. * Avoid wallowing in despair, however. There's a fine line between giving yourself time to deal with your emotions and being completely overwhelmed by them. If you find that you haven't left your house in weeks, haven't showered, and aren't interested in anything, you should seek professional help, because this is not healthy coping with heartache.	.

Speak up within reason. If something is bothering you, let her know. It does you no good to keep it inside. Perhaps it bothers you that she sets rules and you prefer that your dad do that. Talk to her in private, away from any distractions, and bring her behavior to her attention. Chances are, she’s unaware about how she is affecting you. * When doing so, use “I” statements to communicate what you need. Using “You” statements can sound argumentative. For example, saying “You always tell me to do chores right when I am doing homework!” sounds different from “I feel a lot of pressure because I have a lot of homework. Is it okay if I do those chores tomorrow instead?” * Keep your composure when speaking with her. If you are too focused on rejecting her and not giving her a chance, chances are, she will not listen to you. 2. Choose your battles carefully. Your stepmom is not going anywhere, the best thing to do is to try and get along with her. Fight the battles you can win and you will be more successful. 3. Start fresh. It’s never too late to try to resolve things with your step mom. Let her know that you don’t like how things have evolved and you’d like to start again. If necessary, apologize to her, and mean it. You might see that this can be the start of a whole new relationship. * Find ways to spend time with her, such as suggesting a bike ride or movie. It may not be easy at first, but you can always use the same communications skills you would use on any other new person that comes to your life. 4. Make sure that you have reasonable expectations. If you think that life with your step mom will be exactly like how it was before, you are in for a big disappointment. Remember that she is human too, and like any other human, she has faults. Expecting more out of her is just setting her up for failure, which, hurts you and isn’t fair to her. 5. Ignore her. If she continues to behave the same way after repeated attempts to keep the peace, it might be best to ignore her. Sometimes step moms can get really bossy and are over controlling. It’s hard to talk to someone who is bossy all the time. Choose to ignore her behavior and don’t let her get to you.	As a famous poet, Mary Engelbreit says, “If you don’t like something, change it; if you can’t change it, change the way you think about it.”

Call a meeting with your father. If you are unsure how to relate to your stepmom, ask your dad if you can sit down and discuss it with him. Brainstorm ideas with your therapist or counselor of the best ways to approach him, and constructive suggestions for how to make your family life better. If you explain your frustrations clearly and do not get angry, you are more likely to get a good response. Most likely, your father will have some good ideas as to how you can better relate to your stepmom and will be happy to advise you. * ”Dad, I’m feeling confused and sad. It’s a lot harder to adjust to having a stepmom than I thought. Do you have any good ideas?” * ”I’m not sure how to treat my stepmom. She’s not my real mom, but she’s also not just your girlfriend anymore. What do you think I should do?” * ”I wanted to talk to you about some of the changes that are going on in our family. I’m feeling uncomfortable with my stepmom and I’m not sure what to do about it.” 2. Talk to other kids with stepparents. There are plenty of blended families everywhere and chances are you have a friend or two that has a stepparent. Getting advice from someone your age who is in a similar situation can prove to be very valuable.	.

Decide whether or not you want to use cloth or disposable diapers. You can also use both styles. One reason to do this is because you save some money by not using as many disposable diapers. In this case you can alternate your use of the different types of diapers. For example on some nights you can wear cloth diapers to bed and on other nights you can wear disposables to bed. Another reason to use both kinds of diapers is because some people find cloth diapers covered with plastic pants uncomfortable to wear during warmer times of the year such as spring and summer. In that case the individual switches to disposable diapers.Finally alternating your use of disposable and cloth diapers can cut down on the wear and tear that can occur from laundering cloth diapers. Some people say that they've had cloth diapers last for years, but some wear still does occur to a certain extent and using both types of diapers has the potential to make the diapers last longer. 2. If you decide on using cloth diapers pick which style you want to wear to bed. One style of cloth diaper that is very effective for managing bedwetting are pin-on style cloth diapers. Although somewhat old fashioned there are some people who use these types of diapers on their babies. In addition there are incontinent adults who still use pin-on style diapers. Some of the advantages of pin-on diapers include the following: Pin-on diapers are customizable to a large degree-they offer a great deal of flexibility with being able to adjust the diapers to fit different body types as well as flexibility with how you layer the diapers and how many diapers you can add(this in turn allows for more effective protection), they tend to be the most durable style of diaper(pin-on diapers have been called the “workhorse” of the diaper world by some people), and this style of diaper can double as a tool for use in household tasks such as dusting, car washing, and other chores. These are just some of the advantages of using pin-on diapers. On the other hand some individuals might find the pins to be a hassle.That being said, it might be worth experimenting with this style of diaper due to how effective they are with nighttime protection. There are different fabrics used for cloth diapers-flannel, birds-eye cotton, as well as gauze. Gauze diapers are presumably very comfortable to wear particularly during warmer weather in addition to being highly effective for managing bedwetting, although there are people who prefer the other fabric styles also. * There are other types of cloth diapers besides pin-on style diapers. These styles of diapers have different ways of fastening the diapers. These include cloth diapers with Velcro fasteners, cloth diapers with snaps on the sides, as well as pull on diapers which are also known as diaper pants. While these styles are worn by some people there are some disadvantages with these diapers: pull-on cloth diapers tend to be less absorbent than pin-on diapers for heavier forms of incontinence such as bedwetting, in some instances the cloth diapers with Velcro fasteners have problems with the Velcro wearing out after a certain number of washings, and the snaps on snap on diapers can break. These are some of the other reasons why the adult who wets the bed may want to consider using pin-on cloth diapers if they want to try cloth diapers. The only reason it might not be advisable to use this style of cloth diaper is if the person has some cognitive and/or physical disability that might make it difficult for him or her to handle the pins. For instance the tremors associated with neurological diseases such as Parkinson's can effect a person's dexterity and therefore would make it difficult for this individual to diaper themselves using this type of diaper. There is a slight learning curve associated with using pin-on diapers but there is plenty of information online that talks about how to pin on diapers.With these caveats in mind, a person needs to decide for him or herself what type of diaper(or combination of diapers) works best for them. Kelly's Closet(www.kellyscloset.com) has an illustrated step-by-step guide on how to fold and pin on cloth diapers. Although the instructions are for baby diapers they are also applicable to adult size pin-on diapers. The ""newspaper"" and ""angel wing"" folds seem like the easiest folds to do. To find this section, go to the top of the website and click on cloth diapers, a pull down menu will appear. Then click on the section on prefold and flat diapers. Then it will say cloth diapering 101. That is where the information on folding cloth diapers is. 3. Purchase other diapering supplies. If you do decide to wear pin-on cloth diapers there are a number of supplies you'll need to buy. Waterproof pants must be worn over cloth diapers because unlike disposable diapers there is no waterproof outer layer to keep clothes and bedding dry. Plastic pants(which many people call “rubber pants”, even though this is a misnomer) are the most popular type of waterproof pants and in general are the most durable type of waterproof pants. Plastic pants are also known as ""vinyl pants"", vinyl being a type of plastic. There are several brands of plastic pants and cloth diapers which are recommended by adults suffering from incontinence particularly those with bedwetting problems. These brands and where to purchase them are discussed on the blog “Tips on Managing Bed-Wetting.” This blog also lists several places that sell adult size disposable diapers. * Other supplies that you have to purchase are safety pins for fastening the diapers. Diaper pins can be found at places such as Walmart in the baby section, places that sell adult size cloth diapers, as well as similar places. Fabric stores such as Jo Anne Fabrics should also have safety pins which may be suitable for using with cloth diapers. Other supplies you may need are a diaper pail(if you decide on washing the cloth diapers and plastic pants all at once) , diaper rash products such as Desitin, A&D ointment, Balmex, and petroleum jelly(Vaseline being an example), and baby powder. Incontinence wipes are another product that you might consider purchasing. Baby wipes can be used for this purpose and are found in the baby section of places such as Walmart, Target, as well as grocery stores."	.

Understand the common fraction. The fraction consists of three parts: the numerator, which is the top part of the fraction, the slash, which goes between the numbers, and the denominator, which is the bottom part. * The denominator represents how many equal parts there are in the whole. For example, a pizza might be cut into 8 pieces. The denominator for the pizza would then be ""8"". * The numerator represents a part, or parts, of the whole. One slice of the whole pizza would be represented by the numerator ""1"". Four slices would be represented by the numerator ""4"". * In this example, if you ate one slice of pizza, that would be represented as 1/8, or one of eight pieces. If you ate 3 pieces, that would be 3/8. For each slice you eat, you add another number to the numerator: 1/8 = 1 piece, 2/8 = 2 pieces, 3/8 = 3 pieces, etc. 2. Understand the decimal. The decimal, as the name might imply, is based on the number 10, which is what most of our numbering systems are based on. Decimals do not use a slash to indicate what part of the whole is represented. Instead, the whole is considered to be based on 10, 100, 1000, etc. The fraction is represented by the numbers placed to the right of the decimal point. 3. Understand how the two are similar. Fractions and decimals are only differing representations of any value that is less than an integer. The different forms are often used because of the different goals of the people using them. Common weights and measures are often expressed fractions in the United States, but scientific measurements (which require a great deal of precision) are nearly always represented as decimals."	.

So keep on saying to yourself and your mind ""she is my friend,she is my sister,my best friend and she trusts me very much, so i should not break that trust, and that's just because there will not be any other girls who will get close to me like she will and help me out anywhere!"". 5. 5.This generally happens when you are single but there are cases where you will feel affection when you actually have a girlfriend!if you are single then this happens usually because this is a sign that you want somebody with you,but you can not because you generally do not talk to girls with potentials to be your girlfriend,so you actually try to take a friend and have relationship with her. 6. 6.Go for speed dating.set up blind dating...or even have unprotected intercourse.This decreases your affection towards her,i meant infatuation. 7. 7.Never get rattled,never be upset,think ""This is teenage,it will happen ,i just have to control it,,, i should not be worried..."" and once you control it,you will be your mind's master and not your mind! 8. 8\.

Read qoutes about friendship,books on them and stop watching porn for a little while(if you are doing it). 10. 10.Never spend your time thinking about how well you are in life.You will eventually start thinking about her and get depressed. Hang out or party with friends.Also meet new girls and get close to them.Spend time for your hobbies or if you do not have one,develop one and make goals for yourself. 11. 11.You know you will see this person again. They are your best friend and you don't want to lose them. Try to limit your time with them and start spending time with other people (especially girls). Start dating(as i mentioned above) and don't feel obligated to your best friend, they're not dating you. 12. 12.Try to see the funny things, like movies like american pie or watch bloopers!!!! 13. 13.Also think that she accepted you,you get married but then you guys broke up..Think of the pain you will be dealing with at that time loosing a friend like her! 14. 14.Right now,find yourself another best friend,get close to her,i mean her, so much more than you are to your current friend... 15. 15.Do not get angry with your best friend. She does not know about your feelings for them .. If they think that you are crazy, your best friend will stay away from you and then it is all over forever. 16. 16.Keep distant but there is no need to avoid being them but it is better to minimize the time you spend with them to make it easier for you to overcome your feelings for him or her.Tell your best friend that you need some time alone since it is your exams and politely ask them to stop contacting you . Then it will be easy to go back to where your friendship was .But also do not try to avoid your friend.

It's always refreshing to see a celebrity take responsibility for their actions and make restitution. Recently, Mel Gibson completed his probationary period for having a DUI and had it removed from his record. He attended AA and also did community service. More importantly, he hasn't had another DUI offense in the ensuing time period. He likely had good representation as well, such as could be provided by a Sarasota DUI attorney. Thanks to that and his effort to take responsibility, he is putting the incident behind him and moving on. This is just one advantage that having a qualified attorney can provide. 2. Everyone is aware that it is just not smart to drive while impaired. It's dangerous, both to you and to other drivers on the road. However, many people make poor judgment calls, usually a onetime event, and end up paying dearly for it. As a first time offender, you really need to call in a Sarasota DUI lawyer. They can advise you better than anyone else on what to expect and are prepared to mitigate the consequences as much as possible. 3. There are several things to look at when you are searching for a good DUI attorney. First, the record of the Sarasota DUI attorney is very important. If they can't show a track record of successful cases, you probably want to keep looking.	Not having your case settled in your favor can cost you big, so it's much better to give that money to your lawyer instead. However, up and coming lawyers can still do a good job. Again, check their record to determine the percentage of cases that have been successfully won. Be prepared to share your story when you go in for a consultation. Most DUI attorneys will talk to you for free, so this is a great opportunity to determine who will work the hardest for you.

If you want a body piercing or tattoo, have the number of the establishment or some reliable websites about the practice. 3. Don't let them give you an answer right away. Tell them to get back to you in two or three days with any questions or concerns they have. Let them know that this is not a childish wish- that you want to discuss this as mature, responsible adults and you are willing to work through issues. 4. If the answer is no, simply walk away and tidy your room, feed the dog, wash the car or something similar. You will need to try again at another time. Keep showing that you are responsible, and your parents might change their minds. 5. Don't do anything bad while you're trying to convince them or they won't listen at all! 6.

Choose a color. Are you buying a dress shirt for a job interview, or are you looking to dress up more fashionably? * For an interview, the traditional choices are conservative colors. A light blue is usually the safest. White is very formal. Grays are also generally safe. * If you are looking to portray a more lively image, choose bright, unconventional colors. Bright greens and oranges are relatively popular, as well as pink. 2. Choose a pattern. Solid colors are considered wardrobe staples because they are easiest to match, but you might consider choosing stripes or a plaid pattern. * Solid shirts are beneficial in that you can wear virtually any tie with them [solid or patterned]. * Patterned shirts are a bit more difficult to match with ties. 3. Choose a style. Are you looking for a more trendy, tapered-cut shirt, or would you prefer to stick with a standard, full-cut shirt? Do you want a standard collar, or a spread collar? Will your collar be buttoned down, or will you use collar stays? Each of these are points to consider. * A tailored-fit, or slim-fit dress shirt is slightly tighter around the chest and sides. A standard-fit dress shirt has a slightly baggy, but traditional ""full-cut"" appearance."	.

Therefore, ensure to unravel any hidden costs related to software maintenance, hardware upgrades, additional implementation costs, etc. 4. Create a comprehensive implementation plan: It is always advisable to devise an all-inclusive ERP project implementation plan well beforehand. This plan should not only include activities required for installing the system, but should also entail the list of resources responsible for ensuring that the solution is tested, optimally functional and well-accepted by end users. * Make sure to devise this plan prior to finalising a particular ERP software in order to acknowledge the resource and cost requisites to make its implementation a huge success. * Further, the implementation plan ought to include all the nitty-gritty right from workflow design to test iterations and data migration to core organizational activities. 5. Project the potential perks of the new ERP software: Failing to do so plays a huge spoilsport for a successful ERP rollout. For instance, if a business intends to curb costs, boost revenue and scalability, then it is essential to assess and project ERP software’s benefits against these three metrics. 6.

Many business owners tend to commit the grave mistake of choosing a solution based on what their competitors are opting for or go for a solution simply based on brand name.

Using soap and water to clean the moissanite is the easiest way. It is also very effective. First, take a bowl or small container and fill it with warm water. Into this container, add several drops of a mild liquid soap. Make sure that the soap is not harsh or contains too many chemicals, as this can damage the jewelry. 2. Next, place your moissanite jewelry into the soapy water and using a soft cloth, begin to wipe the surface of the stone and the jewelry setting. For the areas that are difficult to get to with the cloth, you can use a soft brush, like a toothbrush. 3. After this, rinse the moissanite under clean running water. Wash away all the soap until the jewelry is clean and thoroughly cleaned. 4.	Try to find a cloth that does not contain lint as these will catch onto the jewelry. Wiping the jewelry is important to ensure that no soap stains are left on the moissanite or the settings.

And it doesn't necessarily have to be a beautiful tie; what makes a great tie doesn't necessarily make a great egg. If you don't have any laying around, ties (even silk ones) can be found super cheap at most thrift shops. 2. Cut up the seam. This should double the size of your tie, giving you a piece large enough to work with. Cut out a section that can easily wrap around your egg. * You'll need a section of your material that fits the egg and can be held together; a couple extra inches (5 cm) at least is necessary. 3. Wrap your egg in the tie and in an extra layer of fabric. For the tie material, have the right side (the side you would see if you were wearing it) directly touching the egg. For the material on top of that, you'll just need a lightweight, light colored material. A pillowcase is perfect. * Wrap the egg in the tie material with a twisty tie. A string works, too, but a twisty tie is much easier to work with. Make sure the part of the pattern you want is on the part of the egg you want it on. Then wrap on the light material in the same manner. 4. Boil 'em. Put them in a pot and cover them with water.	Boil, boil, and boil for about 20 minutes.

Learn about healthy eating. Learn about the basics of good eating and nutrition. This may make it easier to gradually switch out your bad habits and food choices for good ones. * Choose foods from the five food groups at each meal and make sure to vary choices from meal to meal so that you get plenty of nutrients. The five food groups are: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy. * Eat 1-1.5 cups of fruit daily. Fruits like raspberries, blueberries, or cherries are good choices. * Eat 2.5-3 cups of vegetables daily. Broccoli, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes are good choices. * Eat 5-8 ounces of grains daily. Half of this amount should be whole grains from foods like brown rice, quinoa, or whole wheat bread. * Eat 5-6.5 ounces of protein daily. Lean meats like pork or chicken, cooked beans, eggs, or nuts are good choices. * Get 2-3 cups of dairy daily. Cheese, yogurt, milk, and even ice cream are good choices. 2. Clean your pantry. Remove any foods from your pantry that influence bad eating habits. This can reinforce the gradual changes you are making. * Choose foods that are cues or triggers for you, such as chips, candy, or processed meals. * Donate unused food to a local food bank. 3. Stock your pantry with healthy choices. Buy a selection of healthy choices to restock your pantry. Having mostly or only healthy options can reinforce good habits and help you avoid cues and triggers. * Avoid going overboard with buying food, which can cause some people to revert to overeating. This might require that you shop more often, but may also keep you on track with healthy habits. * Get options like whole wheat pasta, oatmeal, or brown rice so that you can avoid bad eating habits when you’re in a pinch. * Keep herbs and spices to jazz up meals and give you flavor that might make you crave bad foods. 4. Enjoy restaurants. Eating out can cue bad habits for many people.	.

Step 1: Identify your Data Center Needs: Work with a team that has representatives from Facilities, IT and Management to find out what they need. A good time to invest in Data Center Infrastructure Management Software would be if you are planning a data center move or thinking of building a new data center. 2. Step 2: Prioritize Your Data Center Needs: You may be suffering from existing problems like figuring out where to put new servers, storage and network equipment, or you may be falling back on keeping track of the status of work in the data center. You could also cut down costs by investing in DCIM software if you are paying for data center space in a hosted facility. Instead of paying flat rates, you can now track your exact usage and pay accordingly. The most common reason cited for deploying DCIM, however, is to increase energy efficiency via PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) and environmental monitoring. Select the areas that are most relevant to you and decide on those that must be addressed and ones that can be deprioritized. 3. Step 3: Appoint a DCIM Lead: It will be worthwhile to appoint a person who has experience in both sides of DCIM, the data center structure as well as the housed equipment. If the person is well versed with the best practices of DCIM he/she will be able to stage the deployment depending on the organization's needs. It could either begin with components that monitor facilities or those that manage assets, but will eventually move towards integrating both sides. 4. Step 4: Consider Working with Existing Systems: If you already have some existing software to help with network monitoring or cooling visualization, you will not want to duplicate those features in the new system. In fact, you could also explore the option of integrating your current systems into one dashboard, since this would be a cost effective solution for your data center needs. If this is not sufficient, find out what additional sensors and hardware you may need to collect data. 5. Step 5: Estimate the Cost: Once you are clear about your DCIM needs, it will be easier to compute the estimated cost of meeting them. The most apparent cost in deploying DCIM is the hardware. However, there are several other costs that need to be accounted for, including the cost of installation. The potential implications of the service-level agreement need to be analyzed, along with the cost of downtime during installation.	There may also be additional costs for a certain items to be monitored.

Let's pretend you want a ball python. Your parents are sitting on the couch after dinner. This is the perfect time to talk to them. They are in a good mood and they are together.You sit next to them and bring the subject around to snakes. You talk about ball pythons for a little bit and then, you say, ""Could I have a ball python for a pet?"" They say ""No"" but you don't give up. You tell them about ball pythons and talk about why they are great pets to have. They ask questions, all of which you answer. You ask them why they don't like the idea of a pet snake. Then you give a solution to the problem. If your mom thinks it would be too much work, tell her how low-maitnence most snakes are. 2. Do more research once you've let your parents know. You should be able to recite how to care for your dream pet. The more you know, the better your chances of changing your parent's minds. Learn the feeding requirements, the cage setup they need, the general temperment of that breed of snake, and you MUST know is they are good first-time snakes. For example: You wna t a ball python and your parents know it. You spend weeks researching everything about them. You know what they eat, how often you feed them, cage requirements, temperment, and cost. You are ready to take the next step. If you don't know all this and more, do more research. 3. If you are sure you know everything you need to know, talk again. Make sure your parents are in good moods. They should have hours of freetime and they should be togther. Tell them again you want a snake but this time go into more detail about the snake. Don't go over everything, unless your parents ask. Don't beg or whine. Sometimes, your parents will say yes. If that is the case, you are good to go. However, lots of parents need more convincing. Lets use the ball python example again. You are at the dinner table with your family. Start talking about ball pythons. Chances are, your parents will remember you want one. If they don't, remind them. You tell them about the basic care of ball pythons, and why you want one. Your parents seem skeptical, and you don't push it. As long as they didn't say ""no"" there is still hope. Now they know you are commited to getting a ball python. 4. Know what to do if they refuse. You have talked with your parents, but they still won't say yes. It is time for some more drastic moves. Compose an email to your parents about snake ownership. It should be long and well written. Make sure everything is spelled correctly. The email should make sense and sound persuasive. Don't make it sound whiney or annoying. Then, compile a list of links to articles or youtube videos about why you should be allowed to have a snake. The more specific, the better. Here's an example: Your parents still are not letting you get a ball python. So, you write them an email talking about your want of a ball python. You tell them you will take care of it and that you know for sure that this is the pet you want."	You also make some extra links not in the email in case your parents want more info. All you can do is hit send and hope.

Talk with your doctor. The first step in finding a surgeon and location for your operation is talking with your primary care provider. They will likely recommend surgeons and hospitals that they have worked with in the past. Often, your choice of surgeon will determine your choice of hospital. * When you are talking to your doctor, ask things like “Who would recommend as a surgeon?” and “What hospital do you recommend?” 2. Check with your insurer. After you consult your doctor, you should contact your insurer. Unless you are willing to pay out-of-pocket for the surgery, you will need to make sure that any surgeon and you go to is in-network. Depending on the surgery, an out-of-network operation may end up costing you thousands of dollars. * When you talk to your insurer, ask questions like “What specialists are covered by my insurance?” and “Is this surgeon in-network?” 3. Look for hospitals that have expertise in treating your condition.	General hospitals are great for routine operations like hernias or gallbladder surgery. However, you may need a specialty hospital if you need something like bypass or reconstructive surgery. Talk with your primary care provider and your insurer to find the facility that meets your needs and is affordable.

"This is helpful, because when you need to reinstall your operating system,you can just use the Nero Disk to get to the ""A"" prompt,then switch directorys to the partition of the uninstalled OS ,and install from there(Use d:\win98se\win98...then type ""setup"" , for instance if you are using windows 98se,and you put the uninstalled version on the D drive.)

This may be hard, but accepting that MySpace has taken over your life is an important step into overcoming your addiction. If you simply can't resist the urge to check your home page, then it's clear that MySpace is controlling you and not the other way around. 2. Stop communicating with people whom you know and correspond with only through MySpace, as these fellow addicts only contribute to your problem. If you don't want to cut them off completely, consider just taking the friendships that you value off of MySpace. Get their phone numbers, email addresses, AIM screen names, ICQ numbers, or any other information that may be a way of contacting them outside of MySpace. (See Tips.) 3. Print out your page. You've probably personalized it and tweaked it to reflect your personality. In a way, it's a work of art that you created. You don't want it to be lost forever, so save a copy in print. Having a hard copy will make it easier to let go of your profile online. 4. Start deleting all of the images, comment boxes, background settings, songs, videos, and anything else you put on the page that didn't come with it. Make it into a plain MySpace profile, like it was when you started it. 5. Post several bulletins announcing that you will be no longer available on MySpace. 6. Delete your main pictures, blog, comments, friends, etc. If your profile is set to private, set it back to normal. Reset the information about yourself. 7. Change the headline to ""No Longer Available"" or some other indicator that you no longer use MySpace. 8. Stop using MySpace. Get a filter and set it to block MySpace, Facebook, or any other similar sites. Find other creative activities to do."	.

Notice if this person blushes or gets nervous around you. A shy person who doesn't tend to read social cues easily (as these two are not the same) is sometimes just as unable to receive advances as they are to make them, and their nerves will tell on them in one way or another. 2. Convince this person that your interest is genuine. One good conversation won't be enough to earn their trust. You may find that after having a great interaction, the person will seemingly avoid you. They might be testing your interest, or might not be sure of what to do. Unless you see a really persistent negative trend, just continue to make slow, respectful advances. 3. Tell them something about yourself. Just be friendly and calm. Speak in a low tone, as if you only intend for them to hear the story. Giving them a little information about you might make them less nervous about sharing information about themselves - a ""you show me yours and I'll show you mine"" sort of deal. 4. Ask questions. Avoid questions with ""yes"" or ""no"" answers; try to get the person to talk a little. The reaction will vary, depending on the person. Some introverted, shy, or otherwise distant people are animated with people that they know, while others are consistently aloof. 5. The person may or may not catch hints, depending on how well they read social cues. This is possible with both introverts and extroverts. 6. Listen and take what they say seriously. Even if it seems like a half-hearted or thoughtless statement, this is often just a shyness or uneasiness in attempting to express what they actually feel. It's selfish to see their awkwardness at revealing feelings as a barrier; you care about this person, so make the effort instead of placing up your own barrier by turning that person into a challenge. 7. Pay close attention to facial expressions and body language. Introverts will not always say what they are thinking. You have to be especially observant in order to figure out what they are thinking."	A small, forced smile could be a sign to back off a bit.

Communicate_With_Older_Adults.txt	Begin_Revision	0.761	## Steps	146	"""""""In addition , reduce the """""""" noise """""""" in your sentences and questions ."""""""	## Steps	185	"""""""Reduce the """""""" noise """""""" in your sentences and questions ."""""""	<delete><In><1>|||<delete><addition><2>|||<delete><,><3>|||<replace><reduce><4><Reduce><1>	True	Steps  1. Be aware of the person's health problems. Older adults may have health problems that add difficulty to speaking and understanding. For example, they may have hearing problems, speech problems, and memory loss. These factors complicate communication. Be sure you consider the person's health before you engage in communication. And remember, chronological age is not always a true indicator of a person’s health. 2. Be attentive to the environment you are communicating in. Hearing and speech problems can create a barrier. Be sure to evaluate the environment you are communicating in. Is there any disturbing background noise? Are there many people speaking in the same room? Is there any intrusive music? Are there any distractions that can affect your communication? Ask the older adult if the environment is comfortable to them. If you sense any disturbance, try to go to a more peaceful and quiet place. 3. Speak clearly, articulate, and make eye contact. Older adults may have trouble hearing. It is important to articulate and speak clearly. Direct your speech at the individual and not to the side of the person. Do not eat your words. Move your mouth and pronounce each word carefully and precisely. If your tongue “dances” inside your mouth when you talk, you articulate. If your tongue “sleeps” and plays a passive role, you do not articulate. 4. Adjust your volume appropriately. There is a difference between enunciating and talking loudly. Learn to adapt your voice to the needs of the individual. Evaluate the environment you are in and the person’s hearing. Sometimes, it is sufficient to interact in a quiet place. Never shout at an older adult. Treat the individual with respect by articulating and speaking at a comfortable volume that is suitable for both of you. 5. Use clear, precise questions and sentences and repeat and rephrase. Complicated questions and sentences may confuse older adults who have memory and hearing loss. Clear and precise constructions are easier to comprehend. Use direct questions: “Did you have soup for lunch?” “Did you have salad for lunch?” It may be more difficult to answer: “What did you have for lunch?” The more precise you are in your language, the less difficulty the elderly have to understand.	Limit your sentences and questions to 20 words or less. Deconstruct complex ideas. For example, it may be better to say, “Is there any pain in your back (pointing to the person’s back or your back)? Is there any pain in your stomach (pointing to the person’s stomach or your stomach)?” A more complicated construction would be: “Do you have any pain or discomfort?” Do not hesitate to repeat and rephrase your sentences and questions if you sense there is an absence of comprehension.

Ask yourself why you spend so much time on wikiHow. Are you feeling lonely, undervalued, lost, depressed? Or perhaps you have an obsessive need for tidiness or you're just too lazy to get up from the terminal? If you are feeling sadness, depression or you have lost your way, wikiHow is not going to solve these feelings for you. While instant gratification through seeing your changes in print is a great feeling, it isn't a lasting one and you may find yourself needing this fix more and more. Just as with any addictive behavior... If you have such feelings, it is important to seek some friendly or professional assistance and work through the feelings. On the other hand, if you are plain lazy, it is time to go and book a gym session or walk your dogs. 2. Accept that wikiHow isn't going away. It is a project for life. You can leave it and return a week, month, year later and it will still be here. You cannot fix wikiHow's myriad edits in need of mending by sitting at the computer all day every day trying to do so. This is a losing battle because more things are always being added. Respect your editing craft and edit what is worth editing. Don't turn it into a crusade to fix everything that is here. After all, there are many, many editors here and you have to leave them something to do... 3. Realize that wikiHow is not an infinite source of knowledge. Many things can only be learned by doing them. Sure you can read on the site how to do them but the proof of the pudding is in the doing. Go and try what you read. Maybe you will find better ways of doing the acitivity and you can later return and add your suggested ways for improving the activity.	.
Choose_an_Over‐the‐Counter_Laxative.txt	Begin_Revision	0.819	### Considering Your Needs	180	However , they are also more likely to cause side effects .	### Comparing Different Oral and Rectal Laxatives	247	They are also more likely to cause side effects .	<delete><However><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><they><3><They><1>	True	Considering Your Needs  1. Figure out the effect you desire. There is a wide variety of over-the-counter laxatives available. Each has different effects on your intestinal tract and body. Taking the time to figure out what effect you want the laxative to have can help you choose the right product for yourself. Ask yourself questions such as: * How long have I been constipated? * Did I try to relieve my constipation with diet, beverages, or exercise? * Did I use any other methods to relieve my constipation? * Do I want a laxative I take orally or rectally? * Do I want a laxative with a stimulant? * Do I want a laxative that works very quickly or within a few hours? * Do I have any special health considerations? 2. Try oral laxatives for relief. There are several different types of oral laxatives you may want to try. They relieve constipation in different ways and have different side effects. They work by triggering muscle contractions or softening your stool. You may want to take an oral laxative if you want something that works slightly slower than a rectal option or if you don’t want to insert it in your anus. The following types of oral laxatives may work best for you: * Oral osmotics, such as Milk of Magnesia or Miralax. These draw water into the colon and allow easier stool passage. They may have side effects such as bloating, cramping, and gas. * Oral bulk formers such as Benefiber, Citrucel and Metamucil. These absorb water to form a soft, bulky stool for normal intestinal contraction. They may have side effects such as bloating, gas, or cramping. * Oral stool softeners such as Colace and Surfak. These add moisture to your stool and provide strain-free bowel movements. They may cause electrolyte imbalances, especially if used longer-term. * Oral stimulants such as Dulcolax and Senokot. These trigger your intestinal muscles to contract and evacuate stool. They may have side effects such as burping, cramping, and nausea. 3. Use rectal laxatives for quick relief. Rectal laxatives are often used as enemas or suppositories to stimulate a bowel movement in a short period of time. Some companies that make oral laxatives also make rectal versions. Some common rectal laxatives include Colace, Ducolax Bowel Cleansing Kit, Fleet Glycerin, and The Magic Bullet. All rectal laxatives may cause cramping, rectal irritation, and stomach discomfort. You may want to try: * Hyperosmotic laxatives such as glycerin (polyethylene glycol) and sodium phosphate. These draw water into the bowel and increase its action. * Lubricants such as mineral oil. These coat the bowel to make your stool more slippery. This makes evacuating your bowels easier. * Stimulants, or contact laxatives, such as biscodyl and senna. These increase muscle contractions that help move the stool mass out of your bowel. These are the harshest type of laxatives. * Emollients, or stool softeners, such as docusate. These help prevent dry and hard stool masses that allow you to evacuate your bowels without straining. 4. Exercise caution with combination laxatives. Some companies offer products that combine different types of laxatives. One example is a stimulant and a stool softener. Combinations may be more effective than a simple oral or rectal laxative.	.
Deal_With_Parents_Who_Hoard.txt	Begin_Revision	0.951	## Steps	351	And blocking the air flow of appliances with stacks of clutter can cause them to overheat and spark a fire .	## Steps	425	Blocking the air flow of appliances with stacks of clutter can cause them to overheat and spark a fire .	<delete><And><1>|||<replace><blocking><2><Blocking><1>	True	"Steps  1. Understand why people hoard. There are complex reasons behind hoarding. In the case of parents, some of the reasons might include: * A parent who has lost a lot in life may feel compelled to hang onto things out of fear of future loss––the loss may have been a job, family members or family structure, houses, items, etc. * A parent who is suffering from depression, anxiety or a mental illness may derive comfort from hanging onto things; initially the items hoarded may carry some meaning that gets lost over time but the hoarding instinct remains. * Sometimes a parent may be trying to create a sense of stability during difficult times, such as when moving around a lot or job hopping, and stuff makes up the gap in between the uncertainty of life in general and the certainty of things. * In some cases, a parent may be trying to hang onto everything in the vain hope that all these things will be useful for you some day––in this case, the challenge of hoarding may be coupled with the many dreams the parent holds for you, none of which really equate to who you are or what you wish to do in life. * Hoarding can creep up unawares on parents who feel unable to let go of all the mementos that have filled their parenting years, due to the emotional pain of letting go of their child's paintings, art projects, report cards, written work, books, toys, clothes, etc. * Finally, but very importantly, hoarding can be associated with grief, as the hoarder wants to ""hold on"" to a deceased person by keeping objects that the loved one gave to them. In some cases this can be the equivalent of an entire extra household's worth of goods! 2. Acknowledge how the hoarding makes you feel. It is reasonable to feel annoyed, frustrated or overwhelmed by clutter in your life, especially where you have no control over its growth. At the same time, while your feelings are important, they must be balanced with compassion. Your parents aren't doing this to hurt you––they may very well not even grasp how much their hoarding impacts you. By understanding that hoarding is a compulsive disorder, you can see that it isn't directed at you personally. For your own sake, remind yourself that dealing with this is about finding ways to cope rather than taking it out on yourself. * Be alert to the ways the hoarding impacts you, such as isolating you from friends, causing shame and preventing you from having privacy. Your feelings are legitimate and deserving of attention too; take care not to submerge your needs in caring for your needy parents. * Don't get mad if your parents hoard––anger won't solve anything. * You cannot ""make"" someone change; but you can strongly suggest that they change. This is your strength, in recognizing what is happening and being prepared to help do something about it. 3. Try to understand your parents' point of view. Remember, you're not trying to attack them, you are rather trying to re-channel their actions into more positive ones that will help both them and the family as a whole. Instead of being a antagonist, see their side of the story first. You might try some of the following: * Ask them about their feelings toward the objects they're hoarding and what the objects represent. This can help you to form ideas about ways to display or rearrange things in a way that minimizes them (and their impact) while still honoring the essence of the objects. * Gently find out how they feel about life generally. Have you noticed if your parents seem sad, down, grieving, lost or any other feelings that might cause them to remain stuck in the past or overwhelmed about something? In some cases, getting them away from the home environment for a trip or for events might prove beneficial if your parents spend most of their time housebound. * Identify the signs of hoarding. Do your parents constantly make shopping trips for items they don't need and, in many cases, don't even unwrap? Do you find a bunch of older objects that they don't need stacked in the house? Do Mom and Dad refuse to give these items up? 4. Talk to your parents about how you feel. While it's important to acknowledge their feelings, it's also important to express your own feelings. You might not be sure how these will be received––that depends on how well your parents listen and are prepared to face what is happening. In some cases, they may not really get how this is affecting you, or they may be tempted to diminish the impact on you. Try not to take this personally––your parents have a compulsive disorder that isn't directed at you but is a symptom of their own broader malaise. At the very least, air your feelings to help you make sense of how the hoarding impacts you. Using ""I feel sad when you hoard"" is appropriate. If they are invested in you, they will at least value your feelings. 5. Tell them the dangers. As part of your discussion with your parents, it may help to explore some basic facts that go beyond feelings, such as: * The risk of injury from clutter. The more clutter in the home, the more danger that can result when items fall down, when people trip over them, etc. This is especially of concern for the less nimble, elderly parent, who may be trapped by items that fall onto them. However, it can impact people of any age, such as keeping things on the staircase making it hard to go up and down the stairs, which could potentially cause someone to fall and be injured. * Fire danger increases with clutter. Flammable materials such as newspapers, magazines, paper stacks, etc. can present a fire hazard when accumulated. The danger intensifies if the materials block access or they're stacked near sources of heat, such as furnaces, stoves and heaters."	.

Respect your child's choice. Your son loves this woman, no matter that you can't understand what he sees in her. Remember the old song, ""When a man loves a woman...If she is bad, he can't see it, She can do no wrong, Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down."" This is absolute truth - so in dealing with her, no matter what your true feelings are, you must never say a word against her to your son. 2. Stay cordial at all times. She may be a clueless, crude boor. She may be vulgar and crass. She may swear like a sailor while your family is a church-going, proper group. She may actually be unkind, cruel, or a manipulative, controlling narcissist, not caring about imposing on others as long as she gets whatever she wants. There is nothing you can do about this. Just be polite, as you would be to a stranger. The only real exception to this is if you have little kids (your son has siblings who have children, perhaps) around and she's cursing like crazy - then you might say, mildly, ""Ooh - can we watch the language while the kids are here? They get into trouble for saying that word and I don't want them to pick it up here. Thanks."" No matter how creepy she is, stay calm, cool, poised, and polite. 3. Set your boundaries as you are comfortable. Perhaps you don't wish to support this union any more than is absolutely necessary to maintain some relationship with your son. That's your choice, absolutely. So simply set things up so that they are clear from the beginning. If your daughter-in-law makes snide or nasty remarks about another family member (perhaps your other daughter-in-law), say, ""Well, she may not have much fashion sense, but she is one of the sweetest people I know, and I love her very much."" This lets her know, in a calm, non-critical way, that you will not be interested in hearing her snipe at this person. If she drops over unannounced, stop her at the door with a regretful but firm, ""I'm sorry, Allison - I'm just about to go and run my errands, so I need to fly. And you know what - it really is best to give a call ahead, just so I'm not in the shower, or doing my nude dancing or whatever."" Then grin and go back inside. If she tells you she'd like to tag along, let her know you're picking up a friend and this was time you had set aside to visit with that friend. Tell her you only get time with your friend so often, and you would not appreciate her bringing someone else along at the last minute, and that you will respect that little propriety this time, ""...but if you let me know ahead of time that you'll be coming by, I can either reschedule my running around with Bernice, or ask if she'd mind if you joined us - that'd be fine for next time!"" Keep it positive. 4. Remember that she may be the mother of your grandchildren. She will control access to any offspring of your son's that result from the marriage. Your best bet to retain visitation is to maintain a cordial, amicable relationship is to bite your tongue. Don't criticize her parenting, don't get angry if she changes plans at the last minute, leaving you out in the cold when you had planned to have the kids over for the weekend. This is one of the ways that certain people control situations and others (see How to Recognize a Manipulative or Controlling Relationship) - the best you can do is to understand that she has the ultimate say over what happens with her children. And don't kid yourself that you have a lot of rights: courts do not tend to side with grandparents unless the mother and/or father are declared unfit or have been arrested for a felony. Just try as best you can to keep your relationship workable, no matter how bloody your tongue gets. 5. Talk to your son. Careful, though. Don't just unload a litany of your daughter-in-laws hateful traits. Instead, try to take a roundabout approach that is diplomatic and not critical. State the problem, and then request your preferred solution:  * Example 1: Your daughter-in-law was supposed to drop your grandkids off for a 2-night sleepover on Friday night, but didn't show. You wait an hour and a half before finally calling your son, worried and upset. Wisely, you wait a day, then call your son again to discuss a more suitable way to handle such an issue. * You: ""Josh, you asked us if we'd like to take the kids last weekend. Allison was supposed to drop them off around 5pm on Friday night and pick them up at noon on Sunday. Instead, Allison was a no-show on Friday, and when they hadn't arrived by 6:30, we were worried. I had to call you to find out that your plans had changed - and you both knew this since Thursday."" * Joshua (your son) responds: ""Mom, I'm sorry. I thought Allie was calling you, and she thought I was calling you, and it just got lost in the shuffle - we're so busy, and when the plans changed, it was kind of last-minute, so I'm sorry for that."" * You: ""I get that this time was a mixup, but it's happened before, and the thing is, it seems Allison never really ends up calling us when plans change - what ends up happening is that I call you to find out what is going on. This is very inconsiderate, Josh, and you know that. Dad and I have our lives, too, and we're busy, too. We cleared our schedule last weekend so that the kids could come and stay, and Dad turned down an invitation to go fishing with friends. In the future, I would like you to call at least a day ahead if plans change - but definitely, I would like you to be the one to handle it, rather than trusting that Allison will call. I don't want to be the nasty Mother-in-law, causing problems with your wife. But I also don't want to be left hanging, and whether it's intentional or not, that makes me feel like a doormat. So can we agree that in the future, if plans change and you are backing out, you will call, not Allison?"" * Example 2: You have the opposite problem - Allison drops over and wants to leave the kids with you constantly, leaving you little to no time to yourself, and treating you like the hired help and her personal babysitting service - at her beck and call. * You: ""Allison, I'm sorry - I can't take the kids just now."" * Allison: ""Oh, I know it's short notice (really, it's no notice) but please, please, please - I have this thing..."" (as she shoves the kid toward the door) * You: (standing resolutely in the doorway) Honey, I'm sorry, I can't do it this time. I would love to, but I really do need some notice. I have plans that I cannot cancel, and I can't take the kids with me."" * Do not weaken to ""keep peace."" It won't work. She will continue to do this, and you will continue to seethe with anger - and in the end, you may blow up and say something unfortunate which will cause a huge rift in your family. Instead, hold your ground kindly, but firmly, and set this boundary clearly. Later, call your son: * You: ""I guess Allison told you I was ""mean"" today, and couldn't babysit."" * Josh: ""Yeah."" (he probably understands and is not mad at you, but is exasperated that his wife is having a cow about it and doesn't know how to get her off your case) * You: ""I do feel bad about it, but honey, I have a life, too, and lately it really feels like Allison just assumes I will be able to take the kids whenever she feels like going shopping with friends or whatever it is she does. I don't appreciate being taken for granted. I don't want to cause World War III here, and I don't want to hurt her feelings - I love the kids, and I always want to spend time with them, but, Josh, I need a little notice. A little appreciation for the fact that it's not easy for me taking care of little kids - as much as I love them, I'm getting older. I raised my kids and I think I deserve at least the respect of being asked first whether I might be available to babysit, rather than just having them dumped on me. Can you speak to her, please? I think she'd take this better coming from you - but in the future, I really would like for her to call. Even if it's just a couple of hours ahead, at least having the option to say yes or no would make me feel a lot better."" * Again, no matter how clueless and rude you believe Allison has been, it's better to simply deal with your feelings about it rather than criticizing her. Josh will understand, certainly, and if you can get him to talk to his wife rather than leaving it up to you to keep on saying no to her, it will smooth things between you. However - if Josh does try, and it is to no avail because his wife is just one of those people who feels entitled to do whatever she wants no matter how much it inconveniences others, then you will simply have to set your boundary hard and not deviate from it. One suggestion: Never babysit unless your receive 24 hours notice first - but make sure both Josh and Allison are aware of this. State that you have a life of your own and if you are asked a day ahead, you very well may be available to babysit, but past that, you will not be able to. In other words, if she calls and asks for you to babysit an hour from now, you simply say you've already made other plans. If you stand firm on this and don't just allow her to steamroll you, but rather, patiently and calmly just inform her without explaining excessively, she will soon learn that she can't expect this of you. * This is also a good time to practice How to Practice Nonviolent Communication. 6. Accept the reality of the situation. If your son has children with this woman, no matter what you think of her, the children need their mother."	Instead, just come to terms with this: she may not be the daughter-in-law you dreamed of, but she is the daughter-in-law that you have. Choose to have whatever relationship is possible with her, for the sake of keeping contact with your son and grandchildren.

Start with the biggest stuff. Are there any monthly or yearly bills that you need to pay? Some examples would be car payments, rent or mortgage, utilities (such as water, electricity, etc), and insurance (medical, dental, etc). Try to round either up or down to the nearest $10 for an average estimate on how much you spend for each item. 2. Begin by calculating your regular essentials. How much per week do you spend on gas? What is the usual amount that you spend on groceries, or how many times per week do you eat out or get take out instead of home cooking? Think of other essential things that you need, not want. You should spend as normal, but take a receipt or note down every time you get your wallet or purse out. At the end of the day, tally this up, either on paper, your computer or your phone. Make sure you note exactly what you spent it on and don't use a generic term such as food or transport. 3. Create an area for your earnings. Include all earnings, whether it's tips, ""under the table"" jobs (money you take home, without taxes being taken out), money you find on the ground, and your salary (or monthly balance if you're paid every other week). 4. Make an area for your ""Monthly Income"". This is what you take home after taxes are being taken out, if applicable. This is the amount on your paycheck, not your total earnings for the time period. 5. Put your monthly income and your total expenses number side-by-side. Once you have tallied up about a month's worth of expenses, divide up your expenses into the categories of necessities, sanity savers and luxuries. * Luxuries are those big-ticket items that you can cut out or do not provide you with the level of enjoyment worthy of the price. These could range from anything such as expensive nights out to take-away lunches and coffee. According to your money magazine ""if you drop into your local cafe on the way to work each morning, be aware you’re spending $728.20 a year on your morning ritual"", or ""if you buy lunch five days a week, you’ll spend approximately $2,200 this year alone on lunch."" That's not even taking into account those extra coffees or teas throughout the day! * Sanity savers are those items that the level of enjoyment you get from them far out-weigh the financial cost and are not budget busters. For some people, these might be one night out a month with a limit on the spend or a DVD a week. * If the amount of your total expenses is greater than your income, then you need to think about cutting back on your spending or think of ways to cut down your bills. * If your monthly income is higher than your total expenses, put some away in savings. This money can be used towards a second mortgage, college tuition, or anything else big. Or, you can stash some away for something small like a trip to the spa. 6. Work out both weekly and yearly buffers that you can afford. Your weekly cash buffer will mean that if you go slightly over your weekly cash spend limit, it will not affect your hip pocket and will not end up going on the dreaded credit card. By incorporating an annual buffer into your budget, unexpected medical, car or house maintenance costs will also not affect your bottom line. If you get to the end of the year and have not needed to use your buffer for these types of expenses, then great! You will have extra money that you can funnel into your savings or retirement investment plans. 7. Calculate how much your short term, medium term and long term goals are going to cost. Do you need to replace any household items this year? Do you need a new pair of boots this year? Do you want to buy a car? Plan for this in advance and you won't need to draw on your long term savings. Another important point to note is that you should aim to only buy these items after you have saved for them. Ask yourself, do you really need it right now? 8. Draw up a new budget, incorporating your buffers and goals."	Cut out the luxury items and save the sanity savers for those times you are are really pulling your hair out from trying to stick to your new budget. Eventually you will need the sanity savers less and less, and the fact that you have already budgeted for them, means they can go into extra savings when you don't need them.

Make a plan. A well designed plan will be essential in the building process. Plan out the area where you want to build your wall and make sure it is detailed and to scale, so when in the constructing process you won’t have to go off the top of your head and possible make a mistake. 2. Order the materials. You will have a lot of choices to choose from, so take your time and make sure that the color and design will match your home and its surroundings. From your plans estimate how much you will need, with around 10% extra to ensure that you are covered and for a possible mistake. 3. Outline your project area. Using spray paint to draw out the area that you are going to excavate is a good idea or staking it out will work as well. 4. Excavate your area. When digging out the area or trench for your wall, you are going to want to dig around 6-7 inches below the surface to allow enough depth for the gravel base for the wall. Also the trench should be roughly 14-16 inches wide. 5. Tip: When digging the trench try to keep it as flat and level as possible, so when building the base it will be easier to keep that level and flat as well. 6. Make the base. Using gravel to fill the trench slowly and packing it in stages to build up the base. You are going to want to make the base around 4-6 inches, depending the height of your wall. Also you want to make sure that you base is wide enough that your block will sit completely on the base. Also make sure the base block is at least one inch below the surface to ensure the gravel base wont wash out underneath. 7. Tip: Using a motorized plate packer will ensure a solid base. You can also use a hand packer, which would be cheaper, but not as efficient. Using a string line can help ensure a straight wall when laying the base block. 8. Set the base block. Now that you have the base set and level as close as possible, you can now set your base row of the wall. This is going to be the most time consuming and most important step of the building process. The tools needed to do this task would be a rubber mallet and 12 inch level. When setting the base block you want to make sure that it is level from front and back and side to side. Also when joining the blocks, you want to make sure they line up and are flues with each other. 9. Tip: If the base row is not level and flush with each other, it will throw off the entire wall and you will notice that after a couple additional rows. 10. Build up the wall. Now is the simple task of adding the rows and the only thing to keep a close eye on is making sure the blocks line up or make a smooth bend. You can do this by looking down the wall to see if they all line up. 11. Tip: If making a bend in the wall you may have to chip off some of the knob on the bottom in order to make the bend. This is a judgment part and a little trial and error. 12. Fill the cavity of the wall with rock. As you slowly build the wall up, you will want to fill the cavity with river rock or other medium sized rock to help will filtering the water and mud when it rains. This will also help with the back fill behind the wall instead of hauling lots of dirt in. 13. Cap off the wall. Now take the wall caps and glue them to finish off the wall. You will want the cap to over hang about an inch over the final row or about the length from the tip of you index finger to that first line or bend of the finger. You may need to cut the cap with a cement saw to make the bend. 14. Back fill and clean area. Back fill behind the wall up to the top of the cap or just below it.	.

Take a nap, yourself, the day before. You cannot be tired out for the next step, neither can you have other kids untired. 2. After your meal before sunrise, pray fajr and pretend to sleep.( If you have your own room you can skip this part) Then when everybody is asleep, get up and enjoy the peace and quiet. Don't feel guilty as if you're shutting out your siblings, it's not even affecting them. Relax before things get too bothersome. 3. Never NEVER admit to being annoyed. 4. Start talking to your siblings if they come up to you. Act very enthusiastic so they can't change the subject. Later they'll get bored and go off. Try this when you're in a good mood, you'll need patience. 5. Be emphathetic;your brothers and sisters are fasting too. For an older brother, steer clear. They will look for every chance to annoy you and say you can't get angry, because it's Ramadan( they can't help it. They're brothers).For an older sister, she might sometimes be bossy, so diligently do what she says once so she doesn't get mad. Then make a beeline for the nearest getaway. 6. Be real sure to take a prep nap for tomorrow. 7. For younger kids, it might be their first time. Offer to read a story or something to get food off the mind (you'll also be saving your parents and other siblings- what a good deed!).If the little ones don't fast, they may not understand why they can't eat in front of you. So put them in the kitchen,tell them to finish, and leave. 8.	Sure, you're thinking, GREAT way to get my mind off food. But really, knowing that you helped with food while fasting, will make you feel stronger than your siblings so you feel really good.

Then close the top of the reservoir area. * The amount of vinegar you should use does vary depending on your specific Keurig Mini machine. In most cases, it will take about a cup of liquid to fill the machine to the fill line. * You can also use a commercial product called the Keurig Descaling Solution. However, using plain, white vinegar is more cost effective and it generally works just as well. 3. Start the brew cycle on the machine. First you will need to turn on the machine. Then open and close the cup area.	"Opening and closing the cup area will trick the machine into thinking that you have inserted a K-cup into the cup holder. Once you hit ""brew,"" the machine will begin heating and pushing the vinegar through the machine."

Exercise regularly. Not only does regular exercise reduce the likelihood for heart disease and other illnesses, it has also been shown to treat both depression and anxiety. There are various explanations for why this occurs. First, exercise releases endorphins, a feel-good chemical in the brain that improves mood. It also reduces certain immune system chemicals that cause depression, and raises the body temperature, which promotes relaxation. * Regular exercise also helps you get in shape and improve your overall appearance, which for many people, is enough to rid them of their self-doubt. * Endorphins help to inhibit your body’s stress response, which lowers your risk for feeling anxious or developing symptoms of panic throughout the day. * Some studies show that exercise helps to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety just as well as medication. Even just 10 minutes of physical exercise can help alleviate anxiety and depression symptoms as much as a 45 minute workout. * Exercise can lower your baseline anxiety, or the level of tension or anxiety you experience daily.	.

After a half an hour, the temperature should be reduced to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (170 degrees Celsius) to finish cooking. 2. The tray the turkey is roasted in should be covered thoroughly with two sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil. One sheet should go length-wise and the next sheet the other way.	This keeps in moisture, and doesn't allow the turkey to burn or dry out.

Decide how many people you need to cook for. Often backpackers will cook for themselves even when going out in a group. However occasionally you may want to get in on the communal cooking experience.What do you prefer?Two's a crowd = You are a Solo Cooker who occasionally doesn't mind sharing a meal with a friend. It's okay your friend feels the same about not sharing.Let's all Share = You like the idea of cooking for a group of 3 or more, and aren't afraid to pack the gigantor cooking pot to match. 3. Down to business - 5 types of mainstream Backpacking Stoves. Canister Stoves, White Gas (liquid fuel) Stoves, Alcohol Stoves, Wood Burning Stoves, & Esbit Stoves 4. Canister Stoves- One of the most commonly recognized being the JetBoil™ stove systems. These bad boys typically run on pressurized canisters of butane and burn hot and fast. Boils 2 cups in around 2-3 minutes. Will burn at almost any altitude, in most any weather. And they are a plug & play set-up for the most part. Hook up the canister, light the stove and away you go. But you will pay the price in weight and literally with your wallet ( not just for the stove, but for the fuel as well). these expensive stove systems weigh a little under a 1lb not including the weight of the fuel canister which can be an additional 1lb of weight. 2 lbs of weight has you set solidly in the regular backpacker category perhaps nearing the climbing everest category depending on how you assemble your pack. Plenty of power for group cooking. 5. White Gas (liquid fuel) Stoves - Commonly recognized model is the MSR WhisperLite™. These stoves are pretty similar to the canister stoves except they typically burn whitegas. and are sometimes not as expensive as the canister stoves, but not always. The benefits of white gas is that it's cheap, and has a lot of energy. But is also a little more finicky of a stove system. You may have parts you need to keep clean when you store your fuel bottle that hooks into the stove. You also have to pump up the fuel bottle to pressurize it before use, and if you have any spills in your pack because you forgot to screw the lid on tight you'll end up smelling like a gas station, and have stained gear where the fuel has leaked. Boil times are competitive with the canister stoves at about 2:30 - 4:00 minutes per 2 cups. But once again the weight price ends up being about the same as the canister stoves at about 1lb not including fuel. But you will typically always have enough fire to take care of all your cooking needs. You are still a regular backpacker possibly climbing Everest but if you're lucky you could be considered a Kind-Of-Light Backpacker. Plenty of power for group cooking. 6. Alcohol Stoves - Waaahooo!!! Now you are talking about getting into the realm of true Ultra-Light Backpacking. No more wheezing noises coming down the trail because you are shouldering a pack that weighs what a marine would carry for war.	that being said typically inexpensive and reliable. Alcohol stoves are the zenith of efficiency, weight, and speed for backpacking stove solutions. My personal favorite comes from www.KeyholeStoves.com, called the Keyhole Stove Mark I™. Boils 2 cups in about 4:30 minutes. Weighs a mere 1.5 oz, and fuel + bottle weight can be as light as 4 oz for a 2-3 day trip. You will be hard pressed to find a stove type that burns as hot, and as long for such little weight. Drawbacks... Sorry that's a hard one for these guys. Unless you are climbing tall mountains, or doing some hardcore cold weather packing... There just doesn't seem to be much of any. The fuel is safe to carry if it spills typically will not leave stains and completely evaporates so no smell is left behind. Plus you have so many different fuel choices you can burn in your stove that can be found at many different stores. Burn Liquid Heet from your auto-parts store, Denatured Alcohol (My Personal Favorite) from the hardware store, or 91% Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol from the pharmacy. Plenty of power for group cooking, just make sure your stove you buy is sturdy enough to handle the amount of weight you want to put on it.

Ask your doctor about using medications for symptom relief. One commonly prescribed medication is glyceryl trinitrate. It causes your blood vessels to relax and widen. This increases the blood flow to your heart immediately and should relieve your pain within three minutes. * This medication is taken to stop an angina episode or prevent it if you are about to do something that may trigger it, like exercise. * It may cause headaches, flushing, and dizziness. You should not drink alcohol with it. If it makes you dizzy you should not drive or operate machinery. * You can take it as a pill or a spray. 2. Use medications to prevent future episodes. There are many different possibilities for medications that your doctor may prescribe, depending on your symptoms and medical history. These medications are designed to prevent attacks over the long-term, rather than deal with an occurring or oncoming attack. Because some of these medications may interact with other prescription medicines, over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, or supplements, it is important to tell your doctor about everything that you take. Possible medicines include: * Beta-blockers. These medications make your heart beat slower and weaker, reducing the amount of blood and oxygen it requires. Side effects include fatigue, cold hands and feet, diarrhea, and feeling unwell. These medications may interact with other medications, including over-the-counter medications. * Calcium channel blockers. These medications relax your arteries and increase the blood flow to your heart. Side effects include flushing, headaches, dizziness, exhaustion, and rashes, but they usually stop after a few days. Grape fruit juice can cause you blood pressure to drop, so you should never drink grape fruit juice while on these medications. * Long-acting nitrates. These medications relax your blood vessels and increase the blood flow to your heart. Side effects include headaches and flushing. These medications cannot be taken with sildenafil (Viagra) because they may lower your blood pressure too much. * Ivabradine. This medication slows your heartbeat. It is often given to people who cannot take beta-blockers. A side effect is that it may disturb your vision by causing you to see bright flashes. This can make driving at night dangerous. * Nocorandil. This medication widens your coronary arteries and increases blood flow to your heart. They are often prescribed for people who can’t take calcium channel blockers. Side effects include dizziness, headaches, and feeling unwell. * Ranolazine. This medication relaxes the heart without affecting the rhythm of your heart beat. It is often given to people with heart failure or arrhythmias. Side effects include constipation, dizziness, and weakness. 3. Use medications to reduce your risks of heart attacks and strokes. People with angina are often at a high risk for a heart attack or stroke. If this is the case for you, your doctor may suggest the following medications: * Statins. These medications prevent your body from making cholesterol. This can reduce your blood cholesterol, prevent additional blockages in your arteries, and reduce your risk of heart attacks and strokes. Side effects include constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. * Aspirin. Aspirin can prevent the platelets in your blood from sticking together and forming clots. This reduces your risk of heart attacks and strokes. Aspirin may not be suitable for people with stomach ulcers. Side effects include irritation to your digestive tract, indigestion, and feeling unwell. * Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE). These medications lower your blood pressure. This means that your heart doesn’t have to work as hard.	Side effects include dizziness, exhaustion, weakness, and coughing.

Hire expert witnesses. To help the jury understand what medical care should have been given, the plaintiff will likely present one or more expert witnesses. These experts are often doctors who can be hired to testify on the plaintiff’s behalf. If the plaintiff has an expert, then you will need an expert as well. * Your expert will testify as to whether you acted in a reasonably competent manner and whether your actions caused harm to the baby. * Your lawyer should be familiar with experts who are willing to testify for the defense. Some experts only testify for plaintiffs and some only testify for defendants. 2. Select jurors. This is a key part of the case. You will want to screen out prospective jurors who you think would be biased against you at trial. During “voir dire,” the judge will ask the jurors questions. You can often give the judge questions to ask (or ask them yourself). * In addition to striking prospective jurors for bias, you should also be given a number of “peremptory challenges.” With a peremptory challenge, you can exclude a juror without having to give a reason. * To uncover bias, you should try to find out whether the juror has brought a medical malpractice lawsuit before and whether or not the juror ever experienced complications during delivery. A juror who had might not be sympathetic to your case. 3. Have your lawyer present an opening statement. A birth injury trial will begin with opening statements. Your lawyer will tell the jury what evidence you will present and what the evidence will prove. The best way to think of the opening statement is that it operates as a roadmap for the jurors, laying out what evidence will be presented. 4. Cross-examine witnesses. The plaintiff will present their case first. Typically, the witnesses will include the birth mother, the baby’s doctor, and expert witnesses who can testify as to what a reasonable doctor or medical professional would have done during the delivery. * Your lawyer will then cross-examine these witnesses. The purpose is to undermine the jury’s confidence in the witness’s testimony. * Because this is a birth injury lawsuit, your lawyer will handle the birth mother sensitively. In fact, your attorney might not even ask her any questions. * However, your attorney should be more aggressive when cross-examining any expert. Specifically, your lawyer will try to impeach the expert, perhaps by confronting the expert with a publication in which the expert expressed different opinions than those expressed at trial. 5. Testify on your own behalf. As the defendant, you will probably have to testify about what actions you took during the delivery. Your lawyer should help you prepare by doing one or more practice sessions. Remember the following tips when you testify: * Always look attentively at the attorney questioning you.	.

Self hypnosis can help you reach your personal goals in any arena of life. Even when you think you are ready to give up, self hypnosis can help get you back on task and on target. Self hypnosis is one of the easiest, most affordable techniques that you can use to change your life for the better. Unlike some therapeutic or self help programs that require many complex steps before you see any results, self hypnosis can start to have an effect on your attitude almost immediately. When you welcome self hypnosis into your life, you welcome a whole new beginning. 2. All too often we feel discouraged about our chances of fulfilling our dreams. If you have been trying to achieve a certain end for a long time, it can feel like you have run out of the kinds of ideas and tactics, or simply the motivation to continue working towards your objective. Self hypnosis can help you over any number of hurdles that may be standing in your path. If you’ve only just started imagining what it would be like to reach a personal goal like losing thirty pounds, having more energy, quitting smoking, earning more money at work, or finding love that will last a lifetime, it can be tough to know how to get started. Self hypnosis can help you at every step along the way. 3. Making a lasting or profound change through self hypnosis takes time and dedication. To get the best results from a program of self hypnosis, you will want to devote at least fifteen minutes of your time per day for a few months.	Self hypnosis teaches you to achieve a kind of deep physical relaxation and psychological openness. At the end of your fifteen or twenty minute practice session, you return to a normal state feeling replenished and wonderful. The deeper results of self hypnosis can take weeks or even months to emerge, but as soon as you start a self hypnosis program you will be improving your quality of life. Every time you finish even a brief self hypnosis session, you will feel as though your day has started anew, and that you have more energy and positive feelings to apply to every task in your path.

Giving them a basic clean immediately after spills (as well as part of your regular car-washing routine) will help prevent them from growing permanent. For stubborn stains and/or spills from specific substances, you may need to switch from your basic cleaning solution to a more specific product to deal with each one.	.

Take into account who will be using the sofa. Before you choose a color for your sofa, consider the other members of your family. If you have a roommate, children, or even a pet, you may want to go with a neutral dark or medium color like gray to hide potential stains. For example, small children are prone to making messes, and the last thing you want is to come home to a light colored couch covered in dirt and food residue. Similarly, pets like dogs and cats are likely to shed so you may want to match the color to their fur. This will spare you both constant worry and cleaning. 2. Look at the overall motif of the room. Is the room you’re placing the sofa in for relaxation, entertaining, or simply for show? If there is a set purpose or theme to the room, you will want the color of the couch to reflect this.	However, if the room is for show, you may want to make more of a statement with a bright red or deep purple.

Dissolve limescale buildup. Avoid using commercial products that have anti-limescale ingredients since they could leave the enamel looking dull. Instead, remove the chalky buildup by mixing together equal parts of white vinegar and water. Dip a soft cloth into the diluted vinegar and rub it on the limescale until it dissolves. Rinse the area and dry it immediately. * Avoid rubbing the diluted vinegar over other parts of the tub that don't have limescale since this could damage it. 2. Apply diluted chlorine bleach to stains. For most stains, mix together 1/2 cup (120 ml) of chlorine bleach and 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Dip a cloth in the solution and rub it over the stain. You can also spray the solution directly on the stain. Let the bleach solution sit for 1 to 2 minutes and then rinse it off. Dry the tub once the stain is removed. 3. Soak away stains with a cleansing paste. If you have tougher stains that don't disappear after using the bleach solution, make a gentle cleaning paste. Mix together 1 part hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts cream of tartar. Spread this paste over the stains and let it sit for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Use a soft cloth to wipe away the paste and then rinse the area. Dry it if the stains are gone. * If the stains aren't gone, you can repeat the treatment until they disappear. 4. Rub a sliced lemon over rust stains. Slice a fresh lemon in half and rub it directly onto rust stains. Keep rubbing the lemon until you see the stains lift and disappear. Rinse the tub and dry it immediately. *	.

Visit the vet. A veterinarian will be able to confirm whether or not your cat has a buildup of plaque or tartar. Plaque can be cleaned away by brushing, but eliminating the buildup of tartar requires the use of special tools and can only be done in a vet’s office. Also, your vet can assess the overall oral health of your cat and should be able to tell you if it is safe to brush the animal’s teeth. * Your vet should also be able to recommend oral health care products that will be safe and effective for your cat. 2. Purchase your supplies. Your basic supplies will include a soft bristled pet toothbrush and a pet-safe toothpaste. You can’t use human toothpaste on a cat as the fluoride in the toothpaste is toxic to them.	You will also need a cat toothbrush; these will either be a fingertip type (one you slip over your fingertip) or one that looks like a child-sized toothbrush specifically designed for a cat’s mouth.

Treat them to a meal at their favorite restaurant, take them to the cinema to see the movie they've been dying to watch. Enjoy your time together and make them realize how much ""they'll"" miss ""you""! 3. Expressing emotion on the day of their departure is fine. However, don't make them feel guilty for leaving. If they think you're upset with them, they'll worry about you and won't be able to enjoy their trip. 4. Distract yourself after they leave.

You may want to also provide a copy to your partner or any individuals living in your home with you. You can also give a copy to your emergency contact so she has instructions on what to do in the event of an emergency due to your asthma. * If you are preparing an Asthma Action Plan for your child, provide a copy of the action plan to anyone who cares for your child, from grandparents to babysitters, as well as to the school nurse and your child’s teachers and coaches. 2. Adjust your AAP based on your symptoms and your treatment. You should review your action plan during every doctor’s visit to ensure the plan is up to date with your asthma symptoms and your asthma treatment. If there are changes made to your asthma treatment, such as new medications, or if you develop another asthma trigger, add it to the action plan. Keeping the action plan as current as possible will ensure it is effective and relative to your condition. * Reviewing the action plan with your doctor regularly will also ensure you are taking the right dosage of your medication and your action plan is reflective of your doctor’s instructions. 3. Talk to your doctor if you are using the AAP, but your asthma is not under control. You may require a treatment change if your asthma gets worse despite the use of an action plan.	.

To help ease your throat, try drinking the water warm. * Add honey to your water, which can help fight some infections. Also put lemon in the water for a source of Vitamin C. 2. Eat small, nutritious meals. Eat frequent small meals of solid, easily digestible food. This provides a constant supply of energy which aids your immune system. You want your food’s nutrition to help you immune system, not provide energy for activities. * Make sure to limit the amount of activity you do. Even if your energy level rises due to the food, rest. 3. Eat protein. To help boost your immunity, add quality proteins to your meals, like fish and skinless poultry. Eggs are also a great source of protein. This is why people often eat chicken soup when they get sick because the chicken gives you protein. * Also add other nutrient-rich ingredients to the soup, such as brown rice and vegetables. It is believed that chicken soup helps reduce the production of mucus and boosts the immune system. *	The eggs not only provide protein, but also contain zinc, which can help boost the immune system. Eggs are also easily digestible. Try adding spinach or mushrooms, which contain important nutrients. Add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the omelet to help break up the mucus and increase drainage.

Measure the width, height, and length of your room and make a floor plan on a piece of paper. Figure out exactly which pieces of furniture you want to keep, and which you want to get rid of. ""Getting rid of"" doesn't necessarily mean throwing away, though. You can sell it or give it to charity. Remember the fact that furniture can be painted and/or restored. 2. On the floor plan, decide the pieces of furniture that you will want: for example, everyone needs a bed. But what kind of bed do you want? A king, queen, double, twin? A canopy, box, daybed, sleeper, trundlebed, bunkbed, loftbed, what? If you have guests over frequently, you may want to get a couch. If you have lots of books, a bookcase may be necessary. If you like to use your room as a place to do homework, you may want to consider a desk. The list goes on and on. Figure out what storage you need and what kind you want. Don't select anything that's too big or oversized. If you have 10 CDs, but see a cool 500-CD shelf, don't buy it. It'll just look empty and plain and take up additional space."	Draw all these out onto your floor-plan and remember to use a realistic scale. (In other words, make sure everything fits.) Pieces of furniture may include: a bed, a couch, a desk, a vanity, a bookcase, a dresser, a nightstand, etc. If you don't have room for all of this, don't worry. Just focus on the main pieces of furniture for now. We'll worry about decorating later. Draw these onto your floor plan in exactly the same layout you want.

Sort through the pile and remove any dead leaves or grass. Rinse the chicory leaves again, then allow any excess water to drain. * You can also sort through the leaves to pick out debris as you’re rinsing them. * You can use this same process to remove bitterness from chicory root. Scrub the root clean with a vegetable brush. 2. Boil the leaves for about two minutes. Bring a pot of water to a boil over medium to high heat. Drop the leaves in the boiling water and allow them to cook. Use a sieve to pour out and discard the water, keeping the leaves. * If you don’t mind some bitterness, you may prefer to stop cooking the leaves after this first boil. * Chicory leaves are the least bitter in early spring, and increase in bitterness throughout the growing season. They will be more bitter if the growing conditions are poor. * Chicory leaves that haven’t been blanched are more bitter, so to remove bitterness completely you’ll want to boil them three times.	.

Reconnect with your childhood. One way to rekindle the relationship with your inner child is to ""time travel"" back to your childhood. Do this by making a list of things that brought you joy when you were young. Explore these memories and try to recall that childhood wonder. Revisiting these activities is also a good idea. Some ideas: * Sports, whether that's soccer, kickball, football, basketball, baseball, or something else. * Exploring the woods. A picnic is a great idea. * Playing pretend. This can be dressing up and having a tea party or fighting off a band of pirates. 2. Identify your specific inner child. If the relationship with your inner child has dwindled over the years, try to identify what stage of development your child is in now. This will help you create a road map for bringing your inner child back into your life. Some examples are: * The abandoned child. This inner child often comes about as a result of parents divorcing or being too busy to spare attention. Some of the clues are fears of being abandoned and feeling lonely or insecure. * The playful child. This child is a healthy, often neglected aspect of adulthood. The playful child wants to have spontaneous fun and live free from guilt or anxiety. * The fearful child. This child probably received a lot of criticism as a child and experiences anxiety whenever it doesn't get enough affirmation. 3. Write a letter to your inner child. This can be an apology if you feel like you've neglected your inner child and want to repair that connection. It can also be a simple letter expressing your desire to strengthen the friendship. * Tailor your letter to the type of inner child you have. If she is fearful, try to reassure her and soften those fears. If she's worried about being abandoned, let her know that you will do your best to always be there for her. If she is playful, tell her you want to honor that lighthearted freedom. 4. Cultivate an open space. Your inner child is a vulnerable person. She may need a safe space before she shows herself. Many people hide or deny the existence of the inner child because they think it makes them look weak."	Approach her softly, like a small animal whose trust you want to gain.

Turn off the power at the breaker box if you’re working near the wires. Before doing any work that takes place near the wiring of the ceiling fan, go to your breaker box and turn off the switch that sends power to the room you are working in. When you go back to the ceiling fan, try to turn on the fan to make sure the power has been disconnected. * If you aren’t going to be working underneath the ceiling mount of the fan (for example, if you’re just rebalancing the blades on your fan), you don’t need to turn off the power. 2. Rebalance the blades on your ceiling fan. You can purchase an inexpensive balancing kit from your local hardware store for about $20. Place the balancing clip on one fan blade at a time, in-between the base and the tip of the blade.	Once you find the spot that needs to be balanced, peel the adhesive off of one of the balancing weights and place it on top of the blade, directly across from the balancing clip. You can then remove the balancing clip.

Oil the bearings to lubricate the motor. Disassemble the entire fan (make sure the power is off!), and remove the motor from the interior of the fan. Locate the bearings on either side of the motor, and apply 2-3 drops of lubricating oil on each bearing.	Repeat this process on the opposite side of the motor.

Do your history first. It can save a lot of time looking at the history of your local area as that way you will have a fair concept of what to expect, if anything is in your area. If your home has been occupied for many generations, you will likely find a better structure of the history to analyse. Places with little records, or were known to have phases of occupation and desertion can be just as fascinating. * It is important to know the local history or local myths. If your area is said to have history dating back hundreds of years, it can be a far more complex job to correctly identify layers, whereby if you are in a new development, the likelihood of finding old and complex human activity is minimal. In this case, interesting finds or anything you don't understand should be referred to the local museum or archaeological authority. 2. Look in your backyard to scout out earthworks & other signs. Earthworks can be signs of plowing, levelling, terracing or raising the earth to build on. They can also be banks and ditches which can have other interpretations. These changes may have been recent, or much older and may be very subtle. Other useful signs to look for are parch marks or stunted growth in grass or fields. While this can be caused by plant pathology and soil fungus, regular shapes of marks where the soil is dry can be signs of compacted earth and foundations of buildings or other structures (including smaller things such as old bird baths, sundials, ponds and other garden furniture). It can also be natural stone close to the surface, which could be of geological interest. It can also be a sign of chemicals or waste dumping in the past. *	It might be near a river or stream for water supplies, good soil for agriculture, forests for wood and hunting, local hills and valleys that protect from the elements and other aspects. Why you live in your area isn't always the reason why older generations decided to live there

Learn to be comfortable dressing boldly. In order to dress boldly you have to be okay with the idea of people staring at you. People stare at those who look different and bold clothing is a way that people look different. Once you are okay with the idea of people staring at you then you can begin your journey of dressing boldly. It takes time to feel confident in how you look to the point of where you feel fine of people stare at you. Don't rush it, take it slow, you'll get there. 2. Find your style. When dressing boldly you will want to have an idea of what your unique style is. Everyone has their own unique style, whether it is a preference for dresses or pants, blue or green, or sneakers versus sandals everyone has an idea of what they like to wear and figuring that out is a good way to start dressing boldly. Remember dressing boldly doesn't necessarily mean dressing crazily, or wearing things you'd never want to wear. It means having confidence and being courageous when picking outfits and when wearing different looks. 3. Take into consideration what you already have. A lot of the time people think you have to either go out and buy a whole new wardrobe or make new things in order to dress boldly. This however, is not the case. You can dress boldly using what you already have at home. Mixing different patterns, and colors together is an easy way to dress boldly. For example if you happen to own a bright purple shirt instead of matching it with a basic pair of dark colored jeans try opting instead for that pair of bright green pants that you threw in the back of your closet for a more bold, out of the ordinary look. 4. Go through everything. Pick a day that you have some time and go through your closet. Try on all your clothes so you know what fits and what doesn't. Pick out the pieces that don't fit and separate those into a pile that you will get rid of. The pieces that do fit separate those into piles based on the type of clothing. Have a pants pile, a dresses pile, a dress shirt pile, a T-shirt pile, etc. Separating these pieces will make it easier for you to know everything that you own already, so pairing things up will be easier later on. 5. Pair things up. An important step in dressing boldly and getting away with it is to pair things up that are bold but still work together. Anyone can mix random colors and patterns and create an outfit but doing it well to the point where it looks good is a whole other story. When putting together an outfit take into consideration what colors, patterns, and fabrics work well together. Colors such as blue, and orange, green, and red, and purple, and yellow are just a few color combinations that work well together. A color wheel can also be helpful in determining good color combos. You can find one online easily and check out colors using that. Check out primary, and secondary colors. Check out the differences in different color shades. Work this information inot making your outfits. Think also about how different patterns look together. Plaid and stripes usually don't look as great together as plaid and polka dots do if paired together right. There are tons of different patterns in the world so don't be afraid to experiment. Cool patterns include plaid, stripes, polka-dots, and houndstooth.	Leather is super fun to work with and can come in cool colors. Silks, cloth materials, cotton, cashmere, wool, and angora are a few great textures that help dress up a look!

I mean that, when finding what is asked, you certainly get a small amount of pleasure. The pleasure of course is translated differently from man to man but that is what you have to focus on. 2. In order to focus on this exact feeling, you must first be willing to gain happiness from calculus. I can tell from personal experience that at first when I was given a test to do as homework, I used to face the problems in a way that when I was finished with one of them I said : Nice...one out. What I suspect is that you get a similar feeling.	.

First, make sure you know how to draw a manga-style head. You can find some other articles on WikiHow that can help you with this. 2. To draw the hair, make sure you know what you want it to look like. Manga isn't manga unless you make the hair spikey and all! 3. To start out, draw the hair that's in front. Make them curved a little, and draw thin strands - not lines, you do that later - but strands, as in two lines that curve alongside each other and finally meet at the end. Don't make it too thick, and don't put too much. Usually 5-6 is enough.	Draw as many as you want, until you are satisfied. If you are doing bangs, then you can just use lines that curve. Make them a little squished together - you don't want bald spots!

"""""""""""""""	<delete><Therefore><1>|||<delete><,><2>	True	Healing Yourself So You Can Forgive  1. Acknowledge your emotions. If you’re sad, ashamed, or angry about being betrayed, that is perfectly natural. Don’t feel bad if you experience these emotions. Instead, find positive ways to deal with these feelings. Accepting how you feel is an important step toward emotional recovery, which is the first step toward forgivness. * You might also feel resentment, contempt, and disgust at the person who betrayed you. 2. Write a letter to the person who betrayed you. Writing a letter is therapeutic because it allows you to express yourself in an honest, thoughtful way. You don’t need to send the letter, though you could. Alternately, you could choose to burn the letter afterwards in order to help you exorcise the negative feelings the letter contained. Writing a letter can provide emotional healing for you, moving you further along in the process of forgiveness. 3. Talk to a trusted friend or family member about the betrayal. Getting support from those who care about and love you is an important step in recovering emotionally after a betrayal. Explain the betrayal to your friend or family member. Once you’ve talked through the betrayal with someone, you’ll feel better, and be more willing to forgive. * You could also talk to someone you trust about methods they used to help forgive someone who betrayed them. * If you do not feel comfortable talking to someone within your social circle, you could consult a therapist. Therapists are trained in helping people deal with conflicted, painful feelings, including how to cope with betrayal. 4. Recover a sense of power. When you’re betrayed, you might feel an intense pain and sense of powerlessness. To restore a sense of power to your life, you need to think of yourself as someone who does things, rather than as someone who endures or suffers from things done to them at the hands of someone who has betrayed you. Unless you feel a sense of autonomy in your own life, you will be unable to forgive anyone else or heal fully from the betrayal. * Use positive self-talk to reclaim power in your life. * For instance, say to yourself, “I value myself and others. Others value and love me in return.	.

Diving for abalone is one of a kind enjoyed by many on the north coast of California. Using scuba tanks or any other underwater breathing apparatus is not used and all the fun lies when you must get them by diving while holding your breath. Not to say that you can’t go out at very a low tides and “rock pick” them without entering the water, but this article is about diving for them, which is one of the the basic method of catching them. 2. First of all, an abalone is a huge snail that lives on the rocks in the shallows of the ocean. Although there are several types, the one sought after here in northern California is a Red Abalone. This abalone usually is 7 inches across the shell at any point in order to be “legal” under California law and rarely grows to over 11 inches in its life. The typical one taken by the sport diver will be between 7 and 9 inches. By law, every diver must carry their own measuring device while diving which are wide “U shaped” tools with an inside width of 7 inches. The abalone are firmly attached to the rocks by their “foot” and are pried off with a flat bar, which also must meet certain criteria legally to avoid damage to undersized abalone and those that are unable to be pried off such as, It must not be sharp or not wide enough so the abalone are not cut with it. Every diver should read and familiarize themselves with the regulations each year for taking abalone, as the regulations change from time to time and violation of the rules usually result in fines of at least $1500 and can also result in a jail-time and the confiscation of your diving equipment due to the protected status of these creatures. For instance, every abalone taken must be logged properly both on a tag and on the report card immediately upon exiting the ocean, without exception. At this time, you may possess only three abalone at one time, no matter if they are in your freezer at home or in your dive bag at the ocean, and you may take only 24 in any one year. You may not obtain another diver’s abalone and hand them to him or her when in the ocean or “trade up” for larger ones after you have removed a legal one from the rocks. Again, other regulations apply so it is important that you read the regulations prior to the diving. 3. The water on the north coast of California is cold.	The other gear that you will need would be a mask, snorkel, fins, weight belt, abalone bar, abalone gage, and something to keep your abalone in as they must be kept separate from other divers’. I highly recommend that each diver have and use a “dive tube” to keep their abalone in as this also doubles as an indispensable safety device, if needed. Sea sickness, cramps, exhaustion, and injuries do occur and such a floatation device can save your life. It also can offer a place to float and rest or just to float and shoot the breeze with your friends and enjoy the views. The dive tube also has the added feature of having shoulder straps so it can be used as a backpack for your gear when hiking to and from the ocean. The bag is basically a canvas covering with a zipper that encloses the inner tube of a car. It has rings attached to it so you can tie things to it such as your measuring device, fish bags if you are a spear fisher as well, and clips to hold your spear gun when not in use. I highly recommend using a separate bag for your fish or sea urchins as the sharp fins and quills will puncture your tube and they are not cheap.

See which of the items on your first list can serve for purposes of the other two. A bed with a bland cover and the right pillows along the back can be a couch. 3. ) Now start searching. Don't try to buy everything at once. If you snatch the first stick of furniture you find, you pay more than if you wait and look for bargains. When you buy or find any items, think beyond their immediate appearance. You can always paint or alter them. Paint a hideous ecru dresser white and add rococo touches. 4. ) First, consider free furniture. Look on Yahoo Groups for a group called freecycle. Find one that serves a place near you ex. Michigan freecycle. Freecycle is a group that uses Email to hook up people who want to give or get something for free. THERE IS ALSO THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE -FREECYCLE.ORG. Look on Craigslist.com. If you open your local craigslist under ""for sale"" you can find a subcategory ""free."" This is a great place to find freebees."	Again, with these three entries, think of the long term. College kids leave stuff at the end of a school year, and other people may throw out perfectly good furniture when they buy new furniture.

See a doctor as soon as you can. Getting to a doctor (or an appropriately trained medical professional) quickly is important when dealing with a dislocated shoulder because when the muscles, tendons and ligaments around the injury tighten up, the head of the humerus becomes very difficult to relocate without surgical intervention. Most doctors will likely want to x-ray your shoulder area before doing anything else in order to rule out a fracture.center * If nothing is broken or badly torn, then the doctor can perform a closed reduction maneuver on the shoulder joint, although you may need a sedative, strong muscle relaxant or general anesthetic before the physical manipulation can be done due to the severe pain. * A common reduction method for the shoulder joint is called the Hennepin maneuver, which utilizes external rotation of the shoulder. While laying flat, the doctor will flex your elbow to 90 degrees and gradually rotate your shoulder outward (external rotation).	.

Look inside yourself to find some solid ground. This means seeking to find out what is real, an object of focus or something else you can use as a foundation or point of reference. Even if this means for the moment being aware of how you are standing, sitting, counting breaths, etc., this is a simple but effective way to ground yourself. Find some connection with something you know is real in order to act as a support or a point of reference. 2. Work out the subject and theme of the thought process. Most of the time these thoughts are about ""what's right and what's wrong"", ""should I do this or that"", ""is he/she right or wrong"", ""why do things happen"", and so forth, which is the subject. However the theme might be wanting something to be, or not to be, to come, or go away etc. It is important to be able to recognise exactly what is going on in your thoughts. * Try to distinguish if there is something lacking, or rejection of something, or perhaps just uncertainty going on because you don't know about the topic. Having recognised the subject and theme, you can take a step back if you decide you want nothing to do with it. 3. Aim to not get personally involved with the theme or subject. Tempting though it is, its like a baited hook, once you've bitten it, you're stuck on it. Remember - it's your mind, and you're in control. 4. Consider this analogy. That the vast array of confusing thoughts and varying views, concepts and opinions are collectively like a thicket of vines, a dense jungle, a tangle of wool or wire. They simply are what they are - a tangle, thicket or jungle of views and concepts. You can always see a subject from a different angle, so two (or many) opposing views can be equally valid based on personal experiences, preferences and perceptions. Some issues simply are impossible to resolve and get increasingly complicated and more snagged the deeper you go. * The trap is to start saying one issue is right or one is wrong, because both issues may be right or both wrong. You can't always tell easily. Confusion often remains because we want to be involved with the issue or want to discuss the issue; for the open mind there is no challenge to see things two ways (namely, playing the devil's advocate) because the issue at hand can be seen from two different angles and given different outcomes. It is often because we want something to be right or wrong and set in stone forever, or want to know right or wrong as an absolute that we create the entire problem of our confusion. 5. Separate yourself from the confusing thoughts. You can do this by mentally distinguishing yourself from that thought and then you can see it is a distinct process, one you can abandon like you put down a heavy sack. By trying to destroy it or forcibly crush the thought we are giving it all our attention, which consequently feeds fuel to the fire. 6. Alternative methods you can try are as follows. * Decide if you can actually find out or resolve the facts from the fiction that your mind maybe involved in. Sometimes confusing thoughts arise over trivial subjects, the answers to which can be found online, in books or from specialists (such as healthcare concerns). For those issues that are simply impossible to find out (such as metaphysical or religious based topics), still look into it to gain an insight into if the subject and let go of what has been disproved, or what simply cannot be proved. It may be possible to prove them later in life, or when technology exists that can prove it, but it might simply remain impossible during your lifetime. There is a certain honesty and certainly a strength and dignity in being able accept and let go of what you cannot prove, rather than trying to plug a hole with a theory or wild imaginings, beliefs and fantasy out of fear, anxiety or personal dislikes. * You can't always fix the theme of the problem. If you're worried about something, this can add to the confusion by adding in a thought of: ""Why can't I fix it? Is there something wrong with me?"". This is another baited hook. Try to accept that it might not be possible to fix. * Decide if there is any benefit in the thought process. Do you really want to be confused by your thoughts? Do you really want to think or get involved with the issue? If no, then there is nothing to stop you letting go of that thought chain. * This isn't easy though, but it gets easier the more you do it - if you look at it and say ""I'm not interested in that anymore"", there is no real excuse for the mind to keep on holding it, unless you want it to. As mentioned before: Remember - it's your mind, you're in control. * Try writing the issue down. Doing this may resolve the problem for you. Concentrating attentively and selectively on the issues that really concern you rather than vainly fretting and being ineffectual in your response can be improved by writing down the elements of the issue as you perceive them. Perhaps a list of pros and cons, or perhaps a random list of the things that bother you about the issue. Whatever comes to mind."

Alternatively, to further open your chest and shoulders, you can place the palm on the outside of your foot. * Be sure that your front knee doesn't drop inwards. 5. Hold for one minute.

Spread through the deck and have a spectator select a card. If you've got a lot of decks, have them sign it. Anyway, tell them that the card they chose is a ruthlessly ambitious card that will always jump to the top, but only when he/she snaps his/her fingers. 2. While you are distracting them with the story, perform a Marlo Tilt. When you finish the story, take their card, poke around the middle, and then insert their card above the third card. The angle of the first card makes it appear as if you have inserted their card into the middle of the deck. This is how to perform a Marlo Tilt: * Take the top card and lift up one end, the end closer to you * They shouldn't be able to see it. 3. Ask them to snap their fingers, and perform a double-lift. (A double is a sleight in which you lift two cards instead of one, giving the impression that the second card from the top is actually the top card). You will of course be revealing their card. Then, flip the two cards that seems as one over, and slide the top card into the middle of the deck. This top card is not their card, since their card was second from the top. 4. Ask them to snap their fingers once more, and simply reveal the top card. 5. (Optional Step) If you can perform the pass, riffle your thumb down the side of the deck and tell them to tell you when to stop. Cut the deck where they tell you to stop, but keep a pinkie break on their card. As soon as they look at you, perform the pass and tell them to snap your fingers, followed by the reveal. 6. While they are busy being astonished by the trick from the last step, catch a thumb break (hold your hand palm down with the deck between your fingers, and have the bottom card separated from the one above it by your thumb).	Using the deck in your right hand, flip over the top card of the deck in the left, which is of course, their card. As you flip their card face-down, casually drop the bottom card of the right pile-the card you were holding separate- onto their card.

Look for Animal footprints. Wherever you live there will be animals making their homes nearby or going for a walk. If you take a closer look at the ground, you might detect their footprints. Take your child for an animal hunt. How many signs of animal life can he find? What kinds of animals are living near you? Can you hear animal sounds? Can you tell what animal the foot prints or marks belongs to? While visiting a zoo or a farm, notice special qualities animals have. Can you differentiate a rhinoceros from a hippopotamus? How does the giraffe use its very long neck and what does the elephant use his big trunk for? Seek the cooperation of a zoo keeper or a farmer for questions your children may have that you can’t answer. 2. Watch a Plant Grow. Children enjoy planting seeds and see them grow. It’s like magic for them. But it can be frustrating at times because you don't see anything right away. 3. Look Beyond the Surface. When you look into the water what you see is usually blurred off by light reflections. But there is a fascinating world down under waiting to be discovered. You can make a viewer to help you see through the underwater world. Follow the instructions on how to make a viewer: you need a small plastic bucket, a plastic wrap and an elastic band. First step begins with cutting a big circle at the bottom of the bucket.	Secure the plastic in place with the elastic band. Submerge the top of the bucket (plastic-wrapped end) into the water. Look through the hole in the other end of the bucket to see what's happening under the water. The deeper you go the more view is magnified, but don't put the top of the viewer into water or it will be filled with water. The viewer works best in clear water.

Dress_for_a_Job_Fair.txt	Begin_Revision	0.936	### Selecting a Successful Outfit for Women	99	And if you usually wear heavy eyeshadow or thick foundation , consider toning it down .	### Styling Your Overall Look	185	If you usually wear heavy eyeshadow or thick foundation , consider toning it down .	<delete><And><1>|||<replace><if><2><If><1>	True	Selecting a Successful Outfit for Women  1. Start with a skirt or pant suit. Women have a few more options than men when dressing for a career fair. Both skirt suits and pant suits are a fine choice, so pick whichever you are most comfortable in. For both, however, avoid bright colors and complicated patterns. Instead, consider black, blue, gray, or tan options for a more professional look. A subtle pattern, such as pinstripes or herringbone, can also be acceptable. * If you’re wearing a skirt, the hemline should hit just below or just above the knee. Skirts should fully cover your thighs when you sit and should be no shorter than 2 inches above the knee. * For a slightly more casual option, you can ditch the jacket. A nice blouse paired with a professional skirt or slacks is appropriate for most career fairs. 2. Pick a blouse that complements your skirt or pants. Again, try to stick to conservative colors or subtle patterns to keep the focus on you rather than your clothes. A collared, white button-down shirt is a business casual stand-by, but a simple pattern can help conceal any small stains or crumbs if you’re concerned about spilling during the fair. * Avoid cleavage-baring shirts or anything else that exposes a lot of skin, such as strapless tops or cutouts. Play it safe by opting for necklines no lower than your collarbone. 3. Wear nice but comfortable shoes. Look for flats, loafers, or pumps with heels less than 3 inches. Since you’ll be on your feet for a while, make sure your shoes are comfortable as well as professional and be sure to avoid any shoes that make it difficult to walk. * Do not wear flimsy sandals like flip-flops, especially if they make a noise when you walk. 4. Choose basic, non-flashy jewelry. A clean, classic look is often best for job fairs. Try not to overdo it with multiple rings, bracelets, and necklaces. Instead, consider wearing one small pair of earrings and a simple watch. Many recruiters recommend removing any facial piercings before job fairs. * Wearing one larger piece of jewelry can be okay, especially in more creative or less formal industries. Selecting a statement necklace or a pair of striking earrings can spice up your outfit and help recruiters remember you. Just be sure to balance by minimizing your other accessories. 5. Apply simple makeup for a subtle but polished look. Your job fair makeup should make you look professional and feel confident. If you typically don’t wear a ton of makeup, try using some simple concealer and a coat of mascara.	Your goal should be a neutral but put-together effect that shows the recruiter you take pride in your appearance.

Understand that all friendships should be give-and-take relationships. Sometimes that means the give-and-take is unevenly distributed. It's just a fact of life, and if you want to continue relationships with friends who just don't have much to give at this time, you will need to accept it. Sometimes, it really is all on you - sometimes it's you giving 100% while they give 0%, while other times, it seems to be a more equitable balance of 50/50. That's life, and it's normal. 2. Let them know you welcome all contact with them. Sometimes, friends shy away from calling - they don't want to ""bug you,"" or they think they need a ""reason"" to call and catch up, or to reach out to you. By making sure your voice is welcoming, or that you respond as soon as possible to emails, etc., you will let them know they don't need any reason to make contact; they can call just to talk, and you'll be glad to hear from them. 3. Use humor to lighten the situation when you mention it. Going up to your friend as if you are a jealous lover, yelling at him or her, acting all depressed because you feel left out, etc. will not make your friend leap to call more often. It will make him or her run like the wind - who needs the drama? Instead, affect some sort of goofy accent or use some other method of clearly joking - do not be pointed about it, insulting, petulant, etc. Above all, know when to quit - make a quick joke: ""Oh, Brandon, you never call, you never write - what am I to think? That you don't love me, that's what!"" And then chuckle, say, ""I know you're so busy - but I love to hear from you, I miss you."" And drop it. Don't keep it going, just let it go. j  1. Realize that you may be the ""needier"" friend at a time when your friend needs space. If this is the case, the most successful and best type of friend you can be is an understanding one. If you make repeated attempts to get your buddy to stay in touch, but s/he doesn't, it may be that life's pressures and demands are weighing heavier on your friend than on you. While you may have loads of time and disposable cash, your friend may be struggling financially, or under the load of classes, etc. Rather than burden you with his or her problems, your friend may simply withdraw for a little while, until circumstances ease. Be sensitive to this. It may be a time for you to probe a little (""I'm concerned about you - you've seemed to withdraw for a little bit. Is there a problem I could help with?"") or to respect the unspoken request for distance. Just be open and friendly, letting your friend know that when he/she is ready to make contact, you will be there. 2. Back off. Once you're clear that your friend is not going to reach out or confide in you, but simply seems less into your friendship than you are, back away for the time being. Let your friend struggle through whatever is going on in his or her life without harassment. Let your friend know that you are there and still care for him or her by sending an email every week or two, texting something innocuous, or just calling and leaving a message occasionally. A text like ""R u busy? Call me?"" is fine. But if s/he doesn't answer, let it go - don't follow up. Or leave a message like ""Hey, Jonah, this is Robin. I'm just calling to say hi - we hadn't chatted in a while and I had a few minutes free. I was just hoping to catch up a little. If you get a chance later, give me a call - otherwise, hope everything's okay, and just wanted to let you know I'm thinking of ya. Chat with ya soon."" These are non-predatory, non-threatening attempts at contact, and have a sincere message that you care attached. But the caution here is, once you've called and left one message, let that be enough. 3. Accept reality. Sometimes, distancing himself from you is your friend's way of letting you know that right now, the friendship just is not a priority to him. If it's tremendously important to you that all friendships be maintained daily, weekly, monthly, etc., then this is not the friend for you. Many friendships naturally drift - that is to say that, sometimes, you are very close to this person, and other times, you have no contact. Many friends of very long-standing have had the experience of falling out of touch with one another for years at a time. Eventually, one friend tracks the other one down, reaches out, and BANG! It's as if no time had passed at all - they resume their friendship. Other times, friends simply grow away, develop other interests, and make other friends, and we lose touch with them permanently. The important thing to remember is that, once someone is important to you, it's rare that you would simply stop caring about him or her."	If one no longer volunteers, there's very little the other can do about it. Let your friend go, and treasure what good memories of your friendship you have.

Whilst browsing consider coverage on the bottom as well as support to the bust. If you wish to disguise or conceal the tummy area look for styles with ruching. For overall figure smoothing opt for swimwear with control panels. 2. Choose a colour which flatters your skin tone and a pattern you won't get quickly bored of. Most modern swimwear fabrics stand up to chlorine, sea water and sunscreen well if you rinse them out immediately after use and avoiding wringing them so tightly that the fibres stretch and break. Follow the care instructions - particularly about how to dry them - and you should get a lot of wear out of your purchase.  1. Now the exciting bit! Finding a size and style which supports and flatters your bust. You can find bra sized bikini tops, tankinis and one-pieces. Don't be afraid to try a style which has some light padding - adding volume to your bust may be the last thing you're looking for - but you'd be surprised what a natural, round shape can be achieved with a lightly padded cup. Not sure of your size? You may need to try a few or ask the advice of an assistant. Remember to try over your own briefs for the sake of hygiene and keep the plastic hygiene strip in place. Most bra sized swimwear is underwired, but there are some non-wired styles around too. Some women with larger busts avoid halternecks because the pressure on the back of the neck is too uncomfortable. However, if you have your heart set on a halterneck, look for a style which has a wide, snugly fitted band around the back to provide support instead of the neck. 2.

Associate yourself with black girls who have boyfriends: These girls are confident and love themselves. They definitely would never think that they are not as pretty as a white girl. So, if you want to build that self confidence and feel pretty, start hanging out with them. There are thousands of “ghetto” black girls who have boyfriends, but they act unruly, so don’t associate yourself with them. You are better off going with that pretty black girl at your school who is dating that HOT basketball player and is pretty. Most girls like this are NOT ""ghetto"" but instead come from good families. If you have alot of black friends, and you are always in an atmosphere along with black girls, you will learn to love yourself. 2. Go on the internet and look at pretty black girls: I first started out my life wishing that I was white, had straight hair, and then, aggravated thinking that I was ugly, I decided to see if there was any pretty, beautiful, and stunning black girls. Well, there is! Go look. There are thousands of gorgeous black girls on the internet. Thousands of black girls in YOUR neighborhood. Thousands of black girls at your school. So, start looking at them, and try to copy their looks. These girls know how to ""strut"" their stuff and look gorgeous, and you can too. 3. Take care of your hair: One thing that ALL black girls hate about themselves is the nappy hair they JUST cannot handle. Even though they spray it with mositurizer every morning, it just still looks ugly. At times like these, you wish that you were white and had their soft and silky hair. If you didn't know: you are quite capable of getting gorgeous hair like white people too. If you want long natural black hair, that is NOT a weave, buy tablets that make your hair grow. Go to hairfinity.com and look at some of the testimonies. Also, buy great hair products. Ask store consutants for the best black hair products they have in stock. No matter what the price, buy it! Your hair will really feel the difference. 4. Always moisturize your skin: One of the problems that all black girls face is the ASHY MONSTER! It seems to follow us around everywhere we go and haunt us. Even if we lotion that day, the ashiness still comes around. Think you have a problem? Well, you probably are not using the right skin cream. Use Vaseline, Eucerine, Jergens, and Aveeno. These brands make black skin glow with radiance. And EVERY morning, mositurize your skin! If you don't, you can REALLY tell the difference. 5. Ask your parents who they think is prettier: Sometimes when I think that I am ugly, I always go to my parents for support. They always can make me feel better about myself. So...try it! In the end, you will feel SO much more confident now that somebody thinks that you are gorgeous. But, if you just think that your parents are lying to you, ask a friend. 6. Ask a friend who they think is prettier: If you are still not sure after you ask your parents who is pretteir: a black girl or a white girl, ask a friend and ask them to be honest with you. No matter what, they are going to say that you are pretty. All ""real"" friends couldn't bear to call you ugly. But, who doesn't want that self confidence? 7. Take care of your teeth: So many back girls have nasty yellow teeth. If you want to be beautiful, look for teeth whitening and ALWAYS brush your teeth. Not brushing your teeth can result in gingivitis and gum disease. Also, it looks disgusting. You don't have a natural beauty look anymore when you have yellow teeth. 8. Change your diet: Eat healthy! It will make your skin look stunning and your body will reap the benfits. Your body will look great. Your skin will have a natural glow to it instead of just being dull, your hair will grown longer, and you will look healthy! Who doesn't want to look like that? 9. Get into extracurriculum activites: Doing extracurriculum activites make you feel confident because not alot of people can make it into these activites. In fact, not alot of blakc girls or guys can make it in."	.

"A rebound is when you'd land something and then jump really high like you were trying to something after your first stunt. To rebound, you just punch the ground as hard as you can with your feet after you land your stunt and that's what gets you to rebound. Power hurdles take a little more power and that's why they are called ""power"" hurdles. first you start in standing position with your arms by your sides and then swing your arms up really hard.

Make your little actions work for what you want to do. Start by doing tiny things that steer you in the direction of the habits you want to make. For example, if you want to do yoga daily. Put out your yoga mat every day for four days in a row at the time you would want to do yoga. Soon enough you will find yourself stretching and working out. This technique of breaking down he actions you want to do into tiny pieces that you can accomplish is going to be the fastest way for you to change your habits for the better. Doing these tiny actions consistently will start to lead you into doing the bigger actions. 2. Know the difference between your feelings and what you want. What you want is bigger than your moods. For example, you want to become a good musician so you can heal others through music therapy. However, you may not feel the importance of that goal in the morning when you need to wake up early to practice your instrument before work. Here your feelings are perhaps stubborn and insubordinate, but what you want is still to practice your instrument. * Visualize the thing that you want to be doing. In the moments where your feelings differ from what you want, picture yourself doing the thing you need. Make it harder for you to indulge your fleeting feelings. Think about how you need to get up and get your guitar in your hand. Think about the tea or coffee that you can drink to wake you up. Think about which pieces of music you will play. 3. Wake up when you decided you needed to wake up. You can probably decide best what you need to do the next morning.	Because when you are able to start your day with good momentum, you will find yourself much more able to do the things that you have set out for yourself. The opposite can happen if you do not get up on time.

Give up on working for affirmation from others. Your life does not have to be about pleasing the people who care about you. They may not understand at first, but this is going to be a life investment. They have plenty of time to get used to the idea. It may be easier, at the start, to do things other people want. However, remember that these decisions can only be made by you, and in the long run, working for your own passions will be the most profitable for you. * If you are watching for what other people think of you or want you to do, you will probably end up on a path that is less satisfying for you. Simply because you did not make that path. * You want to consider what you have to give others, but do not confuse what other people want for you with what you want for yourself. For example, when you are going to decide to what major to choose, do not choose the major others suggest unless it is what really excites you. 2. Take ownership over the things you want in your life. If you are concerned about what others might think, realize that if you can own what you do and put real effort and passion into it, others will recognize that eventually.	You will have to make your actions match what you want to be both on a daily basis and year by year.

Become her friend. 3. After you become her friend ask her this 'Hey I like this girl and I don't know if she likes me back. If it was you would you like me back.?' She probably will blush. If she does that means she likes you! If she doesn't the odds aren't so great. Don't ask her this too early in a friendship or it will seem like you are pushing it. 4. If she does blush, ask her out. Make sure you two are alone! Completely and totally alone!! Also try to keep it low key or else you asking her out will spread throughout the whole 5th grade within recess. 5. If she doesn't blush you just have to be okay with being friends and ONLY friends FOREVER. And if she asks why you asked that, don't try to play it off with, ""nothing"" because then she will suspect that you like her. 6. Don't be scared to talk to her. 7. Whatever you do, don't try to make yourself popular. Be yourself, not the person you think she wants you to be. 8. If she tries to change you, back down.

Find your direction with a compass. It can be easy to figure out directions when you have a compass. A compass is a round instrument with all the cardinal directions printed on it. A rotating needle uses the Earth’s magnetic field to determine what direction the compass is facing. But, it’s important to note that when your compass points north, for instance, it’s pointing you in the direction of magnetic north, which is different from true north (the same goes for magnetic south versus true south). As you spin around in different directions, the compass needle will spin as well, indicating which direction you are facing. * A compass will give false readings around metal objects like keys, watches, and belt buckles. The same is true for magnetic objects, such as certain rocks or power lines. 2. Use a global positioning system. A GPS is arguably the easiest way to determine direction or find your way, because these electronic devices use satellites to position your location. A GPS can be used to tell you where you are, give you directions to a specific location, and track your movements. A GPS must be charged and have a working battery to be functional. It should also be initialized before use, so that it orients itself (knows where it is) and downloads the most current and accurate maps. To begin, turn on your GPS, and allow it to load and acquire signal. * Not only will the GPS have a compass you can use to determine which way is east, west, north, or south, but on its map it will also have an arrow that points in the direction you are facing. * Your coordinates will appear at the top of the screen, also giving you your longitude and latitude. * Because a GPS navigates using satellites, tall buildings, large trees, and other geographic structures can interfere with its signal. 3. Turn your cell phone into a navigation device. Most modern smartphones are equipped with a compass, GPS, or both. There are also applications you can download or software you can install to equip your phone with these features. To use the GPS function on your phone, it must be connected to Wi-Fi or your network, and your GPS or location services must be on. * To access these devices, look for apps called “compass,” “maps,” or “navigation.” 4. Calculate direction with an analogue watch and the sun. Because the sun follows the same path in the sky every day, it can be used in conjunction with a non-digital wristwatch to provide an approximate idea of the cardinal directions. In the Northern Hemisphere, point the hour hand on your watch at the sun. South will be halfway between 12 o’clock and the hour hand. In the Southern Hemisphere, align 12 o’clock on the watch with the sun, and the midway point between that and the hour hand will point north. * When you are facing north, east is on your right and west is on your left. When you are facing south, east is on your left and west is on your right. * During daylight saving time, use one o’clock instead of 12 o’clock on the watch. * For this method to work, your watch must be set for the correct time. * Although the sun rises in the general direction of east and sets in the general direction of west, it only rises due east and sets due west on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes (the first day of spring and fall).	When you are facing east, north will be on your left and south will be on your right. When you are facing west, north will be on your right and south will be on your left.

Start close to the neck and work your way outward to the shoulder. * Repeat this three times, allowing the pressure to increase with each pass. * Bring your hands back up next to the neck with the thumbs extended, and make small circles with the thumbs on either side of the backbone just below the collar line. * Continue with the circles up the back of the neck until you reach the hair line. Lower the hands back down and repeat 2 more times. 3. Place your forearms at the sides of the neck and roll them outwards toward the shoulder by rotating at the wrists. Lift your forearms and move them a couple of inches away from the neck and repeat. When you reach the shoulder, come back to center and repeat two more times. 4. Step to one side of your volunteer, placing one hand at the base of your volunteer's neck, and your front hand lightly on your volunteer's forehead (to keep the head from falling forward). With the rear hand, spread the thumb from the fingers and begin to glide your hand up the back of the neck, without putting pressure directly on the vertebrae. Once you reach the hair line, remain there for a moment with light pressure on the back of the head. Lower your rear hand and repeat from the base of the neck. You can even add some circling to the upward stroke if there seems to be a lot of tension present. Repeat this about 5 times. When your rear hand reaches the hairline for the last time, let it remain there.  5. Slowly allow the head to tilt forward without strain or effort.	Repeat this 3 times, forward and backward.

These may include: fast food, salad dressings or condiments, candy, and any other foods you think might not be 100% good for you. * Follow the food pyramid to ensure your food intake portions are right. * Stay away from a few big meals and try to have several smaller meals or snacks. * When you feel full, stop eating. 6.

Also, some vegetables like peas and corn, also have starch qualities. * Nuts are better than potato chips. They both have a lot of fat but nuts have the healthier kind of fat. * Fruit is better than fruit juice. As I mentioned earlier, juice might have extra sugars, while fruit keeps your digestive system running. * When deciding what milk type of milk to get, try to go with 1% or skim milk. * Don`t eat too quickly. Eating slowly allows your digestive system to function properly. Besides, then you can savor the taste. * Chewing gum is a good thing not only if you are trying to stop smoking, but also if your mouth is bored but your full. Don`t chew gum for over an hour at a time or your jaw may start hurting. * Run for time instead of distance. When you work out your metabolism keeps running faster than normal, even after your workout.	.

Get_a_Job_with_a_Bachelor's_Degree_in_Psychology.txt	Begin_Revision	0.895	### Deciding Which Jobs to Seek	601	So many undergraduate psychology projects involve working with others .	### Matching Your Skills to a Job	663	Many undergraduate psychology projects involve working with others .	<delete><So><1>|||<replace><many><2><Many><1>	True	Deciding Which Jobs to Seek  1. Think about what you want. Employers look for employees who are passionate about their work. You have a better chance of landing a job if you're doing what you want. Think about the kind of work you enjoyed during college, both in and out of the classroom, and ask yourself how that could translate to a professional career. * Think about the traits you exhibit, the interests you have, and the kind of environment you want to work in. These factors can help you find the best job for you. * For example, if you're naturally empathetic and outgoing and love helping others, look for jobs related to counseling. You could be something like a guidance counselor, a parole officer, or work as an assistant to a professional therapist or social worker. 2. Look into your experience with research. You probably have an edge over the competition when it comes to research jobs as a psychology major. If you turned in a thesis, you likely did rigorous research involving a variety of case studies, data analysis, and statistical analysis. Write down all your research experience and keep your eyes peeled for job postings seeking your specific research skills. 3. Assess your interpersonal communication skills. Many psychology majors are interested in the hands-on aspects of the field that involves working with others. If this was the case for you, this can work to your advantage on the job hunt. Think about ways you developed your interpersonal communication skills as a psychology major and jot down your specific skills. * Think about internships and volunteer experiences. Psychology majors often have intern or volunteer experience related to interpersonal communication. For example, maybe you worked at a crisis hotline over the summers. * Research often requires communication. If you conducted interviews during your senior thesis, this is great to include on your resume. 4. Think about your writing skills. A lot of people fail to recognize the speaking and writing skills that go into getting a psychology degree. As many job posting call for excellent written communication skills, find a way to highlight how your psychology degree helped you develop that skill set. You probably had to write a lot as a psychology major. Research papers and reports are a major part of the degree path. * If you did any professional writing during your internship or volunteer experience, jot this down. This experience can be noted on a resume later. For example, if you had to summarize case studies as part of a research assistantship, this can really showcase written communication skills. 5. Focus on your experiences with teamwork. Many jobs look for candidates who know how to work on a team.	Research conducted in the field of psychology also involves a heavy amount of teamwork. Write down any experiences you had working as a team as an undergraduate. Later, you may need to include this information on a resume.

Write a resume that includes relevant experience. When writing your resume, tailor it to the job you want. Do not simply include all your work experience on a resume. Think about the job you're looking for and highlight your most relevant work. * Say you're applying primarily to research positions. Place primary focus on things like research jobs, coursework that involved research, studies you conducted, and any publications you have. * You can include things that are not directly related, but place them lower down on the page.

Wether it be by giving her a little smile when you walk past\near her, or looking her directly in the eye. Note, to a metal chick, there's nothing more attractive and eyecatching than a guy with beautiful long hair breaking down and windmilling! Don't be afraid to be a bit of a show-off! 3. Approach her. Assuming it's your first time talking, keep things simple like complimenting her shirt, if it's repping a band you like. Know that this could spark a whole new conversation about music. And remember, be a sweetheart. If you're not down for that, then forget it. 4. If things went well with that first conversation, try it again sometime. Remember to be friendly, humorous, and humble.	If you somehow end up in a headbanging competition, don't let her win just to be a gentleman! If she beats you anyway, hell, that's your own problem.

Obtain the proper garnishing tools. Most garnishes can be made with a paring knife, but it is helpful to have a channel knife tool and a grater. A larger knife may be needed if larger fruits are to be prepared, such as oranges and pineapples. Channel knife tools are used to make twists and spirals from citrus fruits, while a grater enables one to grate ingredients such as chocolate and nutmeg fresh right over the cocktail. A grater can also be used to grate ingredients that are used for rimming glasses. A combination of different garnishes can be used, so have the tools ready for the types of garnishes that are to be made. 2. Decide what kinds of garnishes should be used. The cocktail recipe will usually call for a certain garnish, but this is not always the case. Different garnishes can be used according to personal preference, and combinations of multiple garnishes can be used. Citrus garnishes are generally great for cocktails that do not contain milk or cream, although there are creamy cocktails that call for citrus garnishes such as orange spirals. Maraschino cherries complement many different types of cocktails, but should never be used in certain cocktails, such as a standard martini. Many garnishes complement one of the primary cocktail ingredients. A pear slice is used to garnish an Asian Pear Martini, and a Razzmopolitan is garnished with raspberries. Tomato-based cocktails are generally garnished with limes, lemons and celery stalks. Always consider how the garnish will complement the flavor of the primary ingredients. Vodka-based cocktails tend to pair well with lemon and lime flavors, tequila and rum pair well with limes, rum can pair well with mint, chocolate pairs with creme de cacao liqueur, and coffee beans complement coffee liqueur. Also consider the overall theme of the drink. Tropical cocktails may use tropical fruits, and dessert cocktails may use cookies or chocolate. A cocktail that uses spiced rum may be garnished with a cinnamon stick. 3. Rim the glass. The rim of the empty glass can be coated with garnishes such as fine sugar, salt, cocoa powder, finely grated chocolate and finely crushed graham crackers or cookies. To coat the rim of a glass, first spread or mound the garnish ingredient on a small plate or tray, then briefly rub around the rim of the glass with something such as a lemon wedge to moisten it. The garnish will adhere to the area that is moistened. Then lay the glass on its side so that the rim is touching the garnish, and rotate or roll the glass on the garnish so that the entire rim is coated. The glass can also just be placed upside down on the rimming ingredient and rotated somewhat to coat the rim. Additional garnishes may be added to cocktails that are served in rimmed glasses. 4. Prepare standard or simple garnishes. Garnishes generally need to be prepared before the cocktail is mixed. Common, relatively simple garnishes for cocktails include maraschino cherries as well as citrus wedges, wheels, twists and spirals. Olives, cocktail onions and celery stalks are also commonly used for certain drinks. • Wheels are made by simply slicing a fruit widthwise. The ends of the fruit are disposed of, and the slices should be about 1/4"" thick. To make wedges, first cut off and dispose of the ends of the fruit, then slice the fruit into eight wedges. Start by cutting the fruit in half from one cut end to the other (lengthwise). Then slice each half lengthwise (in half) to produce four wedges, then slice each of the four wedges in half lengthwise to produce the eight wedges. Make a single slice in the middle area of the meat of the wedges and halfway through wheels (from the edge to the center) with a paring knife and stick them onto the rim of the glass. Also coat wedges and spirals in fine sugar. • Spirals can be dangled from the rim of the glass. Twists are twisted, bent or rolled to release the citrus skin oils and to give them their characteristic shape, then dropped into the drink. Twists can be about an inch or more long, while spirals can be a few or more inches long. Twists and spirals can both be made relatively easily with a channel knife tool. Try making twists by running the channel knife tool lengthwise along a lemon (or other citrus fruit), and make spirals by running the channel knife around a lemon. Twists and spirals can also be made by cutting the rind of a citrus fruit into strips with a paring knife. • Garnishes such as cherries, cocktail olives and cocktail onions can be speared with toothpicks and rested on the rim of the glass or merely dropped into the drink and allowed to rest on the bottom of the glass, especially if the drink is not opaque. If multiple such fruits are going to be used to garnish one cocktail, it is best to spear them together with a toothpick. • For an easy but attractive garnish, rest a sprig of mint on the glass rim or on the drink. Cinnamon sticks can simply be rested on the rim of the glass or placed vertically in the drink. 5. Prepare more elaborate or exotic garnishes. Use a toothpick to stick together different fruits to make fruit ""flags"" and ""boats"". Flags are stuck onto the rim of the glass, with one fruit stuck on top of another. Boats essentially rest against the rim and on or partially in the drink, but are not stuck onto the rim of the glass. However, a boat garnish can rest on the rim of the glass with the help of a toothpick. An orange and cherry boat is made by placing a cherry on the center of an orange wheel and bending the slice somewhat around the cherry like a taco. A toothpick is inserted through the orange slice and the cherry to keep the slice curved like a boat around the cherry. Use boats with frothy cocktails. Try using fruits such as pineapples, bananas, kiwis and berries when making fruit flags. Leave fruits unpeeled when slicing them into garnishes such as wheels. Strawberries and other fruits can be dipped in melted chocolate and placed on the rim of the glass. * To make a chocolate-dipped strawberry that can be placed on the rim of a glass, first melt some chocolate, then carefully dip the strawberry in the chocolate and allow the extra chocolate to drip off. The chocolate should be allowed to cool and solidify somewhat so that is doesn't drip down the glass. Set the strawberry down on parchment paper or wax paper for a short period of time, or keep it suspended vertically so that the chocolate drips downward evenly and forms an even coating. When the chocolate has become stable but is still somewhat gooey, make a vertical slice in the bottom of the strawberry through the chocolate-dipped part, and place it on the rim of the glass. If the chocolate has been allowed to solidify completely, it may crack and break off somewhat when the strawberry is sliced and placed on the rim. The strawberry can be placed on an empty glass before straining or pouring the drink, and try chilling the glass and/or the strawberry first so that the chocolate solidifies rapidly. 6. Garnish the prepared cocktail. Right after mixing the cocktail, garnish the cocktail as called for by the recipe or as desired. Grate or zest garnishes fresh right over the drink just before serving."	"Float coffee beans on frothy cocktails. Also float citrus spirals and thin fruit wheels (such as apple wheels) on various cocktails, not just frothy ones. Cocktails made with hot coffee or hot chocolate (usually referred to as ""warmers""), such as Irish Cream Coffee and Black Forest Hot Chocolate may be topped with whipped cream, and then garnished with grated chocolate, cocoa powder or a maraschino cherry."

Look in the mirror and say to yourself every day ""I love you"". Please don't let yourself become cocky. It's good to be reminded of our strengths and weaknesses on a daily basis. It's proactive to remind ourselves what needs work in our lives. 2. Surround yourself with a great group of friends. That is right! Get rid of the people in your life who aren't good for you. We all grow up and realize that some people are there for no reason whatsoever. It might be hard to rid yourself of them, but in the long run, it's worth it. 3. Edit your closet each season. It is always good to donate the clothing that can be reused and rid yourself of items that are falling apart. It helps refresh your wardrobe and makes you aware of the key pieces you need to purchase for that season. 4. Say please and thank you, hold the door for the person behind you and don't forget to hand write a thank you note when it's appropriate. Why do all of these things? Because having good manners never goes out of style. 5. Find a good tailor in your area and utilize them. I don't care what you pay for an article of clothing. It isn't going to look great if it isn't tailored for your body. Usually alterations run from $5.00 to $20.00. It is money well spent when you realize how different you look. 6. When shopping, purchase classic pieces first. This way you have a good basis for your wardrobe. These pieces should fit you well and become staples to base outfits off of. Trendy pieces should be kept to a minimum each season. Buy only a few that you really love. Not only will this keep your closet from getting crowded it will help save money. 7. Remember that even on a budget you can look good. These days you can buy clothes everywhere from Target to Dolce and Gabbana. Shop in your price range and know what looks good on your body. Take the time to really learn what is going to look best on you. 8. Dress your age. I have said this before and will say it many times again. 50-year-old women do not need to be wearing a halter-top and mini skirt. Likewise, 20-year-old women do not need to be showing their mid-drift and ass cleavage. Part of dressing your age and being sexy is showing just a hint of skin. Trust me when I say it's much more appealing then seeing all of your supposed assets. 9. It is always better to be overdressed; it is much better than showing up at an event and being the only person in jeans. If you walk into a room in a great dress and terrific shoes and everyone else is wearing jeans and a t-shirt don't even think twice about it. People are going to look at you and think wow she looks great. Just be comfortable in what you are wearing and enjoy it. 10."	"It is not stylish or attractive to say, ""This old thing"" or ""Hardly."" Enjoy the compliment and even if you don't believe it saying thank you will make you feel better. After a time you will start to believe that you do look good. It's a great confidence building exercise."

When picking out clothes, you can choose any style you want wether it be skater or emo. For me the easiest style is just casual. What you can do is find a big baggy t-shirt or even a large sweatshirt. Wearing a sports bra for girls with more ""cleavage"" this will help with looking more flat chested. You can even buy a wrap to help even more. Once you have the shirt (or sweatshirt) you need some pants. If you don't have a brother that you can steal some boxers from, then you can put on a pair of running shorts. Then one easy thing to do is take a pair of long shorts and use those. If it's cold and you want pants, then you can take a pair of skinny jeans and make them sag. 2. When picking out shoes, make sure that there are not sparkles or glitter, guys don't wear that. A lot of guys simply wear black converse. Of course if you want to look better, you can find some cool used skate shoes at a thrift store. 3. If you are a girl with short hair (like a pixie cut), you may be able to pull off not wearing a hat."	Put your hair up in a regular pony tail. Then find a base ball cap with no hole in the back. ( you can find a bunch of cool ones at walmart for around ten bucks) then you can just stuff your hair inside the hat and call it good. Although if you want to look like a long haired guy since you have bangs, you can pull your bangs out the front of the hat to look more long haired.

Research the safety of marijuana as a medical drug. The primary concern relating to marijuana involves its safety. All medical drugs must be proven to be relatively safe. Marijuana use can result in an increased heart rate, which may in turn trigger a heart attack. THC can induce an altered state and cause what has been referred to as acute psychosis. Some studies have also indicated that marijuana use may be associated with schizophrenia, but this is has not been proven.	This is partially demonstrated by the fact that cannabidiol is a powerful anti-psychotic. Scientific studies have also shown that cannabidiol is not psychoactive (won't get you high), and can effectively counteract the negative effects of THC. Cannabidiol is also quite safe, especially when taken as a natural component of marijuana. Smoked marijuana may contribute to diseases of the lung, but has not been shown to be overly associated with lung cancer as cannabinoids have been shown to prevent cancer. Marijuana is also not considered to be addictive.

These credit cards (which should be available from most local banks and credit unions) work basically the same way as a collateral-secured loan &mdash; you give the credit issuer a certain amount of money, and in turn the credit issuer gives you a line of credit that you can spend as you please.

Analyze your essay question or prompt. Carefully reading your prompt is the first step in the essay writing process. Make sure you clearly understand what your essay needs to accomplish. Circle or underline keywords, such as “analyze” or “compare and contrast.” * Note that an essay prompt’s keywords have distinct meanings. Analyze, for example, doesn’t mean to describe; it means to pull apart and examine something’s structure. * Suppose you have to analyze an argument. Your essay needs identify the argument's rhetorical elements, such as pathos (appeals to emotion) or logos (employing reason or logic). After breaking down the argument's structure, you'll then need to explain how the author uses these devices to make their case. 2. Research your subject matter. Once you understand your essay’s task, find credible sources on your topic. Examine primary sources, such as the poem you’re analyzing or letters written by the historical figure you’re discussing. Read what other scholars have argued, and identify how expert opinions on your topic vary. * Remember to check your sources’ credibility. If you’re writing about a former president, find the biography scholars consider most authoritative. Check the authoritative biography’s footnotes and references, which will help you track down more reputable sources. * You won't conduct thorough research if you’re writing an essay for a test. Instead, read the sources provided with the exam. For example, if a literature essay test requires you to analyze an excerpt, read the passage carefully. 3. Develop a succinct, arguable thesis. Once you’ve familiarized yourself with your topic, come up with an argument. Your thesis should be a concise sentence that tells readers what you plan to argue. Rather than vaguely generalize or state the obvious, an effective thesis makes a clear, defensible, and specific claim. * For instance, “Schools should implement mandatory uniforms because they reduce disciplinary issues, help students focus on learning, and promote school spirit,” is clear and specific. * The thesis, “Mandatory uniforms are beneficial, so schools should implement them,” makes a claim, but “beneficial” is vague. It doesn’t convey why uniforms are good, so it’s not a strong thesis. 4. Create an outline to map out your essay’s structure. The basic parts of an essay are an introduction, the body, and a conclusion. A good essay is well-organized, and each part transitions smoothly and logically to the next. To begin your outline, write the Roman number I., label it “Introduction” then, on the line below, write your thesis statement. * For the next Roman numerals, write the subtopics, citations, and other details that you’ll cover in each body paragraph. * In the following example, Roman number II. would be an essay section, and letters A. through D. are body paragraphs that each focus on a sub-topic:II. Uniforms reduce disciplinary issues&emsp; A. 44% decrease in detentions after introducing uniforms (Smith, 2017)&emsp; B. Suspension decreased by 60% (Smith, 2017)&emsp; C. Absenteeism and tardiness decreased (Pew, 2013)&emsp; D. 66% of students report less bullying (Ohio Board of Education, 2016) 5. Use the TEEL strategy to organize your paragraphs. TEEL stands for Topic sentence, Explain, Evidence or example, and Link, or refer to the essay’s main idea. If your sentences are logically connected, your argument will be clearer and more convincing. For example: * Topic sentence: School uniforms may reduce the number of serious behavioral problems. * Explain: Evidence suggests dressing alike lowers peer pressure, promotes discipline, and prevents the display of controversial or offensive imagery. * Evidence: For example, according to the Ohio Board of Education, schools that introduced uniforms reported 44% fewer disciplinary referrals, such as detentions and suspensions. Furthermore, 66% of surveyed students said they witnessed fewer bullying incidents after they started wearing uniforms. * Link: These findings suggest that implementing uniforms is an effective way to foster a disciplined school environment. 6. Address a counterargument to strengthen your claim. Mention an argument that opposes your thesis, then explain why it’s incorrect. Be sure to bring up a strong counterargument. Countering a weak argument that doesn’t actually represent the opposing side’s strongest claims will weaken your essay. * A counterargument could be, “Opponents claim that mandatory uniforms stifle self-expression and lower self-esteem.	In a 10-year Oxford University study, a majority of students reported that wearing uniforms boosts their self-esteem. With a level playing field, they worry less about choosing clothes that fit the norm.”

Rest your injured collarbone and apply ice. Once you're discharged from the hospital or clinic, you'll be told to rest your arm and apply ice to the injury while the arm sling or splint is on in order to help decrease the swelling and numb the pain. On the first day following your fracture, apply the ice or cold therapy for 20 minutes of every hour while you're awake. For the following 2-4 days, ice the inflamed and painful area every 3-4 hours for 20 minutes at a time. With applying cold therapy and taking NSAIDs, the inflammation should be gone after a week. * Depending on your job and if you injured your dominant arm, you may have to take a few weeks off work to recuperate. In general, healing takes 4-6 weeks in younger people and as long as 12 weeks in the elderly. * Young athletes are often able to resume playing their sport within 8 weeks of breaking their collarbones, but it depends on the severity of the break, type of sport and many other factors. * If you don't have any ice handy, then you can use frozen gel packs or bags of vegetables from your freezer.	.

Try to become friends with him. Just don't get too clingy. Don't do anything illegal. For instance, don't just randomly assault him without warning. This is bad, could get you in alot of trouble. 2. Talk to him and see if their interests are similiar to yours. If they are, it's good. But, don't worry if you don't have similiar interests. You and him, you're still both human. 3. Understand, truly, this could lead you to him telling on you and you not being able to stick up for yourself because they think they are right, but you have your reason and truly just can't explain yourself clearly because you will make a fool of yourself, you might think. 4. Ask him about kissing and what he thinks of gay people and girls and that sort of thing, if they don't accept gayness, then kissing them really won't work, it might creep them out. If they love gay people and they are really nice and the most they have ever hurt someone was just a push you might be in luck, you might get a kiss. 5. When you kiss them, honestly, please try not to close your eyes and be all weird. You have to understand this is very new to them, and on the off chance they will let you kiss them, being a good kisser in their eyes will make them feel good about them selves. But, again, this is on an off chance. 6. If they aren't of really similiar age, really consider why you are doing this. Also, try and be confident. 7.	.

A warm face towel will do if you haven't got a steamer but a facial scrub is crucial.Use the moisturiser in place of the cleanser if you haven't got a cleanser and repeat at the end. 4. Start with gently cleansing the face(get permission first!) by applying the cleanser on the face skin and rub with your hands (washed and dried). Rub the cleanser in circular movements from the chin upwards. If possible your friend should be lying on a bed and you standing at the head of the bed looking down at her face or she/he can sit on an armchair allowing him/her to lean back. 5. Wipe off the cleanser with a warm moist face towel.At this point set the steamer up if you have one and have used it before otherwise use a face towel.Wrap the rinsed warm moist towel on the face leaving the nostrils free for breathing.Leave for about 15 minutes. You could massage the feet during this time.After 15 minutes the skin pores will be open to release any material blocking them(see Acne1 post). Apply the facial scrub and repeat the procedure described for cleansing.Massage the face in circular movements for 5 minutes and wipe off with a clean moist face towel twice. 6.	.

First of all, where there are problems involving space, considering big is better than to small. The smaller you think, the worse of your mood; On the other hand, the greater you think, the better of your mood. For example, to think Beijing is better than to Chaoyang district; Likewise, to think China is better than to Beijing; To the world than to China; To think the universe is better than to the world again. When you feel depressed, just think of the universe, compared to it, we are small, then our mood will suddenly enlightened. What’s more, we feel nothing worth boring. 2. Take a few photos every day. Psychologists suggest that use camera to take a picture of some people and things around everyday, such as the trees outside the window, the roadside flowers, the kids in the neighborhood and the friend’s wedding. Record these fragments which are easily forgotten at any time, when you take out these photos, you will find that all the details are good memories and nothing deserves complaining. Therefore, through this progress people can easily become happy. 3. Participate in collective activities. While being alone is also one of the ways to adjust the mood, do not save your own time to rest, just share some to the collective activity. Mountain climbing, outing, flying a rc plane, picnic, party, song fans... Encourage yourself to take an active part in activities, you will find the power of being strong and calm in the common play. 4. Sad movies. Watch a sad movie, such as “when a man loves a woman”, when feeling difficult to endure it, you might as well cry aloud. Then say to yourself, well it's just a movie which is not a real life, so that your mood will be improved. This is a method of reverse thinking, which is often used in psychology to help people think about questions in perspective. 5. Have a daydream in the the morning at weekend. Many capable housewives will get up early in the morning on Saturday, and non-stop to do household chores, such as cleaning, cleaning toilets, etc. Such habits often can let a person feel tired on Saturday night, which will affect the sleep quality on Sunday. Might as well temporarily put aside those trivial housework, on the weekend morning to make a beautiful daydream. Don’t blame yourself, instead you should encourage yourselves: “I work so hard, and deserves squandering time to rest, right.” 6. Regular email. Keep in touch with your old friends by sending emails on a regular basis. People who have a habit of keeping a diary, just doodle on the paper or simply write a few words, which can reflect the subconscious psychology, so can the email. And sending regular emails with friends, not only can help you let go of things, can also help you make up the indifference of friendship by talking about the recent life. 7. Eat a big meal Occasionally. A big meal’s beauty lies in the fact that it can not only enjoy delicious food, but also can make you feel like that you have a special treatment. When one enjoys a different care from other people, his mood will become well unknowingly. In childhood we may all have such experience: when parents bought a beautiful bowl which is specially for you, you will happily eat more food than usual, and even if the food that you don’t love will also became “cute”. 8. Drinking coffee, while reading a novel. Pick a famous cafe, bring a novel that recently most interests you, choose one by the window, sit down and order a cup of coffee and read over coffee... Yes, this is the “Petit bourgeois” that often appears in the movie. But what it matters, just allow yourself to experience some romantic scenes in the movie, and you will also be affected by atmosphere and get the true relaxation and enjoyment. 9. Swimming on a regular basis. Swimming is one of the most energetic movement, but this kind of exhausting activity can let a person get rid of the troubles and stretch the mind and body. Choosing a person to go swimming is good also. Surrounded by water, again the bad mood can also be softened. 10.	Even though some someone once say this is the A Q’s method of victory, I also prefer to do this, after all, it is more meaningful than live a gloomy life.

Find out about development aid. Harvard Professor Jeffre Sachs published in 2005 the book ""The End of Poverty"" . In it, he makes concrete suggestions as to how extreme poverty can be overcome in Africa. His main finding is that Africa itself can not escape the economic hardship. The rich Western countries need to help financially and with personnel. Jeffrey Sachs has developed a concrete plan for overcoming poverty in Africa: * The agricultural income of the farmers could by good advice and some resources (irrigation, fertilizer, high-performance seed) can be doubled easily. * For the larger crop is not eaten immediately, the population growth should be stopped by a specific family counseling and the free distribution of contraceptives. * The funds must democratically be managed by the communities themselves so they do not disappear in the government corruption. * The poor countries must be freed from their debt burdens, so that they have money to overcome the poverty. * There must be an adequate infrastructure (schools, roads, health, electricity). 2. Orient up of successful models. There are examples of ecological self-sufficient communities, where aid workers can be based on. That sustainable development works, proved the actor Karlheinz Böhm in Ethiopia. He has personally supervised four villages and collected donations in Germany. He established an organic agriculture and thus preserves an entire tract of land from starvation. It took more than a decade, but today, the villages are self-sufficient in everything necessary. 3. Connect Help and Self-Help. The main solution to the world hunger problem is the principle of self-sufficiency through their own country. Every farmer should have the right to have his own piece of land from which he can live with his family. The landless farmers have to get fertile land by the governments. * The landlords must give a portion of their land to the poor. Without land reforms, the world hunger problem can not be solved. Some new agricultural land can also be created. This can happen by the forestation of desert areas. Deforestation must be stopped. Instead establishing monocultures (oil palm, biofuel) for export, each country should provide sufficient land for the population. * Small farmers in developing countries must be helped with a good advice from agricultural experts, an effective organic farming, with cooperative structures and a fair global trade. 4. Promote the common sense. It is important to promote the common sense in the world. Without a return to the values of frugality, inner happiness, universal love and mutual aid the world can not be saved. If egoism dominates the happiness in the world has no chance. We need a world family, which consists of many small families, and where everyone helps everyone, so it all goes well. 5. Build islands of happiness first. The village communities should become places of happiness, so that rural migration ends. If people have arrived in the city slums, it is very difficult to get them back. In the slums we have to built up positive structures in a special way. But everywhere a new culture of civic spirit is very important. 6. Work for the cooperation of all positive people. We need a global change. This can happen only through a global alliance of all positive forces in politics, science, religion and society."	.

They are not actual sharks, but were named this way because of the shark-like appearance of their topedo-shaped bodies and rigid dorsal fins.	Taking good care of bala sharks involves selecting the right tank, ensuring the best water chemistry, finding agreeable neighbors, and making sure to clean the tank and change its water regularly. If you give them the attention they need, these popular and attractive fish can provide you with years of enjoyment.

And provide a bed of rocks that is darker in color--this will allow the fishes’ silvery color to stand out better, and also helps them to feel secure. 4. Set up a heater. Since these fish come from a tropical environment, and will be living in a large tank, they’ll need a good heater to keep the large amount of water at the right temperature. An appropriate temperature range is 72 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (22.2 to 26.7 degrees Celsius). 5. Monitor the water’s hardness and pH. Fill the tank with fresh water from the tap, and test its pH and hardness levels. Appropriate ranges are 6.5 to 7.8 for pH, and a water hardness of 2 to 10 dGH. Ask a tank specialist at the pet store about available gaugues for monitoring these levels. * If you live in an area that takes its water from wells in limestone bedrock, the tap water will tend to be on the harder side. If the water comes from lakes, it will usually be softer. * While you can buy chemicals to adjust pH, you can also use peat in the tank or filter to raise acidity, and calcium salts to raise alkalinity. 6. Ensure enough water movement. Since bala sharks are river fish, they are adapted to aquatic environments with steadily moving water. Buy a filter for your tank that is powerful enough to keep a steadily moving current running and provide enough oxygen for the fish. * A large canister filter can take care of oxygen, current, and water purity.	.

Most colleges use a ""holistic"" admissions process, meaning that the school will consider your achievement in many areas-- both objective and subjective. A weakness in one area can be outweighed by a strength in another, and vice versa. * Your academic record. Colleges will see this quantitatively in the form of your four-year transcript and GPA, as well as qualitatively in your teachers' and counselor's recommendation comments. Admissions officers want to see that you can succeed in an academically challenging environment. * Your standardized test scores. Most colleges, particularly the more selective ones, require the ACT or SAT. * Your extracurriculars. Colleges seek students who are engaged outside of the classroom. Participating in a breadth of activities can indicate that you are a well-rounded person, but colleges also seek depth of engagement, which you can indicate through pursuing leadership positions or independent projects. * Your character. Essays, letters of recommendation, and interviews all combine to convey your personality. * Your background. Colleges evaluate your achievements in the context of your circumstances-- for example, admissions officers will not expect you to have taken eight AP courses if your school offers none. Similarly, background can illuminate character, and colleges will be impressed by an applicant who excels despite personal hardship. * Your ""fit"" with a particular college. The word ""fit"" can seem maddeningly nebulous: what exactly does it mean to be a good match for a certain school?"	.

You won't be able to get over a guy unless you accept what your relationship was.

Own up to the fact you were used, even if it's painful, and this is not someone who will ever offer you a relationship. * In the wake of rejection, people often have unrealistic thoughts about the importance of a relationship.

Know why your puppy is biting. Sometimes puppies bite when they're just playing around. Other times, the biting signifies something more serious. Try to gauge why your puppy is biting in order to help you come up with a specific solution. Puppies may also bite because of the following reasons: * Puppy's teeth may hurt or bother it. * When a puppy gets too excited, it may lose control and bite. * A puppy just bites and nips you to get attention. * If your puppy is nasty, stubborn, or aggressive, it's very likely that it bites anybody around it. 2. Learn about bite inhibition. Bite inhibition is a term for a puppy's ability to control the force of his bite.Young puppies often do not know how hard they are biting, and so they bite playfully without understanding how sensitive humans or dogs can be. Puppies usually learn that they're biting hard by playing with other puppies. * Puppies will nip and bite each other playfully until one puppy is nipped too hard and gives out a high-pitched yell. The victim will stop playing, and the puppy who bit the victim is taken aback and also stops playing for a while. * Pretty soon, both puppies are at it again, playing and wrestling around with one another. If one puppy happens to bite another too hard, the same thing happens and both puppies tend to withdraw for a bit. This feedback loop teaches the offending puppy that his bites can actually hurt other puppies (and people), evidence that the puppy uses to modify his behavior. 3. Start the feedback cycle with your puppy so that he will learn bite inhibition. Maybe your puppy plays with other puppies; maybe he doesn't. He'll need to start playing with you in order to start getting feedback on what he's doing wrong and what he's doing right. This will help him to learn bite inhibition. * Play with your puppy using your hands until your puppy bites you harder than acceptable. When he does, give out a high-pitched yelp, imitating the yelp of a dog. If you can't yelp, a simple but stern ""Too bad!” or ""No bite!"" or “You blew it!” will work. Stop playing for a little bit. * If your puppy licks you or tries to comfort you, praise him."	If he starts to bite harder again, let out your yelp or stern rebuke and withdraw from playing again.

Control your calorie intake. If you want to lose weight, you'll have to restrict your calorie intake - simple as that. Luckily, the belly is one of the first places to trim down once you start losing weight, so it is easier to shift than stubborn bum, thigh or arm fat. * One pound of fat equals 3500 calories. In other words, in order to lose one pound of fat per week, you will need to cut 3500 calories from your weekly diet. * Don't lie to yourself about your calorie intake. Keep track of every bite that passes your lips in a food diary or online calorie tracker. * Eating a healthy diet and reducing your calories accounts for 80% of weight loss, so don't fool yourself into thinking that you can eat whatever you like as long as you exercise. * A healthy goal is to lose between 1 and 2 pounds per week - any more than that is considered crash dieting and the weight loss will be nearly impossible to maintain. * Depending on how overweight you are to begin with, women should eat between 1500 and 2000 calories per day in order to safely lose weight, while men should eat between 2000 and 2500. 2. Eat more fiber. Eating more soluble fiber is essential for healthy weight loss. It helps to cut down on visceral fat, which is the potentially dangerous fat stored around vital organs such as the heart, lungs and liver. People who store fat in their bellies are more likely to have a higher percentage of visceral fat than those who don't. * Breakfast is one of the easiest meals to incorporate more fiber into. Switch to eating high fiber cereals or oatmeal. Eat wholegrain breads and bake muffins with wheat bran. * Leave the skin on fruits and vegetables (such as apples, carrots and potatoes) as much as possible, as the skin contains the most fiber (in addition to the most vitamins and nutrients). * Introduce more split peas, beans (black, kidney, pinto) and nuts (almonds, peanuts) into your diet, as these foods are all high in fiber. 3. Cut out sugar. Sugar is the enemy when it comes to fighting belly fat, as it's full of empty calories which provide no nutritional benefit whatsoever. * When too much sugar is consumed, the body cannot process it, so it's gets converted into fat and stored in places such as the belly, butt, thighs and breasts. * Naturally-occurring sugars, such as those found in fruit, are okay (in moderation), so it's really the added-in sugars you need to watch out for. These sugars are found in most packaged and processed foods, such as ready-to-eat cereals, candy, yeast breads and sodas. *	This is the case for many yogurts, cheeses and sauces.

Talk to your toddler. A child who is 3 years of age or older can usually understand if you explain why he or she needs to take medication. If your child is still having a hard time taking his or her medication, level with him or her. It’s important to be honest with your child and not lie to make things better. You may find that appealing to your toddler’s sense of reasoning can help him or her take the medication. * Tell your child you know the medicine tastes bad and that the icky taste will go away quickly if he or she takes it quickly and in a way you suggested. * Explain why medication will help your toddler. Asking your toddler why the medication is necessary can help start a simple conversation that may help him or her take the meds. * Remember to reassure your child and be honest. Say, “I know the medication is really yucky, Katharina. But taking it will make you feel better and take away your ouches.” You may want to bolster this statement by adding something tempting like “You’ll be able to go back to the playground soon if you take your medication.” 2. Find a different delivery method. If your child is having difficulty taking one form of medication, see if others are available. Many companies offer their medications in liquid, capsule, and chewable options to appeal to a variety of patients. Get in contact with your doctor to see if he or she can prescribe a different delivery method for your child’s medication. * Consider asking your doctor if you can get the medication in a higher concentration, which may mean a smaller dose. * Make sure to let your child know if you change the delivery method. For example, you can say, “No more yucky pills, Christina. I got you a medicine you can drink that is purple and tastes like strawberries!” 3. Use two adults to give the toddler medication. If your child is being especially uncooperative, enlist the help of a friend or loved one. This may not be pleasant for any of you, but it can help get the process over quickly.	.

Let's start off with what a histogram is: A histogram is a digital representation of the tonal values of your image. As you may or may not know, a digital camera works similar to how a computer screen works. There are 256 values ranging from 0 - 255. Please note when I use the term ""tonal value"", I am not referring to color. Color (or Hue) is represented by three values RGB (Red, Green & Blue), while tone is represented in the numbers 0 - 255. To get a hue you actually take the values of each color and add them together. For instance, a color Red: 200, Green: 125, & Blue: 60 would produce a darkish orange-brown. A lot of red, a little more than half of that green and about half of that blue. So, that hue, which turns out to be a hue of 20º will always be that orange color and can be made more or less saturated and more or less bright but the main hue is the same. I hope that this is not all confusing to you as it's something you really don't have to worry about at this stage of the game. Color will not influence the histogram in terms of exposure, only brightness will. I just wanted you to know that there is a difference and what it is. Enough said about that. Histogram Explained"	The easiest way to understand it is as I heard it explained, which is like this.

It may hurt after a few times but this builds character and thickens your shoulders. You could also lift weights at the gym or get one of your linemen to give you some tips. 2. When you are about to come in contact with your opposition i basically follow one rule. LOWER MAN WINS! if you have a lower center of gravity than him, you have more leverage which will help you make him eat turf! 3. Speed is the most important!

Yes, pedalling looks like an up and down motion- this is partially true. However, there are the forward and backward motions to be considered also. 2. Whn pushing down with your lead leg (leg thats most forward) drive down and forward using your Quads to control the speed of the rotation. Keep the bottom of your foot parallel with the floor I.E flat. to aid with this, when you drive down, try to focus on driving your heel down at the same time. Practive in a mirrior on a Spinning bike to perfect this. 3.	Switching from your quads, your Hamstrings and calves are the main muscles working here. Imagine you had something on the bottom of your shoe and you're trying to 'scrape' it off on the floor- this is how this part of the pedal stroke should be. Scrape your foot to fully engage your hamstrings and calves. your heel will come up slightly, angling the foot slightly upwards. This is normal.

Feed the cockatiel the correct food. Cockatiels love egg whites, corn, grapes, sunflower seeds, and the mixture of seeds available at the pet shop. Additionally, there are number of different pellet formulations, designed by veterinarians, that are intended to provide a nutrient rich and balanced diet. Try to use pellets and vegetables to keep their seed intake to a minimum (33% or less, preferably). An all-seed or mostly-seed diet is extremely high in fat, and will shorten a cockatiel's lifespan dramatically 2. Get the right size cage. Make sure you have the right size cage for your cockatiel.

The cage doesn't have to be large – medium is fine. Though remember that the smaller the cage, the more time your cockatiel will need to spend outside of it to get the necessary exercise and mental stimulation. 3. If your cockatiel isn't hand-raised, try to teach it. Start slow just by talking calmly to it while it is in its cage, and let it get used to you. Once it is familiar with you, you can start by offering it a treat. If you are patient, and let the bird become comfortable with you at its own pace, then you will be rewarded with a lasting bond between you and your bird. Once it is willing to step on your hand, you can try to take it out of the cage, but do so in small steps. 4. Head scratches. Some cockatiels will be cuddly, and others less so. But once they discover them, almost all of them love to have their head and neck scratched. It's easy to tell if he or she is in the mood, as they will tip their head down, inviting you to scratch them. 5. Never overdo contact. Timing is everything. When your bird is getting used to you, try not to disturb them too much. A couple of times a day is normally a good starting point. Once they get used to you though, be willing to engage them. If your cockatiel paces back and forth near the cage door, they want to come out. Sometimes it's to play, other times it's just for company or scratching/cuddling. Take your time while you are learning what your cockatiel likes, and you will have a happy bird for many years. Don't forget that they are social creatures in the wild, and they need your companionship to be happy. 6. Use perches. Make sure you put lots of perches in the cage so that your cockatiel is free to walk and jump around the cage. If positioned correctly, a cockatiel may be able to fly between perches too.	Give them interesting textures and shapes too. The smooth dowel rods that often come with cages are boring and often uncomfortable for birds. Natural wood perches (of a safe species) and rope perches are ideal.

Installing Mayline office furniture is actually quite simple. The first step is always to get your products into the area where you want to build. It's important to first locate the directions and save your shipping cartons just in case you find any concealed shipping damage. Mayline will be happy to replace any damaged goods (always a plus.) 2. Once your products are out of the box and you've located the instructions you can begin. I suggest having a 12v drill on hand as this will make your life much easier. With all Mayline products you first want to locate the desk top and flip it over. Once flipped you will need to locate the pre-drilled holes. One great thing about Mayline is that most all of there furniture is pre-drilled for you. So, if you don't have a drill don't worry. 3. Now that you've located the pre-drills you can begin. Find the adjacent legs and screw them to the flipped over desktop. Make sure you put the screw in feet on the legs to avoid doing this when the desk is already flipped over. Next you will want to add you modest panel (the front section of the desk that hides your legs. To do so, you will locate the pre-drilled holes on the outer side of the legs you've added and attach accordingly. Flip your desk over and you should be good to go. Make sure to check for any concealed damage you may have missed during shipping. This rarely happens but if so, just take some pics and they will help you out in a jiffy. 4.	This is by far the hardest part of your install, but still is very possible with one person. To build this unit, locate the opposite sides along with the top and bottom of the overhead. You will again notice pre-drilled holes that typically require furniture pins and single-turn tightening screws. Place the wood furniture pins in the top and bottom of your overhead only. Then connect your sides to the top and bottom using the screws. Once this is complete, just add on your doors and your all done! Be careful when lifting the overhead onto the desk as it easy to scratch. I recommend using some of the packing material on your work surface to get the overhead where you want it. Once situated simply lift once side of the overhead and slide out.

Remember that he is your friend. He will only ever be your friend: The key here is to be oblivious. When he starts dropping hints about how good you two would be together, just shrug it off with a laugh. Or how much he likes a 'girl' but she does not seem to notice, just nod sympathetically and say ""that sucks"" or ""that's too bad, you really deserve better."" Then change the subject. Quickly. 2. Make him see the value of your friendship: Talk about your boyfriend, commiserate with him over your life dramas, make it clear that you are absolutely comfortable with him because, to you, he is sexless. He will start to realise that you value him as a confidante and he will be even more reluctant to wreck things by needlessly confessing his feelings. 3. Let him see the negative side of you: You might be prone to gossiping, hate children, really messy or you swear way too much. When guys fall in love or 'like' they put the girl on a pedestal. To him, everything about you is perfect. You must destroy this pedestal and quickly. This could mean really embarrassing things like letting him see you without make up (if you always wear it) or tell an inconvenient truth like ""I can't wait to move away after school/college/this job finishes and travel. I'd hate to get tied down!"" Pretty much do the opposite of what you would do or say to a guy you have a crush on. 4. Decline invitations to go out to dinner or anything resembling a date with just the two of you. Just say you're too busy or you might be feeling really sick or you've already made plans. If he's really persistent, you might have to be cruel to be kind. Tell him you're going on a date. 5. Meeting for coffee after class or work is fine, but don't do it too often. Regular outings like shopping or team sports is great - that's the sort of thing you do with your mates. 6. Lead by example: Be a good friend to him, but don't go too far. If he is upset or angry or hurt you are welcome to comfort him."	.

Confront your own biases and assumptions and ask yourself why you have a problem with him viewing porn. Tell your husband how you feel and why. Put aside all blame and focus on understanding. 2. Understand your husband likely turns to porn because it is an easy way for him to take care of his sexual desires/needs. Some women appreciate their husbands using porn as a form of self-gratification because it allows intimacy between them to be based on romance and mutual desire rather than the innate physical desire that we all have (although not always at the same time). Many couples compromise by setting a few nights a week for sex. (You should make time for sex more than once per week. If in doubt, ask him and ask yourself how often you both honestly feel you need to have sexual release. He may say daily. If he does and this isn't realistic, work out something reasonable to both of you. Keep in mind your goal is to satisfy each other's needs, so you may need to compromise. 3. Understand that some porn perverts or over exaggerates normal healthy sexual acts. Just as many people enjoy watching action movies, this does not mean that they actually want to on any level partake in the violence they see. Watching sexual acts that are out of the ordinary allows for one to enjoy vicariously what would be out of the question in real life.	If your sex life seems dull and reiterative, this may cause him to watch more than he would otherwise. Also, remember that there is nothing wrong with gratifying yourself. If this brings you to tears, it's ok. You’re justified in getting emotional; in fact it would be good to acknowledge and discuss your feelings. Let each other know you are committed and aim to empower each other sexually. It may be hard to do at this point, but you have to be committed to accepting human nature for what it is. If he agrees, great! You’re ready to start working on rebuilding intimacy.

Select and store cinnamon for the freshness. Available in both stick and powder form, cinnamon should be handled with care to obtain the highest amount of potency. * Seal cinnamon in a tightly sealed glass container and store in a cool, dark, dry place. Use a jelly jar or canning materials for best results. * Ground cinnamon can be kept fresh for up to six months. Cinnamon sticks may stay fresh for up to one year. * Extend cinnamon’s shelf life by storing the spice in the refrigerator in a well-sealed container. * Smell the cinnamon to check for freshness. Make sure it has a sweet smell — a true indicator that it is fresh. 2. Buy organic cinnamon. Choose organically grown cinnamon to ensure that it has not been irradiated. Irradiating cinnamon may lead to a decrease in its vitamin C and carotenoid content. 3. Consume between 1 to 6 grams of cinnamon a day to experience the health benefits from cinnamon. Depending on the reason for taking cinnamon therapeutically, some researchers believe that as little as ½ teaspoon to 1 teaspoon (2 to 4 grams) of ground cinnamon (either pre-ground or hand ground from a stick) provides enough of a benefit. Here are some ways to consume cinnamon: * Cinnamon can be baked into a dish or sprinkled on top of food. * Eating raw cinnamon may have a harsh taste and may be more palatable when mixed with food or drinks. * While mixing cinnamon in cold drinks or food provides the same health benefits as mixing it with hot dishes, cold food does not absorb the spice and may be more difficult to consume. 4. Add cinnamon to warm drinks to reduce cold and flu effects. Cinnamon’s oils and nutrient composition can reduce the symptoms of the virus. * Add one to two teaspoons of ground cinnamon to a steaming hot cup of green tea or cider. Add lemon juice to help combat a respiratory infection. * Add one to two teaspoons of ground cinnamon to your coffee before brewing. It gives the coffee a nice cinnamon flavor and is an easy way to incorporate cinnamon into your diet. * A dash or two of cinnamon added to soups such as lentil or black bean may add an exotic flavor, plus provide the warming goodness may bring relief to those feeling under the weather. 5. Use cinnamon as a post-meal digestive aid. If you experience heartburn or indigestion following a meal, cinnamon might help you as it can stimulate a weak digestive system. Try a cinnamon tea after a meal. 6. Season a high carb food with cinnamon to lower the impact it will have on blood sugar levels. Research shows that cinnamon slows the rate at which the stomach empties after meals, lowering blood sugar after eating. A study conducted at Malmo University Hospital examined how 14 subject’s stomachs emptied after eating rice pudding laced with cinnamon. Scientists concluded that the rice pudding lowered the gastric emptying rate from 37% to 34.5% and reduced blood sugar levels after eating. * A study published in 2009 suggests that taking/eating cinnamon twice a day for 90 consecutive days can improve blood sugar levels. * If you have diabetes, consult with your physician about the impact of cinnamon on your levels.	.

Apply liquid enzyme detergent to stains prior to washing. If you spilled soup over your white t-shirt, or noticed the armpit sweat stains after wearing it, attack those spots immediately without letting them set. Rub some liquid enzyme detergent on the stained area, and let your t-shirt wait for 15 minutes or more before washing it with your laundry. * Read the description on the detergent bottle to ensure that it includes different enzymes designed to fight dirt. 2. Presoak your discolored whites with washing soda in hot water. If your white shirts lost their brightness or got discolored, put them in a bucket full of hot water and ½ cup of washing soda. Let them sit for as long as you can, up to a day, and throw them in the washer. * This powdered mineral soap will help brighten your whites. 3. Remove adamant stains with a presoak of lemon juice, salt, and washing powder. Another way to remove spots that are resisting traditional washing techniques is to prepare a hot water soak with 1 tablespoon of salt, the juice of 3 lemons, and ¼ cup of washing powder. Have your clothes in the presoak for 45 minutes, and then rinse them for a few times. 4. Rub sweat marks with baking soda and lemon. To counter the yellowing of whites due to perspiration, pour 1 tablespoon of baking soda onto the sweat area. Cut a lemon in half, and rub its cut side onto the same spot. Let it sit for 15 minutes, and wash as normal. * This method works for rust stains as well, except letting the cloth sit overnight might be better. The next day, rinse it with cold water, since hot water might let the rust set instead. Repeat if the stain persists. 5. Attack a red wine spill with salt and club soda. Red wine stains on a nice white shirt can look especially alarming, but if you handle the stain immediately, you might have a shot at salvaging your shirt! Pour salt onto the spot so it absorbs the moisture. Wait for a while, around 10 minutes or until the salt seems to impact the stain, and scrape the salt off.	.

Make sure everything is neat and tidy. As any college student will tell you, working in an untidy environment will only lead to distraction. make sure you have all of the pens, pencils, rulers, books you need for class. * Don't be ashamed to be too smart or to get a tutor. Tons of smart kids get picked on but it always pays off in the end. Also, don't be afraid to get a tutor because getting a tutor doesn't mean you aren't smart, it just means you need a little help and that you are learning at a right pace for you, which is perfectly ok. * It's not about how long you study, its about how well you study. Skimming a book for five hours doesn't help as much as reading your notes and the book for two hours. * When taking tests, you have to relax. Easier said than done? Remember - you have all of the answers in your head already! The only challenge is getting them out! Your first instinct is nearly always correct. Don't go back and change answers. If you are really not sure, skip it and come back later. * Take your time! A 120 question test you are given 1 hour for allows you 30 seconds per question. 30 seconds is forever (in 30 seconds, you can make a bathroom run, grab a drink and snack and still make it back to the couch before the next commercial starts)! Many of the questions will take far less than 30 seconds, so apply the balance to a tougher question. * If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask the teacher! You have the right to learn. * Do not procrastinate. Study well in advance of deadlines. This will allow you the luxury of breaks between study sessions and to study with friends once in awhile. * Look to the future, and make sure you see what the benefits of actually studying are. * Study with a friend as much as possible. Plan a weekend study sessions, or weekday sessions and help each other. This tends to work best when you are in the same class and not just with the same teacher - one class can be further ahead than the other. * Sometimes it helps if you reward yourself if you have gotten good grades maybe ask your parents if you can get some money, get a new phone, or whatever your parents agree to. * Having a small goal also helps. Instead of having your goal being get straight A's maybe get an A in a subject you normally don't get an A in. Or even set a goal of B-'s or better, then work your way up. *	There are sometimes things in there that the teacher didn't mention or you didn't hear.

Take notes on everything, except novel study. For most courses in middle school and high school and junior/community college, most of what is on the tests and homework will be discussed in the class. If your teacher draws a diagram on the board, copy that down - it can help you remember the information. Don't just copy what they write on the board, either: take extensive notes on everything. Most of the time in middle school though the teachers will probably take it easy and ask you to copy it down or give you specific instructions. Still, if you want to get the best marks, then copy it down. Notes should be short, and if possible get pens with colored ink because it aids the memory, as do pencils that smell good. These are useful and fun tricks that help with note taking and studying. plus they help in all around remembering as long as it is ok with the teacher. 2. Calculate how much of your grade a project is worth. Prioritize. You won't get a high score if you don't aim for one. Some schools have an online place where you can check your grades whenever you want. Utilize this and make sure that you have a username and password from your teacher. If not ask your teacher for your grade, you can average it yourself if you're desperate, or wait until the next progress report. 3. Homework comes first over everything else: set yourself goals and make sure you reach them before you go out and party. Social life is important too, but make sure your work comes first. But don't become a social outcast because that is as unhealthy as bad grades. Keep the grades up and have a social life. When you get a bad grade just think that you can still bring it up in the future, so don't worry. Try to do your best and most importantly ask a teacher for help if you need it! You don't need to worry because things can only get better. * If you are currently unpopular, spend a little time during things like lunch, classwork buddies, and other group or partner opportunities to get to talk to people. Communication is always key for getting to know people. As long as you look decent, have a good personality and take good care of your personal hygiene, getting yourself out there is all you really need. * Usually, most people already have buddies and cliques so finding a group is going to be hard, especially if you're a newbie. Just relax and don't be too desperate for friends. Friends will come when you feel like it. 4. With homework, don't travel into unknown territory, use your notes to answer what the teacher is asking for: If you see something that you're not sure is true, or that you're not sure your teacher will agree with, don't try it. Do it correctly, checking to make sure you have no mistakes, and you can't mess up. * Look over your homework in detail at least once before you turn it in, and if you're uncertain about something ask your teacher! 5. With tests, take the notes and make a study guide. Look in the textbook and add anything not in your notes, do not omit anything.	Use memory tricks. If you know it all, then make yourself do an essay on tricky stuff, like really understanding the thing. Do a problem with one, or two problems, not omitting anything of any type. Make sure you did it right. Ask your teacher if you can do an essay or extra sheet of problems for extra credit. If she says yes, hand it in the next day. If she hands it back before the test, you'll see your mistakes and be able to fix them

Start with condoms. Condoms can be obtained easily and for free at clinics like Planned Parenthood, in university dorms, and various kinds of health centers. Best of all, you do not need a prescription from a doctor. * Condoms are an effective form of birth control and prevent pregnancy 98% of the time if they are used correctly. Condoms are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and many other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like herpes or chlamydia when they are used consistently and correctly. * This type of birth control does require a responsible partner who is willing to help you prevent an unplanned pregnancy. * Websites like http://www.condomfinder.org/find.php can help you find places near you, anywhere in the US, that give out free condoms. Some websites list sites only in a certain area or are for teens only. 2. Contact your health department. Depending on where you live, your local health department may have a clinic that offers free or sliding scale services. Some clinics will offer birth control at a reduced price. Other clinics will help you apply for programs that allow you to get free health care, including birth control. The healthcare workers at the clinic will tell you what methods are available free. * Some states also offer free forms of permanent sterilization (vasectomy or tubal ligation) for low-income citizens. 3. Visit your health center on campus. Health centers on college campuses often offer free condoms for students. Sometimes they even offer free birth control pills or other forms of contraception for students. If you are a college student, speak to a doctor or nurse at your student health clinic to discuss which forms of birth control are available through student health insurance, or for free from the health center. 4. Apply for The Family Planning Benefit Plan. After the Affordable Care Act (ACA) went into effect in 2010, some states gained access to funds that would allow them to provide free birth control to qualifying women and men. * If you are uninsured, have a limited income, or qualify for Medicaid, this is a good option. * Each state is different in terms of what services the plan offers. In general, this option does give you access to a variety of birth control methods like an intrauterine device (IUD), a diaphragm, or getting your tubes tied.	.

Prepare for a bull market when prices are still falling during a bear market.

Bull markets tend to begin abruptly when things appear gloomiest, prices are in free fall, with no light at the end of the tunnel. When fear, pessimism, and pain reach their maximum, a bottom is reached, and a bull market begins. 2. Early in a bull market, when prices have just started to bounce back from the bottom, buy all kinds of stocks, but preferentially load up on the ones that have fallen the most during the bear market, typically the lower quality, cyclical stocks (such as Alcoa and Dow Chemicals). Lower quality stocks tend to have higher debt and lower margins and cyclical stocks are dependent on the business cycle, so they tend to be hardest hit in a recession and will bounce back much more dramatically when the recession ends.	During the early phase of a bull market, only a few forward looking investors will believe things will get better and are willing to take new positions. As the outlook turns just a little less depressing, the market will start to move up from the bargain hunting.

Prepare for a bull market when prices are still falling during a bear market. Because bear markets are invariably followed by bull markets, it is important to raise cash and keep a handy wish list of stocks with target prices to buy, before a bull market begins. Bull markets tend to begin abruptly when things appear gloomiest, prices are in free fall, with no light at the end of the tunnel. When fear, pessimism, and pain reach their maximum, a bottom is reached, and a bull market begins. Here are things you can do to prepare for the birth of a bull market: * Save as much as you can. Cut down your discretionary spending, and raise as much cash as possible. * Sell bonds and other fixed income investments, so you can take advantage of the high returns of stocks in a bull market. * Sell gold when the Dow/gold ratio is well below the historic average of around 20:1. * Have plenty of cash deposited into a stock brokerage account, so you are ready to buy stocks once the bear market ends and a bull market begins. * Watch for a bull market to begin in the depth of a recession, when everything is still in free fall, and the economic outlook appears the darkest. If you wait till a recession is officially over, you would most likely miss a great portion of the bull market's gains. 2. Early in a bull market, when prices have just started to bounce back from the bottom, buy all kinds of stocks, but preferentially load up on the ones that have fallen the most during the bear market, typically the lower quality, cyclical stocks (such as Alcoa and Dow Chemicals). Lower quality stocks tend to have higher debt and lower margins and cyclical stocks are dependent on the business cycle, so they tend to be hardest hit in a recession, and will bounce back dramatically when the recession ends. Load up in stocks that belong to the hardest hit industries and sectors during the bear market, for example, the financial sector in 2008 and 1991.	If small cap stocks have fallen more than large cap stocks, buy small caps. If international stocks have fallen more than domestic stocks, buy international stocks. If value stocks have fallen more than growth stocks, buy value stocks. During the early phase of a bull market, only a few forward looking investors will believe things will get better and are willing to take new positions. As the outlook turns just a little less depressing, the market will start to move up from the bargain hunting.

A normal, healthy relationship is built from mutual support. If your potential partner continually curses or often expresses words of anger, take this as a red flag and proceed into the relationship with utmost caution.

An abuser may often question you who you were talking to or who you are going with, gets jealous of the time you spent with others, check you from time to time, ask a friend to watch you or even prohibit you to go with some people. They may also accuse you of flirting with others for a very shallow basis. 3. Controlling Behavior.

The person is not doing this on purpose, they are not trying to hurt you, and try not to take the symptoms personally. Anorexia can make a person lie, be deceptive, try to hide their symptoms, and be defensive and argumentative. This is a way of the person to protect their anorexia. The person's thoughts are delusional, and they truly believe what the anorexia tells them. So try not to get into a power struggle.   * Support healthy eating. When a person is not eating as a sourse of control, giving them chips or high fat food items isn't going to help.	.

Brush your hair when it is DRY (brushing wet hair damages it!), with a solid, plastic brush. 5. You can also stir 1 egg into 2 cups of milk and then dip as much of your hair as you can.

As an alternative, wash your hair and let it air dry. Brush it towards your back (so there is no part).	Insert pins on both sides until the only hair left out is in the back.

Not only are you more likely to get a girl that shares interest, but you will feel more comfortable approaching or talking to them in a familiar environment. 3.

Think of it as a normal night. Do the same things you always do in your bedtime routine: brush your teeth, read a book, chat to the dog etc. 2. Relax! If you are just jumping up and down and feeling hyperactive, you need to calm down; you're only feeding a build-up of excitement that it'll be hard to come down from. Try taking a hot bath. Relax and just close your eyes. Squirt bath toys at imaginary targets - anything to keep you relaxing in the bath. 3. Get into a comfortable sleeping position. This is important for anytime you try to get to sleep. See some of the related wikiHows in this article for some more ideas on helping you to fall asleep. Or visit the whole category on Better Sleeping. 4. Try not to think about Christmas. It may be hard, but try it! Think of a best friend or think of your favorite song, etc. Maybe write a song, a poem or a play. 5. Relax. Breathe slowly. Count sheep. Any of these methodical, centering and calming methods will help to move you out of being too excited into a calmer state, which may help you to feel sleepy. 6. Don't keep on peeking into the living room. This might spoil any surprises and will also keep you - well, very awake! 7. Try exercising. Although this sounds silly, exercise can help to calm you down. See how many push -ups, crunches, jumping jacks you can do in your room. Only do this for 30 minutes though; you don't want to stay up too late. Exercising is a great way to help you feel physically tired, so your body will want to sleep. Better still, it will take your mind off Christmas for a little while. 8. Lie in bed and say this in your head: ""Relax my toes. Relax my arch. Relax my heel."" It might sound corny but it really does work through the power of suggestion. Make sure to work all the way up to your head. Even keeping up the effort of concentration on doing this is a great distraction. 9. Drink warm milk, or hot herbal tea. It is very soothing and calming to drink. 10. Put on the tidy gear. If you know you are going to be video-taped in the morning, prepare your best set of PJ's. You don't want everybody to remember you wearing that raggy ole' t-shirt and a pair of shorts on Christmas morning, do you?"	.

Some good Christmas movies that play a lot during Christmastime include: * A Christmas Story, The Polar Express, Elf, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, A Charlie Brown Christmas, A Christmas Carol, It's A Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, The Santa Clause, Frosty the Snowman, Home Alone 1 & 2, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. * Get a glass of water. Drink it slowly and try to think of nothing. * Limit the sweets after 2 or 3 o'clock in the day. You will have plenty of time to snack Christmas day! * Read a boring book to induce sleepiness; read an exciting one to get lost in and to help take away the urgency of thinking about Christmas things. * Try lying in bed and pretending it is time to get up. Ask yourself how tired you feel and if you'd really like some more sleep. Usually the answer is that you want more sleep first. * Don't consume large amounts of caffeine! * stay up to watch a Christmas special or a movie.	.

Think of it as a normal night. Do the same things you always do in your bedtime routine: brush your teeth, read a book, chat to the dog, etc. A technique, that, strange as it sounds, is to play a quiet game you can play alone (or with an also hyper and excited friend/ sibling) is Mad Libs, in bed. 2. Relax! If you are just jumping up and down and feeling hyperactive, you need to calm down; you're only feeding a build-up of excitement that it'll be hard to come down from. Try taking a hot bath. Relax and just close your eyes. Squirt bath toys at imaginary targets - anything to keep you relaxing in the bath. Think about how, the sooner you relax and fall asleep, the sooner it will be Christmas Day. 3. Get into a comfortable sleeping position. Try and stay still, don't move at all and you will become tired. This is important for anytime you try to get to sleep. See some of the related wikiHows in this article for some more ideas on helping you to fall asleep. Or visit the whole category on Better Sleeping. 4. Try not to think about Christmas. It may be hard, but try it! Think of a best friend or think of your favorite song, video game, etc. Maybe write a song, a poem or a play. 5. Relax. Breathe slowly. Count sheep. Any of these methodical, centering and calming methods will help to move you out of being too excited into a calmer state, which may help you to feel sleepy. 6. Don't keep on peeking into the living room. This might spoil any surprises and will keep you - well, very awake! 7. If you have a pet, snuggle up with him or her. If the pet is big enough to fit in your bed (or wherever you are sleeping), try to fall asleep. It helps you to sleep when you have someone else in the room with you. It will make you fall asleep a bit faster. 8. Try exercising. Although this may seem counter-intuitive, exercise can help to calm you down. See how many push-ups, crunches, or jumping jacks you can do in your room. Exercise only for thirty minutes though; you don't want to stay up too late. Exercising is a great way to help you feel physically tired, so your body will want to sleep. Better still, it will take your mind off Christmas for a little while. 9. Lie in bed and say this in your head: ""Relax my toes. Relax my arch. Relax my heel."" It might sound corny but it really does work through the power of suggestion. Make sure to work all the way up to your head. Even keeping up the effort of concentration on doing this is a great distraction. 10. Drink warm milk or at least some eggnog. The milk provides calcium, magnesium, and L-tryptophan, which can help you sleep. You can also try hot herbal tea; it is very soothing and calming to drink. 11. Put on the tidy gear. If you know you are going to be videotaped in the morning, prepare your best set of PJ's. You don't want everybody to remember you wearing that raggedy old t-shirt and a pair of shorts on Christmas morning, do you? Don't forget to brush your hair in the morning before galloping downstairs! 12. Read a book. It can be about Christmas, although it doesn't really matter. Try reading a school text book... a really boring one, of your least favourite subject."	.

Wash your whole body with Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, or another medicated body wash with an active ingredient of 2% salicylic acid, concentrating on the areas with pimples. Wait a minute or so before rinsing to get rid of all the oil, and to let the medicine sink in and do its work. 2. Exfoliate by using an abrasive sponge (Buf-Puf is one brand name) or a loofa. Don't scrub too hard, or you'll increase irritation. 3. Moisturize with an oil-free, medicated lotion, such as Clean & Clear Dual Action Moisturizer. Alternatively, use a non-medicated lotion, but be sure that it is guaranteed to be non-comedogenic. This is necessary because salicylic acid dries out your skin. 4. Spot treat with acne medication cream. Since you are already using salicylic acid to wash and moisturize, use a different medicine for spot treatment, such as 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. Do not use 5% or 10% benzoyl peroxide if you have extremely sensitive skin, because this will increase irritation. If you're sensitive to benzoyl peroxide, a 10% sulfur solution may work for you instead. 5. Wear loose clothes. Ensure any material touching your back is clean, and if possible, made of cotton, which removes sweat from your skin. 6. If you wear a bra it is extremely important it should be clean, try to wear a fresh one each day.	If possible, wear a strapless bra as this reduces redness on your shoulder blades amazingly quickly. If you have sensitive skin, the laundry detergent you use may irritate your skin, try switching to a brand that will be easier on your skin.

Create an administrator account, and keep the password secret. Administrator accounts on any device - computer, tablet, phone, or so forth - prevent your child from installing or uninstalling software on the device without your knowledge. It also prevents them from changing settings on the parental controls if parental controls have been installed. Make sure the password is something hard to guess (so don't use a pet's name, a birthday, or anything else that your child could easily figure out), and don't let your child know what it is. * Don't write the password anywhere in the computer, even if it's in the administrator account. A child with good enough computer skills would know how to find this, even without signing in to the administrator account. 2. Limit screen time. Spending too much time in front of screen is not good for one's brain and eyes. For young children, one or two hours of screen time per day is enough. Set a limit on how much time your child can spend on the computer, and enforce it. You don't want your kid staring at a screen all day. * The only exception to your child's time limit should be if they're trying to do their homework and have run out of time. However, you may want to do this sparingly, as many children and teens put off their homework and then rush to get it done at the last minute. Consider limiting this to when they have a big assignment only. * It would be wise not to place a television or a computer in your kid's room.	.

Determine always the rates that the card can offer. These consist of the price of the card and the per minute charge of your call. Choose a card that has a lower rate compared to others since they still can offer you better card quality.	You will sacrifice the quality of your card with the price. Upon receiving your card, you are provided with important numbers like the local access numbers and toll-free access numbers. When you use the previous number, you will get lower per minute rate and you will enjoy longer calls. When the latter number is used, you will have a more reliable call and a better chance to having a clear talking with the other party. Just be careful of the hidden charges imposed in some cards. These are the cards that have the lowest rates but there are maintenance fee, connection fee and service fee charged to your card whenever you make a call. These fees lessen your talk time and the actual minutes will be reduced. Take note also of the billing increments in your card. The usual rounding is one minute for the time of your call that did not reach the next minute. You pay for one minute charge even if you consume less than the next calling minute.

Cry. Scream, act like a baby, throw tantrums. Kick, sob. At least do something to get out your anger. Cry until you don't have a single tear left. Get everything out. 2. One of the hardest parts about having a big fight with your best friend is that when you would normally turn to them when something awful happened, you can't. Look around you- make a list of who truly cares about you. Think family, friends, teachers, classmates, co-workers, neighbors, religious leaders, etc. These people care about you. 3. Talk to someone. If you feel like you can't talk to anyone, get a teddy bear. Teddy bears, unlike people, will never betray you, turn their back, or walk away. They will give you their undivided attention and a shoulder to cry on. Tell them everything, even those unpleasant details you wish you could just forget. 4. Write it all down. You could start from the day you met, or from the second she gave you the silent treatment. Just pick a place and go for it. 5. Think about the good times, the best memories you have of that person. Do the bad times really outweigh the good times? 6. For a day or two... or a week or two... or maybe a month, pamper yourself. Sit on the couch and eat chocolate. Watch TV until your eyes burn out. Take long, hot baths and use every bath oil you can buy. 7. Don't spend too much time grieving your loss. Remember the good things and acknowledge the bad, but remember that there's more to life than that person. 8. Eventually, you have to get back to real life. It's okay to grieve, and you probably will.	It'll only make it worse.

So if you're ready for a rotty, then know you can't let them fight. 2. Be prepared for the food bill. Rottweilers can eat a lot more then an average dog. That's why they're so colossal! Look below for how much they should eat depending on their weight: * 10 lbs: 1 cup per day * 10-20lbs: 1 1/2- 2 1/2 cups per day. * 25-50lbs: 2 1/4- 3 3/4 cups per day. * 50-75lbs: 3 3/4- 5 cups per day. * Over 75 lbs: 5- 8 cups per day. 3. Pour water in a dogs bowl every time they run out. Because living things need water and they can't get too much. So just know dogs need water regularly. 4. Make sure you're ready to walk your dog(s) everyday! If you not that kind of person, a rottweiler's not for you! These breeds are very active so they need to be moving! 5. Think of pros and cons for this breed in your own home. Like these: * Rottys can bark very loud and A LOT! So be ready for that * Rottys can be really loving and make you feel better. * etc. 6. Rottys are very pulchritudinous dogs. But they can shed. So you need to be ready for tons of grooming and vacuuming.	They all have a different personality. They are great guard dogs! These are the types of dogs you should get!

Install_Drywall.txt	Begin_Revision	0.957	## Steps	1889	Also screed some mud over any small imperfections in the drywall that may occur during installation such as missed nail / screw holes .	### Mudding and Taping Drywall	2010	Screed some mud over any small imperfections in the drywall that may occur during installation such as missed nail / screw holes .	<delete><Also><1>|||<replace><screed><2><Screed><1>	True	"Steps  1. Drywall typically comes in 4'x8' sheets and is normally installed horizontally but can be installed vertically if desired. Larger 4'x12' sheets are available however they are hard to work with unless you are a professional with a few extra hands. These larger sheets tend to break easily during transport to the job site but are great because the larger sheets mean fewer joints to tape. 2. Thicknesses range from 1/4"" - 5/8"" with 1/2"" being the most popular. The 1/4"" sheets are often used as overlays to existing drywall and are not intended to be used in new construction. Check your local building code for requirements in your area. 3. Composition is another factor when selecting drywall as there are various moisture resistant products commonly called 'green rock' designed for installation in high moisture areas such as garages and bathrooms. Check your local building supply store before committing to purchase. Green rocking the whole house may be overkill but is great because of it's moisture resistant properties. 4. Prepare the wall for your new drywall by removing all old drywall, nails, screws and anything else that will prevent the new drywall sheets from laying flat on the studs. 5. Now is a good time to inspect and repair hidden damage such as loose blocking, moisture damage, termites, etc. Don't be surprised to find steel studs instead of wood. This is really a good thing since steel has many good qualities such as added strength, termite-proof, and fire retardant. The only difference is that you have to use drywall screws instead of nails, and that is better anyway. 6. Inspect insulation that is stapled to the studs. Use Kraft tape to repair tears in the paper backing to maximize your energy efficiency. 7. Use triple expanding foam to seal cracks and gaps on exterior walls. 8. Be advised that drywall has a mud cavity along the length wise seams to give the mud a place to adhere without forming a mound that will be unsightly on your finished wall. 9. Measure the wall where you would like to install drywall. Most likely you will have to cut some pieces. When cutting drywall, use a razor knife and score a line on one side of the drywall paper. Place your knee on the opposite side of the cut and quickly pull the drywall piece towards you while at the same time pushing your knee outward to snap the drywall in a clean line. Then simply use your razor knife to cut the remaining paper along the newly formed crease. 10. Cut the pieces being very careful, because the knife or saw that you use always somehow seems to want to go off the line. I recommend using a straight edge as a guide for the razor knife. Remember that you don't have to press any harder than required to cut one side of the paper since you will snap the drywall along your cut line. 11. Use a hand drywall saw to make cuts along irregular openings such as arches. 12. A good practice when installing drywall over protruding pipes is to place the drywall against the pipe and lightly tap with a flat block of wood to dimple the back, then pull the drywall away and use a drywall circle cutter or drywall hole saw and cut a perfect hole that should be much easier to finish out than if you punch out a large hole that requires 3-4 coats of mud to finish. 13. Locate the studs with a stud finder if they are not visible. Don't trust that your studs will all be on 16"" or 24"" centers. Mine were often 1/2"" off in either direction most likely due to sloppy carpentry work by the builder. A good idea is to run a length of masking tape along the floor while you have the studs exposed and mark the center line of each stud with a high visibility marker. 14. Make sure to use a spring loaded drywall screw dimpler since they are designed to automatically countersink each drywall screw to precisely the same depth before ratcheting the screw bit as a sign to quit and back off the drill. 15. Have someone help you hold the drywall on the wall, and using the drill, install the screws in the at approx 8"" centers on the vertical studs. Extra screws may help in some situations however they are usually overkill and will require extra mudding and sanding that will detracting on the overall finish. 16. When possible, install the screws closer to the edges that will be trimmed so that the screw heads will be covered by baseboard or door frame trim. 17. Use at least a 6"" drywall knife to apply a liberal amount of mud to each seam. 18. Have your drywall tape pre-cut and lightly dampened with clean water. Don't need to soak it down too much. 19. Recommend avoiding the perforated and fiber tapes as they don't produce a flawless finish and require gobs of extra mud and sanding to get the job done right. 20. Put drywall tape over the joint you just applied the mud, then use your 6"" or 8"" drywall putty knife to flatten the tape by starting at one end and pulling towards you to hate other end in one smooth motion. 21. DO NOT REAPPLY THE MUD THAT IS LEFT ON YOUR BLADE. It is critical to clean your blade after each swipe to ensure a professional finish. Dip it in water in between each swipe and wipe it on the mud tray edge to ensure a clean application. The putty knife will collect small dust particles that will cause streaks in your finish which is why you will want to discard the excess mud after each swipe. 22. Inspect your recently taped joint for air bubbles. Wet your blade and flatten then out with another swipe if needed. 23. Repeat for each joint until all joints are taped. 24. Don't apply any mud over freshly taped joints! Allow them to thoroughly dry for one day between coats unless you are using hot mud that will dry in an hour. A great idea is to use pink mud that dries white indicating it is ready for another coat. 25. For corner beads you may want to use a corner tool that is available for both inside and outside corners to give your job a professional finish. 26. Apply at least 2-3 more coats using a slightly wider putty knife for each application letting it dry between each coat. It will bubble if you rush it! 27. Don't forget to apply a swipe coat over each screw. You shouldn't notice any edges after screening the mud over a joint line or screw dimple. Make sure to hold the blade flat against the drywall and pull towards you in smooth but firm strokes. Practice on an old piece of drywall to refine your technique. 28."	.

Once your child has earned a spanking take him or her for a walk, and talk calmly with them, explaining what they did wrong, and why it's wrong better choices they could have made instead, etc. This should be an open conversation in which the child can ask questions to understand exactly what is expected of him or her. The walk also gives you a chance to clear your head and calm down. As the conversation is coming to a close meander back to the area where the spanking will occur. This should be private away from onlookers. 2. Once you have reached your destination and have come to a clear understanding announce that consequence of the child's actions will be a spanking. (ex. ""Because you chose to cheat on your math test and as we just discussed cheating is wrong, I am going to give you a spanking to teach you not to do that again.) 3. Tell the child to bring you the correction tool necessary. 4. Once he or she handed you the implement direct him or her to the saw horse. He or she should stand facing it with his or her back to you. 5. Instruct him or her to take his or her pants down below his or her bottom, leaving the underwear up. 6. Instruct the child to bend over the saw horse. 7. Advise the child that you are going to spank them and they should remain in position, not attempt to block or otherwise resist the punishment, and count the number of licks out loud and refrain from any other talking, and that failure to do so will result in a prolonged spanking. 8. Gently ask them if they are ready and when given an affirmative answer begin spanking them. 9. Licks should be given with a full arm swing, land squarely on the buttocks and be audible. They should be uncomfortable but not leave lasting marks. If the child gets out of position tell him or her to resume it and wait patiently for him or her to follow instructions. 10. Spank him or her the prescribed number of licks. If the child did not follow instructions during the spanking remind him or her of that and give five extra licks for his or her defiance 11."	.

Maintain your hair properly. Follow the guidelines below for some help on how to do so. * If you have oily or messy hair with dandruff, you should attend to it before the scalp becomes corrupted by the dandruff, which will cause more hair to fall out. * For messy hair, use Herbal Essence shampoo and conditioner. Apply the conditioner to the ends of your hair and let it stay for 15 minutes. Doing this will soak your hair and make the scalp to prevent dandruff. Rinse your hair after applying it. Then add shampoo and rinse it again. Use a blow dryer to dry your hair. Move it around and keep it at least away from your hair. (Be sure to keep it on a low setting) 2. Keep your face clean. Facial cleansers like Neutrogena, Clearasil, or Body Shop are good products to wash your face before going to bed and early in the morning. This reduces dirt and polishes the inner cells that make your skin sparkle and shine. 3. Take care of your lips. Using Chapstick does not mean that your lips are blushed with a lot of moisture. Instead, use fruited lip balm, or before sleeping, apply a light layer of olive oil on your lips! 4. Care for your facial skin. Make a simple homemade facial oil using rosewater and glycerin. In an empty bottle add 1/4 cup of glycerin and 1 cup rosewater. Stir it and apply every night! 5. Get a proper manicure! You should have neat and clean nails! Do not make your nails too long; medium is enough! Snip them carefully, taking care not to cut to deep down. 6. Take a shower shower every morning or night. It will keep dirt and grease away, and will make you feel fresh and clean! 7. Use makeup very lightly! Add concealer according to your skin tone, add eyeliner on top of your eyes, add some shimmering lip gloss, and always use light colored eyeshadow such as pink, silver, or purple. 8. Use deodorant while going out on a date or in public. Make sure that it's not too strong, because a strong scent is sure to keep people away.	Also,do not forget to shave the hair.

Check for underground utilities. Before digging up the backyard have your utility companies locate and mark underground lines. Local agencies vary but information on who to call in your specific area is usually available by calling 811. This will connect you to your local agencies. Don't make the mistake of assuming that there are no utilities in the area you are digging! It's better to be safe than sorry. 2. Mark off the patio area. Measure your patio dimensions and mark them on the ground with stakes at each corner of the plot. Wrap a string or thin rope around the stakes to outline the patio's perimeter. This will give you a good idea of how the patio will fit into the yard and it will make sure that you are only prepping the ground where the patio will actually be. *	If all of your strings are level, then you can measure down from the string at every step and your measurements will be based on the same starting point.

Buy extra boxes of your favorite period products. Make sure that you have products that work for your light days and your heavy days. You want to be prepared for any stage of your period. Sanitary napkins and tampons take a long time to expire as long as they are stored in a cool, dry place, so it is okay for you to have several extra boxes in your home. 2. Purchase several opaque waterproof bags. Sanitary napkins and tampons can be ruined by moisture. Moisture can ruin the wrappers and make the products unhygienic. Look for waterproof bags where you can store your period supplies safely. An opaque bag will allow you to walk to the bathroom without showing off your period supplies to your classmates. * If you cannot find an opaque waterproof bag, consider doubling up. Place a small,clear, waterproof plastic bag inside a small opaque bag. You will get the waterproofing benefits as well as your desired privacy. 3. Hang on to extra pocket change. A few schools are starting to provide free menstrual products for their students.	Hold on to extra change in case you need to use one of these dispensers in an emergency.

Purchase India ink. It absolutely has to be India ink, because any other ink has the potential to have toxins and be rejected by (or possibly poison) your body. India ink is carbon-based, which is why it isn't generally rejected. Purchase a fine-pointed needle and make sure you have rubbing alcohol on hand. You'll also need a permanent marker (Preferably a fine-point Sharpie). 2. With the pen, mark out your design on your skin. 3. Sterilize the area to be tattooed with the rubbing alcohol. This may smear the Sharpie some, but not enough to erase it entirely. 4. Sterilize the needle. You can boil it for a few minutes to ensure it's clean. 5. Pour some India ink into a small, sterile dish of some kind. 6. Dip the tip of the needle into the ink, and push it into your skin. It'll leave a small dot. Continue doing this until your design is complete. There may be some blood, and that's okay-- but it should be very little blood. Don't push the needle in too far. All the ink needs to do is get far enough into your skin that it is in between layers. This can only be done by feel, which is why you should do it yourself and not let anyone else do it for you. It will hurt some. 7. After each mark, take a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol and run it over the area to wash away the extra ink and keep the skin clean. 8. The small marks each needle-point leaves in your skin will expand a very small amount, hopefully eliminating all spaces in between.	.

Fashion: Most middle schoolers wear Hollister, American Eagle, Abercrombie and Fitch, and Aeropostale.(Other stores are worn such as: Deb, Pac Sun, Rue 21, and other stores at your local mall/outlet mall) In sixth grade, you can get away with wearing clothing from the kids' Abercrombie or your school polos from Target, but in seventh grade and up, most people go to the adults' Abercrombie and Fitch. You can wear Limited Too (or the other name Justice) sometimes, but match it with stuff from other stores (Example: A Limited Too tank top under an American Eagle t-shirt with jeans). As far as shoes, most girls like to wear Converse sneakers or DC. You can get those at Target, or at a department store at a near-by mall, like macy's or something like that. Flip flops are also popular for girls in schools that allow them. Just make sure that you have attractive feet, like having cut and painted toe nails. 2. Lockers: Some schools don't have lockers, but most of them do, and you will need them. Try to have a place for everything. If you have a heavy backpack, put in on the bottom. Put coats and sweaters on the hangers. And put books and things you need for the day on the top shelf. Sometimes, you will have to share a locker, in which you must work that out with a locker partner. By the way, never dump things on the floor of your locker. You will be amazed that in April you still have that Christmas CD that you got for free from the school to be given to good old gramps on your top shelf (true story). 3. Homework: There is more homework than in elementary school. Homework should be done first thing when you get home. Right now, school is the most important thing in your life. Always try to get straight A's, although don't kill yourself trying. 4. School bus: School buses in real life are not like the ones in movies or on TV (Then again, nothing in real life is similar to what's on TV). Most buses are not fun. If your school lets you bring an iPod, then listen to it on the bus. If you can't bring an iPod, then bring a book to read or something. It's usually rather difficult to do homework when the bus is jumping up and down and there are people being annoying. If you do homework on the bus, then sit in the front because it's a less bumpy ride. Also, if you ride the bus, then you will probably need a cell phone.	It will make your trip to school more enjoyable.

Pay attention to her body language around you. If you ever touch her, does she touch you back or does she avoid contact? When you talk, does she lean towards you? Does she open her shoulders up to your when you’re talking or does she keep her distance and remained reserved? These aren’t foolproof ways of knowing that she does or does not like you, but they can help you get an idea. Some girls might be more comfortable messing around with and touching guys even if they don’t like them. 2. Watch for clues that she is trying to avoid you. If she avoids or finds excuses to get out of time that you would otherwise share together, she probably doesn’t like you. If she was thinking about how she liked you she would probably be making excuses to be around you more, not the other way around. Don’t take this as gospel – there is always the chance that she is really shy. However, if you find that she’s constantly scheduling her doctors appointments during the free period you have together that probably isn’t a good sign. 3. Observe if she flirts with other guys. She might not be interested in you if she flirts with other guys, but she might be trying to make you jealous so don’t immediately assume the worst. There’s also no way to know if she’s really flirting with the guy or just being friendly.	Again, if she’s really shy she may be more comfortable talking to guys that she doesn’t like versus someone she does – maybe you!

Don't purchase the door system until you have gone home to measure on the wall where you think you will install the door system. 2. Once you have determined the location and measured the wall, you will need to look for any obstructions on or in the wall (i.e. electrical outlets or switches, plumbing fixtures or any h.v.a.c. registers or ducts). Re routing existing fixtures on or in a wall can be time consuming so if you aren't up for this task, you may want to pick another location without any objects.	"A single french door system of say 3'0"" wide by 6'8"" high will have usually an (rough opening) dimension about 2"" added to the width and about an 1"" to an 1-1/2"" on the height of the door size. This is to allow space for the jamb or frame of the door system."

If you don't have Oracle Java installed on your system please see the following article, http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Oracle-Java-on-Ubuntu-Linux 2. First let's start by gathering up all your tools.Make sure you have Oracle Java installed on your Ubuntu Linux system. For this project it is imperative that you have Oracle Java and not OpenJDK installed on your system. If you do not have Oracle Java installed on your Ubuntu Linux system please reference the following article for the correct setup, http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Oracle-Java-on-Ubuntu-Linux 3. Second, you will need to obtain a copy of the NetBeans IDE with JavaFX support. It is best that you obtain the latest copy to ensure it has full support for JavaFX. You can obtain that from here http://netbeans.org/ Download the correct NetBeans IDE for your Ubuntu Linux system architecture.My suggestion is that you download the NetBeans IDE to /usr/local and install it by using this method. * Type/Copy/Paste: cd /home/your_user_directory/Downloads * Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s cp -r netbeans-7.1.2-ml-linux.sh /usr/local * Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s * Type/Copy/Paste: cd /usr/local/ * Type/Copy/Paste: chmod +x netbeans-7.1.2-ml-linux.sh * to make the Netbeans IDE executable for all users on the system * Type/Copy/Paste: ./netbeans-7.1.2-ml-linux.sh * To install netbeans to your system 4. Download JavaFX Beta SDK for Linux, you will need to obtain the JavaFX Beta SDK for Linux http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/downloads/devpreview-1429449.html 5. Select the correct JavaFX SDK for your system architecture(32-bit or 64-bit) * javafx_sdk-2_2_0-beta-b13-linux-i586-13_jun_2012.zip (32-bit) * javafx_sdk-2_2_0-beta-b13-linux-x64-13_jun_2012.zip (64-bit) 6. At this time, in order to obtain the JavaFX Beta SDK for Linux, you will be required to create and register an account with Oracle.com. If you don't you won't be able to obtain the JavaFX Beta 2.0 SDK 7. Download the JavaFX SDK, it will download to “/home/your user directory/Downloads * Type/Copy/Paste: cd /home/your_user_directory/Downloads * Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s cp -r javafx_sdk-2_2_0-beta-b13-linux-i586-13_jun_2012.zip /usr/local * Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s cp -r javafx_sdk-2_2_0-beta-b13-linux-x64-13_jun_2012.zip /usr/local * Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s chmod +x sudo -s cp -r javafx_sdk-2_2_0-beta-b13-linux-i586-13_jun_2012.zip /usr/local * Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s chmod +x sudo -s cp -r javafx_sdk-2_2_0-beta-b13-linux-x64-13_jun_2012.zip /usr/local 8.

Write about a passion. As you become familiar with your favorite magazines, you will see that they write about the same general topics each month. Think about which articles catch your attention the most, or if you have something new to say on the topic. Ask yourself the following brainstorm topics and see if it sparks any new ideas to help get you started! * Music. Did you favorite artist just release a new album? Do you think swearing in music lyrics should be allowed on the radio? Did a friend just introduce you to a cool new genre of music that you want other people to know about? * Makeovers. Did you have a great/awful makeover experience you can share? When you cut your hair did you find increased self-confidence? Do you friends always come to you for makeup advice? * School. Have you ever felt pressured to cheat on a test? Does your math teacher inspire you? Are you worried about leaving your friends for college? * Relationships. Did your best friend start dating your ex? Do you have a great relationship with you stepmom? Do you feel like you’re maturing faster than your friends? * Health/Fitness. Are you the captain of your soccer team? Do you help you parents cook dinner every night? Are you struggling to get enough sleep each night? 2. Consider your audience. Unlike your writing assignments for school when you’re writing for your teacher or another adult, your audience for a teen magazine is your peers. That doesn’t mean you can say whatever you want, but don’t try to sound older than you are. Your audience wants to read your story because you’re going through the same things they are. Use that connection and write a story that you would want to read! 3. Remember your grammar lessons. With texting and social media, we’ve gotten very used to shorthand writing, like “u” and “lol.” These are not appropriate for magazine writing. A good rule to remember, if your English teacher wouldn’t let you use it in a class essay, don’t put it in your magazine article. 4. Find your own voice! As you read, you’re going to find different writers who you enjoy more than others. While you may look up to these writers, let them inspire but not control your writing. If your reader wanted to read a story by J.K. Rowing, she can pick up one of her books, you want to show you’re your own person.	Keep it natural!

Get_Through_Menopause_Without_Any_Drugs_or_Pills.txt	Begin_Revision	0.857	## Steps	229	And , other things may begin happening to you as you move through menopause .	## Steps	267	Other things may begin happening to you as you move through menopause .	<delete><And><1>|||<delete><,><2>|||<replace><other><3><Other><1>	True	Steps  1. Be sure you see a doctor to ensure that what you are feeling isn't caused by an underlying medical condition. The signs of menopause can easily be misconstrued, since there is such a wide range of symptoms. Some people may get a few symptoms, or even none, while another may get all of them. Ask your doctor if going through menopause naturally is safe in your individual case. 2. Start a record keeping organizer once you have cleared the way with your doctor. You'll need to keep it for about 2 weeks. Monitor what you feel, and when you feel it the most. You dont have to know the name of the symptom, just the description you have for the feeling...i.e. squiggly feeling in legs, or, tingly knees, etc. Since this is your private description for your own records, only YOU need to be able to understand it. Write the date, time. description, and duration of each symptom. After 2 weeks of filling in your chart, you will have a viewable knowledge of what your working with, and be able to start working on each symptom separately. 3. Once you have compiled your list, make another list of symptoms, solutions tried, and solutions that worked. You may choose to first deal with the one that bothers you the most. In my case, it was restless legs. So, I read up on natural ways to soothe this problem, and utilized it in making the annoying feeling stop. The best thing I found for this problem was a hot shower, and then, at bedtime, I rubbed lotion on my feet, and on the top of my thighs. I also found that if it woke me in the middle of the night, another layer of lotion made it bearable enough to sleep. I then jotted it down, and moved on to the next symptom. I also found that working on one symptom at a time was much easier than trying to do them all. 4. Sometimes your symptom may be made bearable at best, while others may be cured, and its different for all women. Dont expect every symptom to just go away.	If they do, simply chart it as you did the others.

Don't move the same piece twice in the first 7 moves because this wastes time. 2. Make sure that your pieces are ""developed."" Remember that when we are talking about pieces in this context we are not talking about pawns. Pawns are more like the terrain you fight on, not the pieces you fight with. Make sure your pieces are not sitting on the back rank like wallflowers at a dance. Get them out there, first the knights and bishops, then what they call the ""heavy pieces,"" meaning the queen and the rooks. It's easy to find squares for the knights, they are quite nicely placed on toward the center on the first square they can legally move to, ""f3""and ""c3"" as white and ""f6""and ""c6"" for black. (see How to Read a Chess Game if you don't know what ""f3"" and ""f6"" refers to.) * Make sure you do develop your center pawns though, because these guys help you control the center, and they also allow you to develop your bishops. Try not to allow your opponent to kick your knights off their squares by pawn pushes. Place your bishops where they can control strong diagonals like ""c4"" for white and ""c5"" for black. Make sure you castle, so your king is safe and your rooks are lined up. Rooks like to be connected. Try not to place other pieces between them. 3. Attack your opponents pieces with gain of time. As you are developing your pieces always look for captures, look for tactics like skewers, forks and pins. But after that, if you don't find something, what to do? This is where a plan comes in. Of course you want to improve the position of your pieces. *"	Look to trade your weak pieces for your opponents strong ones. An example would be to trade a bishop that is on the same color as your center pawns for a knight that has an oupost. An outpost is a square far into enemy territory that cannot be kicked out by a pawn, and that is protected by one of his own pawns.

Halter_a_Horse.txt	Begin_Revision	0.741	### Haltering Your Horse	4945	For example , draft horses need halters specifically made for larger breeds .	### Haltering Your Horse	5022	Draft horses need halters specifically made for larger breeds .	<delete><For><1>|||<delete><example><2>|||<delete><,><3>|||<replace><draft><4><Draft><1>	True	Haltering Your Horse  1. Position the halter in the same direction as the horse's head. A halter needs to be slipped over your horse's head in a specific manner. Once you've reached the horse, position the halter in the same direction as the horse's head. The noseband of the halter should be facing the same direction as the horse is facing. 2. Loop the lead line over the horse's head. Once your halter is in the right position, loop the lead rope towards the bottom of the horse's neck. This will provide you some control if your horse gets impatient during the haltering process and tries to run away. 3. Guide the halter over the nose and ears. From here, gently guide the halter over the horse's nose. Slip the horse's nose through the nose band. Then, slip your right hand under the horse's throat. Use your right hand to place the crown piece behind his ears, gently bending his ears back as needed. Adjust the halter as necessary to make sure it's straight and not cutting into the horse's ears. 4. Buckle the halter. Once the halter is on, buckle up or snap up the crown piece. Hold the halter in place with your left hand. Use your right hand to buckle the end of the crown piece into the buckle on the left side of your horse's head. * Check to make sure the halter is not too tight. It should be tight enough that the horse cannot slip out of it. However, it should also be loose enough that the straps are not digging into the horse's skin. If it's too tight or too loose, you may need to use a different sized halter next time. 5. Reassure your horse as needed. Your horse may be nervous about being haltered. Reassure your horse as you go. Talk to him in a soothing voice and pet him if he seems agitated or upset. 6. Make sure the halter fits properly. You want to make sure you have the right sized halter. An ill-fitting halter can cause your horse pain. If the halter is cutting into the horse's skin or fur, you could resize the crown piece by adjusting the buckles. However, some halters may simply be too small for your horse. Go to a local tack shop and get a bigger halter if moving to the next notch on the buckle does not help. * You can measure a horse's head to find the right size halter. Use a measuring tape and place it midway between your horse's cheekbones and nostrils. Stretch the tape to the same point on the other side of your horse's head. Write down this measurement. This is the size noseband you need. * Place the end of the measuring tape directly under a horse's cheekbone. Stretch the tape to the cheekbone on the other side of his face. This measurement is how big of a crown piece you'll need. Then, place the tape several inches behind the horse's eye and stretch it near the top of his throat. Then, move the tape underneath this throat to the top of his throat on the other side of his face. This is how big the halter's throatlatch should be. * If you have a horse with special needs size-wise, you may need a particular type of halter.	If your horse has a narrow head, you may have to do some trial and error. Try halters from a variety of manufacturer's until you find a halter that fits.

Second, put the lightbulb in a socket, and twist in until the metal stops turning, but the glass slides. Then turn on the bulb over a bucket of water. As the filament heat the gas inside of the bulb, the pressure created by the expanding glass will blow the glass bulb off, intact. If this works, you will be left with a glass bulb, and a glowing filament that will shortly and safely burn out. Next, take the filament out of the socket by unplugging the lamp and removing the filament with pliers. The glass bulb should be washed out with water to remove the powder on the inside. 2. Third, fill the bulb with soil. Then, put 3 rings of glue around the bulb. this is to prevent the bulb from forming 1 continuous crack if dropped. 3.	Let dry overnight, and make sure to keep dry.

Bring your cat to the vet at least once a year. If not caught early, high blood pressure can cause severe damage to the eyes, kidneys, and other organs. Annual vet visits are the best way to diagnose high blood pressure before it causes any lasting medical issues. * Contact the vet immediately if you notice swollen or bloodshot eyes, lethargy, trouble breathing, decreased mobility, or any other unusual symptoms. 2. Have your cat tested for related conditions. Primary hypertension, or high blood pressure that’s not caused by another medical condition, is rare in cats. Typically, hypertension is related to heart disease, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, or another underlying issue. * Your cat’s vet will most likely order a complete blood count, thyroid hormone test, and other exams to identify any related conditions. 3. Have your cat’s liver and kidneys tested. Amlodipine should be used cautiously in pets with liver problems, so tell your cat’s vet if it’s ever been diagnosed with any issues. If you’re not sure about its liver function, ask the vet if they recommend any tests. * Amlodipine is often prescribed to cats with kidney disease, but it’s recommended that the kidneys be routinely monitored to rule out adverse side effects. If you’re unable to bring your cat in for follow-up care, ask the vet if they recommend an alternative medication. 4. Tell the vet if your cat takes any other medications. Amlodipine is often prescribed with other medications, especially when a cat is diagnosed with a secondary condition.	.

Allow for plenty of space. It is important that you avoid overstocking your tank. The general rule is that you should have room for one gallon of water for each inch of fish in your tank. So, a ten-gallon tank can safely accommodate ten one-inch-long fish. This is a very important rule to keep in mind if you are looking to care for schools of fish. * Overstocking your tank can lead to a build-up of toxic waste products. It will also necessitate additional cleanings. * Some larger species, such as full-grown goldfish, will require additional tank space. Fish that move around a great deal may also need extra room. 2. Go with either cold water or warm water fish. You need to choose fish that all thrive at right around the same temperature. You can accommodate only a few degrees’ difference in preferred temperatures or your fish will suffer.	Your tank equipment needs will also differ greatly as some fish require heaters and lights and others do not.

Construct a fence stretcher. Woven wire fencing can be tough to stretch, but constructing a fence stretcher can make it much easier. To make a fence stretcher, take two 2x4s, each of which is a little longer than the height of the woven fence you’re using. Drill three holes in each 2x4 at even intervals along the board. Place bolts in these holes. You will hook your woven fence over the bolts in order to stretch it by pulling on the board. * Use one 2x4 at each end of the section of woven fence you’re stretching. 2. Attach the end of the wire to the corner post. To attach the end of the post, remove a few of the vertical wires from your woven fence. Wrap these wires around the post and then weave them back into the fencing. Using a staple gun, secure the wires to the fence post. * When you’re buying wire, remember that the higher the wire’s gauge, the smaller the wire’s diameter. For instance, 12-gauge wire is heavier than 14-gauge wire. * Generally, you’ll want to use galvanized staples that are at least an inch and a half long. However, if you are using a harder wood for your posts, you may need a shorter staple. 3. Stretch the fence to the next corner post. Once you have one end of the wire attached to you first corner post, stand the woven wire on its end and unroll it along the outside of your fence line to the next corner post. Using your fence stretcher, stretch the fence slowly, applying pressure evenly to all your corner, brace, and line posts. Stretch the wire until the tension curves in the wire are about a third of the way straight. 4. Attach the wire to the fence posts. Starting at the end closest to the corner post you’ve already attached your wire to, secure the woven wire to your brace and line posts using a staple gun. Attach the wire at the top of the fence post first and work your way down the post, making sure to keep the wire pulled taut the whole time. * When you’re stapling your wire to your fence posts, drive the staples in slightly angled to the vertical axis of the post. This will help keep the wood from splitting. 5. Use wire clips to attach fencing to metal posts. If you’ve decided to use metal posts instead of wood, you’ll follow the same procedure for stretching the wire along your fence line.	Use these to secure your wire instead of staples.

The camera quality depends on what you plan to use your movie for; If you are just going to show it off to your friends the camera quality doesn’t have to be as good, but if you are submitting into a competition or film festival a higher quality camera would be better. 4. Find a set. The set you choose would depend on what kind of movie you plan to make. If you are making a movie about mountain bikers you would want to get into a forest, if you are making a movie about someone who has lost his glasses in his home you are going to need a house. 5. Find some actors. You are going to need a person to film with the camera. You could get your friends or acquaintances to act in the film for you, or you could hold auditions. 6. Shoot the movie. Using your story, camera, set and actors, start filming the movie. Remember that you need to portray all ideas with actions and facial expressions as you won’t be able to hear any talking. You can communicate freely between cast and crew with voice, as there will be no voice in the final movie. 7. Import your shots onto your computer. The methods of doing this can vary depending on what camera you are using and what outputs your computer has. You may need a cable or just a memory card. Save all your clips into a folder somewhere onto your computer and copy the song you’ll be using into that folder too. 8. Start editing your movie. Open up Windows Movie Maker or whatever movie editing program you have. First, import the music that you’ll be using and drag it into the audio/music section of the timeline at the bottom.	Add any effects you may want and trim any clips that have bits at the start or end of them that you don’t want to keep.

Identify which numbers will need to be drilled in order to roll the number you selected in Step 1. To do this, look at the number on the opposite side of what you want to roll. For example, if you would like to increase the odds of rolling a 4, then you would look at the side of the dice that is opposite of the 4. This would be a 3. In this example, the 3 is the side that you will want to drill. 2. Secure the dice in a vice. Place the side you will be drilling facing up. You will be drilling these dice. You do not want to hold them steady with your hand because of their tiny size. It is much safer to use a vice to hold them in place while you drill. 3. Use a small drill bit. It should be no larger in diameter than the dots on your dice. You will use it to drill holes into the dots. Only drill where the dots are located. Try to drill straight down to prevent drill holes from intersecting or cracking your dice. You do not need to drill a deep hole. Make the hole no more than 25% of the way through the dice. A more shallow drill is preferred. 4. Repeat this process as many times is as necessary to prepare all of the dice that you will be weighting. 5.	.

Remember that worms ARE living creatures, and thus they ingest, digest, secrete and excrete, the four basic living routines, and elemental functions of life in itself. In a nutshell, you can get started with just a hand full of worms, and expand farther as you need to from time to time, or you can go full bore at once, and follow the guidelines of this article, and others for profit. 2. Decide what you want to make your worm bins from, and if they will last, and where you live and the climate also factor in on what you should build the bins you plan on using. Just about anything can make a good worm bin. Wood, and organic pots of clay that have tiny holes in the bottom, and sides, will rot, but the do work great as a worm bin. Earthen pots of clay also absorb water, so remember to add just a little more water if you plan on using them. Crockery should be avoided, as some crockery may contain lead. Plastic tubs, such as you would find at any construction site, or if you live close to an apartment that is being re-inovated, or if you live in a high rise, or even level ground, the plastic five gallon, or three gallon buckets are great. Remember to drill holes in the bottom for water release, and a few holes here and there, mostly there, in the sides for ventillation. Regardless, make sure that they have no chemicals, insecticides, or paints that could be dangerous. Laquer thinner, solvents, turpentine, gypsum type sheet rock or drywall mud, as it is called, and most cleaning chemicals are caustic, and will kill worms. *It is also not a good idea to use glass, as it can break easily, 3. Next, mix your bedding together, just about anything organic works. If you have access to a paper shredder, you are half there already. Newspapers, non-glossy paper magazines, or even brown paper bags or paper stuffing or packages made from paper, are great bedding when shredded. Glossy paper magazines can contain some inks that are really toxic. If you have to used these mags, shred the pages, and soak them in HOT water for awhile, pour off the water, and repeat with warm water, till the stains of ink are no longer visible in the water. About 4 or 5 times should do well. Be sure to soak them in COLD water for at least 5 or 6 hrs before you use them as bedding. Some glossy papers will actually fall apart when hot water is used. If this happens, use them ONLY in a compost pile. They will be OK there, but will not be good for bin use. If your glossy paper stays together, you can use it in the bins. 4. After you have cleaned, rinsed, and sanitized your 5 gallon tubs, wooden bins or flat plastic tubs, add a mix of wet shredded paper with clay, silt and sand,and some untreated wood sawdust or peat moss or bark chips, and if you want too, add a heaping helping of wet, but cured grass, hay, or rye straw soaked in water. You may want to add some organic potting soil, but DON'T get the kind that has plant food mixed in with the soil! This will surely kill your worms as it contains a lot of acidic products. If you do use grass, make sure it is cured in the sun, if you mix it with the bedding. Green grass clippings on top also aid in giving them a form of organic greens. Later these can be mixed with the bedding if you wish. 5. I use a masons trowel to stir and add all the forms of bedding you want to use. I find this works better than a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, or any such utensel, but don't use them to dig for your worms. Use your hands and a glove. Place several trowel fulls or at least two full cups, of pulverized limestone into the bedding mix for good measure. Mix thoroughly, rotating the tub on its edge, and mixing with a small brick layers trowel, or if you have flat, plastic or wooden bins, mix as good as you can, and then turn the entire mix over into another bin and mix from the bottom once again. Be sure that it is very damp, but not soaking wet. Worms CAN drown. Add more pulverized limestone to the mix if you wish. Be liberal with the pulverized limestone. Wooden bins will also absorb some water because of the porous nature of wood. 6. Next add your worms. This is your choice since there are several types of worms that grow fast, and can really breed often. European Nightcrawlers seems to be a favorite. Canadian Nightcrawlers have to be kept between 39 to 50 degrees Fairenheit. Those touchly little crawlers are quite sensitive to the heat. Red Wigglers are a good fish bait, and breed rapidly. They are best for composting, but can be used in bins. They are sold by the pound, and can be kept easily. Make sure they are Red Wigglers tho, as some dealers will give you the wrong type of worms, and call them Red Wigglers.. If they look to small for a fish hook, then they are not suitable for fishing. * African Nightcrawlers are a great choice, but they breed a little slower than the others. They can withstand moderately high temps, but are very sensitive to cold. These work best if your worm farm is in the basement or enclosed to where it will not fall below freezing. They seem to go dormant, and do not breed at all at temps below 40 F. Regardless of the species you select, the cannot stand sunlight or high temps for long. Keep them in the dark, and relatively cool place. 7. Feed them, feed them often, and watch then grow! You can buy commercially blended foods, or you can make your own out of a mixture of manure, coffee grounds, tea bags, old oatmeal, unseasoned wheat flour, most table scraps except meat, or bone, and corn meal, make sure if it is seasoned (added salt and baking soda) that you wash it thru a coffee filter,or paper towel filter first, before mixing it with other feeds. The water you use will dissolved the baking powder, and salt, and take it out of the way. What remains, you can neutralize with some extra pulverized limestone. I can't say this often enough, be liberal with the limestone as it is calcium carbonate, and helps to sweeten acidic soil, and acids are something that no worm likes, and this adds calcium to the soil in large quantities, which earthworms need to breed. Also when watering, and if it is possible, use rain water. 8. Chlorinated water from the tap needs to sit for a day or so to get rid of the chlorine. Although its not good for your worm beds, in an emergency,if your bin is too dry, you can use a small amount of mildly chlorinated tap water but the smallest sprinkle, the better. * One other choice you have is go to the Feed and Seed Dept, or go to your local Farm Supply, and find out if they have the crumbles of laying mash, cattle or horse feed that has not enriched, and no salt added. Some creme feeds, chop as they call it, are good, but you usually have to buy it in a 50 pound bag! That's a lot IF you are not going to winter feed the worms! You can moisten a handful of these feeds and feed them a mix once a week, adding other ingredients mentioned above, on a time sharing status. Please note also, sprinkle the food on top of the bedding. Do not mix with your bedding, straw, or potting soil. Just remember to FEED THEM OFTEN if you do not compost them. 9.	Heavily watered bins can kill worms. The water should be collected in a tray, and used as liquid fertilizer, but also remember that this is an organic liquid fertilizer, and it is high in nitrogen. Sometimes, tt will attract other insects.

Cut a piece of straw that’s long. Any kind of plastic straw will work. Measure the straw with a ruler and then use scissors to make your cut. 2. Punch a hole through the center of the lid to a glass jar. Use a hole punch to make the hole in the lid. You want to use a clear jar so you can see inside of it when you’re conducting your experiment. * Make sure the hole in the lid is big enough for the straw to fit through. 3. Slide the straw through the hole in the jar lid. Stop when the straw is halfway through the hole. * If the straw falls through because the hole is too big, use glue to hold it in place. 4. Cut of copper wire and twist half of it into a spiral. The spiral will give the wire more surface area so your electroscope works better. Use scissors or wire cutters to cut the copper wire. 5. Drop the straight end of the wire into the straw. When you’re finished, the spiral end of the wire should be sticking out of the straw at the top of the lid, and the straight end should be hanging down from the bottom of the lid. 6. Cut 2 triangle-shaped pieces of aluminum foil and punch a hole in them. Make the pieces of foil the same size, and make sure they’re small enough to fit in the jar without touching the sides. Punch a hole in 1 corner of each foil triangle. 7. Hang the pieces of aluminum foil from the straight end of the wire. First, bend the straight end of the wire so it looks like a hook.	.

Understand that your life, as you knew it, will never be the same, but this does not mean it will not perhaps be better. Maybe you will begin a new career, or a move to a new location and,if this is what you prefer, you might even one day love again. 3. Do not worry that you will forget your spouse. You will not, but with time, the pain of the loss will lessen. Continue living your life with the realization of knowing that your spouse would have wanted you to be happy and productive. 4. Ask yourself what you have always wanted to do that you never had time to because of family obligations. Now is the time to do what you always have wanted to do. Become an artist, or a pilot, or a scuba diver. Be anything you want to be. Most of all, strive to be happy and fulfilled. Your dreams can become a reality and help fill the void in your life.	.

First, gather your supplies: * artificial flowers * ribbon/fabric for the wristband * tape or glue (or some other binding material) * scissors or wire cutters * foliage filler leaves * optional: jewels, pearls, lace, etc. 2. Take your chosen artificial flowers and your scissors/wire cutters. Begin trimming down the stems and tweaking the appearance of the flowers to your liking. 3. Gather your cut down flowers into a bouquet-like shape. Using any binding material (tape might work the best), bunch the flowers together and tape the end of their stems to one another. 4. After the base of primary flowers are binded and assembled, gather the corsage fillers like foliage leaves. 5. Grab your scissors or wire cutters again and cut down your fillers. With the fillers it looks best to have different sizes and shapes to really fill in the space and make the corsage appear full and lively. 6. With the trimmed fillers, bind them to original base of flowers using tape or glue. Keep in mind that since the flowers and foliage are artificial, glue can be used and it won't cause harm like it would to real flowers. 7. Next will be creating the wristband. You can use a ribbon, lace, fabric or any textile of your choice. It would be the most beneficial to use a stretchier material so you can easily put it on and take it off. (Or you could sew in/glue an elastic material on the underside of your chosen wristband). 8. Wrap the wristband around your wrist (or whoever the corsage is for) and trim the material with scissors. You don't want it to be too tight where there can be potential of irritating your skin, but also keep in mind if it's too big it has the opportunity to fall off your wrist. 9. Now, you're going to take the made ""bouquet"" and attatch it to the trimmed down wristband. You can use tape or glue once again for this step. 10. Once assembled, try it on and see if everything fits comfortably and take note of anything you want to add or take away. 11. You can add jewels, pearls, lace, or anything else to add more flair and personailty to your corsage."	.

Hair: This is the part of you that can change what people think of you almost completely! So it must make a GREAT impression. Grooming is really important. You don’t want to be having your hair greasy - EVER! So wash your hair every other day with shampoo and conditioner. As for how you get your hair styled - that’s up to you, but I recommend getting your hair layered from front to back. But don’t go too crazy! - There shouldn’t be more than an inch between each layer. Your hair length should go down to 3-6 inches below the shoulders for the back of your hair. Get LOTS of blond highlights! Wear your hair differently everyday. But be sure that the hair styles are cute! 2. Nails: Nails are very important in your appearance. It may not seem important but it is. People look down at your hands and judge your hygiene by your nails. SO if your nails are bit and unclean people will think differently of you, but not a great deal, but it is still important because it still makes an impression.	Clean under your nails everyday. Paint your nails to match your outfit.

Take care of your hair. Wash your hair every 2 days with shampoo and conditioner. Brush your hair whenever needed or at least 2 times a day. If your hair is heavy, you may enjoy a cut with layers. But don’t go too crazy if you're not used to it - they can take quite a while to grow back out if you don't like it. Be sure that the hair styles are cute. 2. Have nice looking nails. Nails are very important in your appearance. Keep your nails looking good by clipping them once a week to an even length; one popular choice is 3-6 millimeters above the skin. Clean under your nails everyday. Do not paint your nails to match your outfit because it looks puerile. 3. Properly tend to your skin. Just follow these steps to healthy, glowing skin: Wash your face with warm water and facial cleaner or soap every morning when you wake up and at night before you go to sleep. After washing always use facial moisturizer. To keep the rest of your skin clean, take a shower every day using skin soap that won’t harm your skin. Lotion your body immediately after you get out of the shower. Don't use lotion on your face unless it is safe! Drinking lots of water, (at least 8 glasses of water a day), will make your skin glow and keep it healthy. (It also helps with acne). You may also want to carry hand moisturizer or lotion around with you for after you wash your hands or if your skin begins to look ashy. By the way, don’t put lotion on in public – find a bathroom and put it on there! 4. Practice good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth after every meal for 3 minutes, then floss, and use mouth wash to keep your breath smelling good. When you brush, make sure your getting your gums too. Brush your tongue about 1 minute every time your brush your teeth to keep it pink. If you have crooked teeth, get braces and do as your dentist recommends. Do this and you will have a perfect mouth. 5. Keep your lips smooth and looking healthy. Put loads of Chapstick/lip balm on when you’re at home, especially during the winter. Make sure it’s only around your family. In public you should have a thin coat of lip gloss on. It works wonders for your appearance! Vaseline is also a great moisurizer! 6. Stay fit. Health is an essential part of looking good. Ask your doctor before starting any intense exercise routine, especially if you have asthma. Don't kill yourself to reach the numbers below. Use the times as a guide, and do what you can, gradually working your way up to longer distances and faster repetitions. * Warmup (5 minutes): simple stretches for 3 minutes, light jog for 2 minutes * Cardio (15 minutes): jog a mile everyday or jog for 15 minutes a day, * Toning (30 minutes): do 50 sit ups a day, do 20 push ups a day (if you can't do it all in a row, try at least 6 in a row at first) do 60 arm curls a day with 5 pound weights (at least 20 in a row)(hold one weight in each hand, hold arms to sides, then lift weights up to shoulders, then back down and repeat), 50 over head presses (hold 5 pound weights above shoulders with arms bent, then lift arms straight up over head and lower arms back to first position. Do 100 squats and 100 lunges. * Flexibility (10 minutes): hold splits on each leg for 2 min everyday, then straddle (middle) splits for 2 minutes (don’t force yourself to go all the way down at once, and don't bounce in any stretch), stand up with your feet shoulder width apart and reach for your toes for 1 minute, do simple stretches for the next 3 minutes. 7. Eat right. Try not to eat too many calories for your height, but enough to maintain a healthy weight. This number should be increased if you exercise regularly. Eating correctly will help your body keep or become a natural, beautiful shape. Always and only eat healthy meals which are breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack in between lunch and dinner. Don’t overeat – only eat until you are comfortably full. But don't skip meals, either. Minimize sweets and soda, but plan occasional treats. Drink diet sodas if you must have your fizzy drinks.	Don’t become too skinny, it will make you look ugly. And don’t be anorexic, either.

Wash your face with warm water and facial cleaner or soap every morning when you wake up and at night before you go to sleep. After washing always use facial moisturizer. To keep the rest of your skin clean, take a shower every day using soap that won’t harm your skin. Lotion your body immediately after you get out of the shower. Drinking lots of water, (at least 8 glasses of water a day), will make your skin glow and keep it healthy. (It also helps with acne). 4. Practice good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth after every meal for 3 minutes, then floss, and use mouth wash to keep your breath smelling good. When you brush, make sure your getting your gums too. Brush your tongue about 1 minute every time your brush your teeth to keep it pink. If you have crooked teeth, get braces and do as your dentist recommends. Do this and you will have a perfect mouth. 5. Keep your lips smooth and looking healthy. Put loads of Chapstick/lip balm on when you’re at home, especially during the winter. Wearing chapstick in public is nice too, it gives a natural glow to your lips. 6. Stay fit. Ask your doctor before starting any intense exercise routine, especially if you have asthma. Don't kill yourself to reach the numbers below. Use the times as a guide, and do what you can, gradually working your way up to longer distances and faster repetitions.you need at least 90 minutes everyday even if you did 15 min cardio then got up and played wii for another 15 min. try to work our way up to these times and you will have your 90 minutes of exercize * Warmup (5 minutes): simple stretches for 3 minutes, light jog for 2 minutes * Cardio (15-30 minutes): jog a mile everyday or jog for 15-30 minutes a day, * Toning (30 minutes): do 50 sit ups a day, do 20 push ups a day (if you can't do it all in a row, try at least 6 in a row at first) do 60 arm curls a day with 5 pound weights (at least 20 in a row)(hold one weight in each hand, hold arms to sides, then lift weights up to shoulders, then back down and repeat), 50 over head presses (hold 5 pound weights above shoulders with arms bent, then lift arms straight up over head and lower arms back to first position. Do 100 squats and 100 lunges. * Flexibility (10 minutes): hold splits on each leg for 2 min everyday, then straddle (middle) splits for 2 minutes (don’t force yourself to go all the way down at once, and don't bounce in any stretch), stand up with your feet shoulder width apart and reach for your toes for 1 minute, do simple stretches for the next 3 minutes. 7. Eat well. Try not to eat too many calories for your height, but enough to maintain a healthy weight. This number should be increased if you exercise regularly. Eating correctly will help your body keep or become a natural, beautiful shape. Always and only eat healthy meals which are breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack in between lunch and dinner. Don’t overeat – only eat until you are comfortably full. . Minimize sweets and soda, but plan occasional treats. If you eat sweets, eat small portions. 8. Wear light makeup. It's no secret that makeup can improve your appearance. Get makeup that matches your skin tone, wear lip gloss, nail polish, eyeliner, and eye shadow. But don’t make it too obvious, the point is to make people think that you’re not wearing makeup. Don't let your makeup match what you are wearing. This is tacky. Wear all this during the day with touchups every now and then, but make sure you take it off once you get home to let your skin breathe. 9. Speaking of breathing, you want people breathing in good air when they’re around you.	You may need to put it on more than once. The smell shouldn’t be too strong, either. Find a perfume that matches your personality, and stick to it. Don't wear so much that it's overbearing, though.

Start by attaching the plastic cups to each other using the stapler until you get a full circle. After fisrt circle, make another one placing new cups on top of the previous ones and staple them.The important point during stapling is that you will decide the size of your snowman according to the size of circles. * If you are going to make a big one, the circles should be large ones or vise versa. 2. A snowman is made from two round parts (head and body) so you need to staple cups in circles until you have two spheres (one bigger than the other). To have that, you will need to staple the plastic cups until you get the semi sphere then complete the other part of it to have a full sphere body. Repeat the steps until your sphere is getting smaller.	Then repeat this steps for the snowman´s head.

Choose a den that would make a good camp. This depends on the territory your Clan will live in as well as the Animal Jam land that will represent this territory. It may also depend on other things such as the attitude and personality of your Clans' warriors. * For example, if your Clan is battle-hungry and proud, they may live in a dark secluded camp, so choose an Animal Jam den that matches that description for your Clan's camp. However, if your Clan is peaceful, you can choose a den that is light, filled with greenery, and wide open, but still would be well hidden from enemies, like Cosmo's Den. 2. Choose a den that matches your territory. For example, if your Clan lives in cliffs, choose a den that looks rocky, such as the Volcano Den. If you don't like any of the dens as your camp, you can just use a Small House den and decorate it with certain items to make it look like a camp that matches your territory. You can choose any den you want for the camp, but here are some ideas for dens depending on your Clan's territory and the Animal Jam land that will act as your Clan's territory: * Coral Canyons - Volcano Den, Greely's Hideout * Mt. Shiveer - Winter Palace, Crystal Palace, Snow Fort * Temple of Zios - you can use the Small House den and decorate it to look like the Temple of Zios, or you can use Cosmo's Treehouse, the Treehouse Den, or the Epic Haunted Manor. * Crystal Sands - Water Park, Beach House * Sarepia Forest - Cosmo's Treehouse, Treehouse Den, Sky Kingdom, Cosmo's Den, Epic Haunted Manor, Enchanted Hollow, Sky Kingdom * Appondale - Enchanted Hollow, Cosmo's Treehouse, or the Small House Den and decorate it to look like Appondale * Kimbara Outback - Volcano Den, Beach House, or the Small House Den and decorate it to look like Kimbara Outback * Balloosh - Liza's Garden, Cosmo's Treehouse, Treehouse Den, Cosmo's Den, Sky Kingdom 3. Make sure the den looks natural. Most dens in Animal Jam have man-made features. However, you can always use decorations to make the den look more natural. * For example, the Epic Haunted Mansion doesn't look very natural except for the outside, but you can cover up the edges of the den with dark plants, trees, etc. In this den, there are pictures on the walls - you can cover those up with hanging plants or cover up the whole wall to make it look natural. Then add items to use as bedding on the floor of each room and add any finishing touches to the den. * Some dens do look natural, such as the Enchanted Hollow. The only unnatural things are the walls and floors, but you can easily make them look better with certain items or changing how the wall/floor looks. You can also leave the walls and floors as is since they don't look as unnatural as in other dens. 4. Decide if you want a large den or a small den. This can also reflect the way your Clan is. If your Clan prefers to live in a secluded area, protected from enemies, choose a den such as the Small House, or the Enchanted Hollow. If you want a larger den, the Sky Kingdom or Peck's Den would be good examples, and you can use all the small rooms in them as dens as well as adding decorations to make the den look natural. 5. Decide what kind of items you want to use to decorate your den, depending on the den and the territory. For example, if your Clan lives in Coral Canyons and the camp you chose for your Clan is either Greely's Hideout or the Volcano Den, use rocky items to decorate the den. For example, use stone circles to mark the area where a warrior ceremony is held or to create a pathway, or add cave crystals to the front of the den to mark the entrance. If your Clan lives in somewhere like Balloosh, use plant items and water items such as fountains and ponds, or if your Clan lives somewhere like Kimbara or Appondale, use cactus plants and sandy items. * Nature archways come in different themes - for example, there is a Mt. Shiveer themed archway, a Coral Canyons themed archway, etc. You can use these archways depending on what kind of territory you Clan lives in. * If your Clan lives in a dark area, and your camp is in the Epic Haunted Manor, you can use phantom ferns and phantom stumps (won from the Battle for the Beacon adventure) to decorate your camp. 6. Create the entrance to the camp. At the front of the den, add a few rock or plant decorations in a certain shape to represent the entrance. For example, you could add a few overhanging trees to make it look like an archway, or you can create an archway of stone. If you do not want to do that, add a few plants, rocks, etc. to make it obvious that that is the camp entrance and then add a pathway out of decorations such as stone circles, etc. However, it should only be obvious to your Clan that it's the entrance, and it should be secluded so that enemies wouldn't be able to get through and attack your Clan (when roleplaying). * Instead of stone circles, you can also use mossy stone pathways, though they look more man-made than stone circles. 7. Create the area the leader holds meetings from.	It can also be a tree stump, a ledge, or even a random jumble of rocks - use any decorations you want. E.g. you can use the tree stump chair or tree stump table to act as a tree stump. Wolf thrones are also commonly used to act as a highrock, but you can use any item you want to represent it.

Keep yourself clean. When you take a shower always use a body wash or soap such as Dove which cleans efficiently and effectively and does not overdry skin or cause irritation. When it comes to your hair, find a shampoo and conditioner which suits your hair and again does not overdry. * The proper way to wash hair is by first lathering the shampoo into your scalp and then running your fingers along the length of your hair. Then, rub the conditioner on your hair but not into your scalp because your scalp already has natural oils to moisturize it. If you have shoulder-length hair, no more than a quarter sized dollop of shampoo and another equal amount of conditioner would be sufficient. * If you are not allowed to shave or wax, you can always use depilatory creams. 2. Take care of your dental hygiene. Doctors recommend brushing teeth in a circular motion for about five minutes in all, brushing your tongue or using a tongue scraper, preferably brushing the roof of your mouth and gums lightly, and then using mouthwash. If you eat something like onion or garlic in the middle of the day and have no time to stop home and brush your teeth, chew on a piece of minty fresh gum. Use chapstick, lip gloss, or even petroleum jelly. Get braces or Invisalign if your teeth aren't straight. 3. After taking a shower, smooth lotion onto your body. Since cocoa butter is proven to even skin tone and get rid of scars and marks over time, I use a cocoa butter lotion or formula. However, when you go out, very lightly put some on your skin so there is not too much shine. When it is summer, do not put too much. Like oil, lotion can cause blemishes and acne when mixed with sweat. * Use an exfoliating face wash once or twice a day because it makes skin smooth, clean, look younger, and glow. Do not overdo it or else skin may irritate. Try not to touch your face or hair too much or else you will put the oils from you hands onto your face and hair, causing pimples and greasy hair. Well, if you do get pimples, do not pop or touch them! This will leave an annoying scar which would last much longer than the pimple would have if you didn't touch it. If you are one of those who prefer fair skin, leave lemon juice on skin overnight. If you like tan skin, go out in the sun for a few hours but retreat back into your home if your skin is burning or really dry. 4. Take good care of your hair. Shampoo and Condition twice a week, preferably on Sunday and Thursday. If you take showers at night, towel dry your hair as much as you can, comb it with a wide toothed comb and then wrap a cloth around your hair to prevent it from picking up oils from your face and hands. In the morning, unwrap hair and recomb it or brush it and head off to work or school. If you take showers in the morning, either towel dry or blow dry hair. However, do not dry hair completely or else it will seem dull, lifeless, and extremely breakable.	If you want highlights in your hair but do not want to use harsh chemicals, you can always put lemon juice in your hair and then go out into the sunlight. It works just as well.

Style your hair. Don't do your hair in the same style every day. Wash your hair with a good shampoo and conditioner at least two times a week, and experiment with styles. There are loads of choices! If you're feeling dull, get a haircut, or get your hair layered. 2. Accessorize. Wear jewelry. Pick out some cute earrings, maybe a cool necklace and bracelet or two. If your school doesn't allow jewelry, try getting some cute studs, and maybe one of those plaited bracelets made of wool in different colors. They're easy to make, and look great. Try getting an attractive wristwatch. They're handy and look fantastic. And of course, don't forget the accessories in your hair. Use cute hair clips, colorful scrunchies, and cool headbands. Accessories have a big impact on how you look. 3. Change your shoes. Shoes also have a huge impact on how you look. Pick out some cute shoes in lots of cool patterns and colors! Even if your school only allows black leather shoes, don't give up. Buy some really cool black leather shoes--the ones with heels! They can look totally awesome. Take care of your leather shoes, and be sure to polish scratches and marks with proper shoe polish. 4. Wear makeup. Bad day? Just not feeling your absolute best? Don't worry, makeup will help. Be sure not to ever go over the top with makeup. Just use your favorite eyeshadow, a bit of blush, maybe some eyeliner and a bit of lip gloss. Carry a mirror with you for touch-ups. If your school doesn't allow makeup, try using some blush and a bit of cute, tinted lip gloss. If you're willing, try a bit of eyeliner, but don't overdo it. 5. Choose stylish school supplies. It helps if not only you look your best, but if your things look their best! Try wrapping your books in some cool contact paper. Customize your locker with pictures, quotes, and a good background. Buy a cute pencil case. Label your stuff in pretty typing.	Decorate your bag. Put stickers on the zips, label your name in your best markers, and put a couple of cool key rings there. Maybe you can even get your friends to write personal messages on it.

To live productively in prison you have to embrace what you cannot accept. Prisoners might not be able to control their job, bunk assignment, or days they can visit with the family. They can, however, control their attitude. 2. The right attitude will help ensure the prisoner’s days are spent working on tasks that relate to the obstacles they will face upon release. In my case, for example, my conviction cost me my licenses to sell securities. I knew I would have to develop a new skill set. Rather than complain about confinement, or spend all day in the TV room, I worked to develop my writing and speaking skills. I studied esoteric BOP policy. 3. Living productively means finding a win-win. Others in prison might not have had the same opportunities as you. Therefore, you might be in a position to influence others who can benefit from your lives experiences. Teaching others, and helping meant obtain their GED, provided a great deal of meaning to my life and prison term. Create that win-win. 4. It was Aristotle, I think, who said there is gold in moderation. Too many prisoners, from my experience, spend time on tasks that won’t relate to the life they want to lead after prison. For example, it is a wonderful thing to exercise in prison. I mean, really, who is against exercise?	Spending 12 hours walking the track is akin in many ways to watching TV all day. They simply pass the time. Unless you will be a professional athlete upon release, I would keep the exercise in check. Generally, I was against watching TV, but again if you do watch, keep it measured. An hour here or there is fine. If you find yourself, however, beholden to a TV schedule or watch the clock until the Kardashains come on, you are off track. Moderation will allow ample time for studying, exercising and relaxation time.

This is the most suitable way to become aware of the range of services provided to assist your chief executives, the good distribution of the furniture throughout a defined area, the excellent condition of items for the performance, and the light emission to see easily. Some suggestions to keep in mind: * Tailor your informative talks to temporary areas. * Combine all useful resources given that they improve the method of delivering your speech. * Have a word with those individuals appointed to manage the good organization of the space in case you require additional elements. * Make sure chief executives get easy access to their own water or coffee (a water dispenser or a small pot for making coffee in). 2. Make use of electronic devices for a particular task. A computer and projector make more productive your work.	The speaker can also share valuable information with other people in real-time (video teleconferencing). A projector device projects your digital outline on a film surface.

Lose_Two_Pounds_a_Week.txt	Begin_Revision	0.946	### Eat the Correct Amount	1396	Therefore in order to lose a pound of fat you must consume 3,500 less calories than you burn .	### Eating the Correct Amount	1443	In order to lose a pound of fat you must consume 3,500 less calories than you burn .	<delete><Therefore><1>|||<replace><in><2><In><1>	True	"Eat the Correct Amount  1. Calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Your basal metabolic rate or BMR is how many calories you body burns per day performing basic metabolic functions, such as breathing, digesting food, etc. This calculation is important for determining your basic caloric needs. * If you are a women, calculate your BMR using the following formula : 655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) – (4.7 x age in years) * Example: A 5'7"", 135 pound, 30-year-old woman's BMR would be 655 + (4.3 x 135 pounds) + (4.7 x 67) – (4.7 x 30) = 1408.5. * If you are a man, calculate your BMR using the following formula : 66 + (6.3 x weight in pounds) + (12.9 x height in inches) – (6.8 x age in years) * Example: A 6', 180 pound, 30-year-old man's BMR would be 66 + (6.3 x 180 pounds) + (12.9 x 72) – (6.8 x 30 years) = 1924.8. 2. Account for how active you are . If you are sedentary, multiply your BMR by 1.2. If you are moderately active, multiply your BMR by 1.3-1.4. If you are very active multiply your BMR by 1.4-1.5. This resulting number is an estimate of the number of calories you burn per day. * Example: If you, like the above man, had a BMR of 1924.8 and lived an active lifestyle then you would need to multiply your BMR by 1.4. If you did this, you would find that you burn approximately 2694.72 calories per day. 3. Calculate your calorie goal. There are approximately 3,500 calories per pound of fat ."	To lose 2 pounds of fat in a week you must consume 7,000 less calories than you burn in that week. In other words you must have a daily deficit of 1,000 calories to lose 2 pounds of fat in a week.

Gather your materials. You will need: * One paper cup * Tape--masking/painting tape works best * A regular plastic bag, such as one you would get at checkout in a store to carry your items * Scissors--be careful! 2. Cut the paper cup along the seam, where the paper overlaps. When you reach the bottom of the cup, carefully cut around the base, keeping as much of the material as you can. The base can be discarded. 3. Fold the ""unrolled"" cup in half carefully. Cut along the fold so you have two halves. You only need one of the halves to make the kazoo, so you can make two kazoos out of one cup! 4. Cut each side on a slant. Make the top is about two inches wider than the bottom. This will make it taper like a kazoo when you roll it up. You can leave the rim of the cup as it is; it makes a great mouthpiece. 5. Roll the half-cup up into a sort of carrot shape. Leave an opening in each end. The end at the top of the cup (the mouthpiece) should be about one to one and a half inches in diameter, and the opening at the other end should be about one fourth inch. Then tape it along the overlap so it stays rolled like that. 6. Shape the tube so that the mouthpiece is more of an oval than a circle. If you know what a kazoo is supposed to look like, make it look as close as you can to that."	.

Consider why you are learning Japanese and select the method and financial investment that best reflects the results or purpose you wish to achieve. Everyone learns at their own pace, so accept the following as general recommendations and tailor to your individual needs. 2. If you are learning for fun because you like Japanese culture such as manga (comics) and anime (animation) or for travel, get an audio learning CD. Just spending an hour a day can build up grammar usage and teach you simple stock phrases and useful vocabulary. Listen to it during your commute to work in your car or have it ready on your portable music player for lunch and breaks or walks in the park.	You'll also have more fun on a short trip to Japan knowing a few useful phrases than wasting your preparation time cramming obscure Chinese characters into your brain. Your trip should be fun, so spend your prep-time picking places to visit, referencing maps, reading about culture or history and setting your itinerary.
Learn_Japanese.txt	Begin_Revision	0.964	## Warnings	4024	So you should begin studying Kanji very early on if you intend to use Japanese in business or to read and write in Japanese for any purpose .	## Warnings	4090	You should begin studying Kanji very early on if you intend to use Japanese in business or to read and write in Japanese for any purpose .	<delete><So><1>|||<replace><you><2><You><1>	True	"Warnings  * It takes a long time to learn the Japanese language. In the same time it takes to become functionally fluent in Japanese a typical native English speaker could already have learned Spanish and French and German. The rate students drop off from continuing to study Japanese in college is similar to Calculus. So have fun and don't be hard on yourself. Prepare to spend four to six years of moderate to intense study to be comfortable speaking and reading Japanese. * Learn to speak both formal (teineigo) and informal Japanese styles. Depending on the situation you can alter from one to the other, but it requires a good deal of experience to know when it's ok to be informal. When in doubt, err on the side of formal. Formal does not mean you are being submissive. It means you are capable of being nice. You will be shown respect and consideration in return for your efforts to really understand how to speak Japanese well. * Avoid learning dialects (hogen/ben) if you live in Japan. It really should go without saying, but standard Japanese language, referred to as hyojungo, is what you should focus on for at least the first several years. Granted, sometimes it's impossible for you to know therefore you have no choice, but students of the English language do not begin with a regional dialect. If you end up living in Japan and learn some of the local dialect, your neighborhood friends will find it amusing and appreciate your effort to learn what is theirs. But your business associates in Tokyo or Hokkaido will think you're becoming a strange foreigner (henna gaijin). And that's not good. Keep yourself employable. * Do not learn to talk like the opposite gender. There are male and female versions of words and articles. Make sure you're using the correct forms for whichever gender you are representing. Again, this is to avoid becoming a henna gaijin. * Any language is easy to forget, if not practiced, so keep practicing. If you study for several months and then stop studying for a year, you WILL forget all of the Kanji you learned and most of the grammer. Japanese is a hard language to absorb all at once. Even Japanese will tell you that when they live abroad for a long time they begin to forget Kanji. A little bit over a long period of time will prove more effective than cramming once every few months. * Beware of gadgets. You should not buy an electronic dictionary too early. They are expensive, and most of the functions are useless if your Japanese reading skills aren't at a reasonable level to begin with. Ideally you should be able to recognise at least 300-500 kanji prior to making such a purchase. For example looking up Kanji you don't know how to pronounce without understanding its stroke order and number can be impossible. Buy one too early, and you'll be running around with a 70% useless device whose dictionary will be obsolete thanks to better devices on the market by the time you actually can use it. At some point in the future, universities may all begin recommending the same electronic dictionary. Until then, there's no substitute for a good dictionary. And your dictionary won't break if you sit on it, drop it in a puddle or leave it in a car for a week. * Usage and expressions used in animation and comic books are often inappropriate for common situations. Try to learn how real people use the language, not just pop-culture characters. * Japanese are often described by Americans as being passive aggressive. For example, you could be telling your new Japanese friend about a trip to Disney World you'd like to invite them on and they may say ""yes, yes, yes"" while they're listening to your description of the details. But then at the end you may be shocked to find out they really don't want to go. You might not even find out directly from the person you asked but from one of their friends, which can be infuriating. Don't be afraid to ask clearly ""Do you want to go this weekend with us?"" It will help cut through the cultural clutter in the beginning, but you should practice tuning in and getting to know by a person's words and body language over time how they are reacting to you. Not just their speech. Also, always give them the option to decline. Japanese respect free will just as much as other cultures. * Japanese is actually relatively easy to learn to speak, but so unlike English that many English speakers find it difficult in the beginning. Writing Japanese requires learning 2000+ Kanji (Chinese characters) in addition to two phonetic alphabets (Hiragana and Katakana) that have roughly 40 characters each. The alphabets are easy to learn and can be mastered in a few weeks. Writing and deciphering Kanji takes years to develop a full understanding of and ultimately master. The average reading level required to read a common newspaper is higher than that in the west which is why literacy rates are much higher in Japan than say, in the USA."	.

If the person next to you is bowing or replies to a set greeting in a particular way, follow their example the next chance you get. The best people to observe are those of your own age group and gender. What is appropriate for an older man is likely not correct for a younger woman. * Any language is easy to forget if not practiced, so keep practicing. If you study for several months and then stop studying for a year, you WILL forget all of the Kanji you learned and most of the grammar. Japanese is a hard language to absorb all at once. Even Japanese people will tell you that when they live abroad for a long time they begin to forget Kanji.

They are expensive, and most of the functions are useless if your Japanese reading skills aren't at a reasonable level to begin with. Ideally you should be able to recognize at least 300-500 kanji prior to making such a purchase. * If you go to Japan and attempt to speak Japanese outside of a formal or business setting you may, on occasion, be brushed off. Some people simply don't want to bother with what they assume you will speak judging by your appearance- slow, incorrect, awkward Japanese. Don't let this put you off learning the language. The number of people who will kindly and patiently listen to whatever you are trying to say far outnumbers those who don't want to deal with you at all. * Learn writing and kanji last, not with hiragana, katakana, or any other words. This way when you do get to kanji, you can apply the Japanese meaning only and not have to worry about translating it back and forth to fully understand it. * When speaking Japanese, try not to say words too fast or too slow.	.

They can be very trying, but so can proximal relationships. If you are a very needy or jealous person, recognize that these tendencies may not be compatible with any type of healthy relationship, but may make a long distance relationship nearly impossible to sustain.	If your relationship began on the internet or over the phone, friends, family and colleagues may not understand your preoccupation with someone you have never met. Listen to their advice with a grain of salt. But they may have been there themselves or know someone else who has been there. The internet is young and no one really knows as yet how many lasting relationships are forged this way so do not let the naysayers get you down. Remember if the goal is a permanent partnership the goal is to eventually meet at some point so do not neglect or put it off for too long.

Tell your parents that you are trying to improve your health. If they know this, they will side by you. If you tell them you're trying to lose pounds, they will worry that you will become too skinny or anorexic (see warnings) and will tell you not to. 2. Don't starve yourself; just eat healthily. Always eat three meals a day and a couple of snacks in between.. If you skip breakfast, it makes you put on weight because then your body then goes into starvation mode and actually stores fat! Try to cut out most of the sugary, high-fat, and high-sodium foods. 3. Go through your pantry and get rid of unhealthy foods. Things that tempt you, like sugary cereals, will no longer tempt you if they're in the trash. Or, if you have family members that want the cereal, give it to them to hide. And don't go looking for it. 4. Help your parents stock up on healthy foods on your next trip to the grocery store. Pick things like fruits, vegetables, chicken, turkey, fish, whole wheat bread, and low-fat dairy, like yogurt and milk. 5. Set up a healthy exercise routine. You will want to set a certain amount, like 30 minutes a day, 6 days a week.	Pop into your roller blades, jump rope, do an exercise video (Firm and Self are good ones), bike to the park, walk the dog, walk to school, or wake up early and take a jog. You could also take up sport lessons or a team sport. But remember, it's important to stick to your plan. Don't skip days or go for less time than you promised.

Remove the bar from a cartilage hoop earring. It is possible to keep the bar on, but this will be very uncomfortable when it comes time to put the ring on your lip. So, use a pair of wire cutters to remove the bar. Make sure that you snap off the bar all the way. 2. File down the rough metal. The newly exposed metal will be rough and uncomfortable. Use a file or sandpaper to make the metal smooth. Run your finger over the metal when you’re done to make sure it is completely smooth. 3. Wash the earring thoroughly. It is not sanitary to immediately put the fake lip ring in your mouth, so wash it when you’re done filing the metal. Use water and soap on it. You can use your fingers to rub the soap onto the loop or you can apply it with a towel. 4. Tighten the ring to your lip. Put the lip on the whichever side of your mouth you’d like it to be on. Typically, the lip ring should be worn on the bottom lip.	It should feel comfortable, but it needs to stay in as you move around.

Keep your lips well moisturized and save them from tanning.This is the most essential part. Dry lips often get cracked appearance and in worse conditions, they even start bleeding. Sometimes the injuries even leave marks on your lips that add to darkening. Tanning is another reason why lips get darker. The best way to fight dry and damaged lips is to use a good quality lip balm. Make sure your lip balm has sun blocking material like SPF 30 or above, this will help you fight sun tanning. 2. Use good quality lipstick and other lip cosmetics.Do you simply pick up a lipstick, lip-liner, or a lip gloss because it has an attractive shade or it is just the one which will suit your favorite party dress? Next time when you go shopping, make sure to check the composition of your lip cosmetics other than checking the shade, shine and color. Lip cosmetics with vitamins and lip conditioners are best to choose. Also try looking for a product that has more natural ingredients than chemicals. Make sure that the product includes sun blocking material if you go in the sun a lot. Avoid using darker shades all the time. If you prefer wearing lipstick everyday, don't select a darker shade as over-using them also leave the lips darker. It will be better to choose lighter shades or a natural shade for everyday use. 3. Try a lip lightening massage.Massages prove great way to lighten the dark color of your lips. One simple massage involves rubbing your lips with an ice cube for a minute or two and then patting them dry with a towel and applying moisturizing cream on them. It works really great because ice massage improves the flow of blood to your lips giving them redder and lighter appearance. This also removes the dirt and lightens up the complexion. 4. Use lemon juice for lightening your lips.You must have heard how lemon juice works really well in giving a lighter complexion to your skin. In the similar way, it works on your lips and gives them great complexion. Moreover, lemon is a best source of Vitamin C which is best for all kinds of skin issues. So, simply rub a few drops of lemon juice on your lips everyday and it will help you lighten your lip-color. For best results, use it before going to bed and wash them in the morning. 5. Use potatoes for fighting lip darkening.Potatoes contain ‘catecholase,’ a naturally occurring enzyme which is best known for reducing skin darkness. Simply cut a slice of potato and rub it on your lips. Using this regularly will soon make your lips naturally pink. 6. Use pomegranate lip scrub. This scrub works really well in lightening your lip color. Simply take a few drops of pomegranate juice and mix it with few drops of milk and crushed rose petals. Use this scrub on your lips and rub for a while. This will enhance your lip complexion. 7.	I know this sounds weird but try it. it has done wonders for me. Just mix half a teaspoon with half a teaspoon of brown sugar, and scrub your lips.

Accept change. Part of letting go is accepting change. If you’re intent of things having one particular outcome, letting go can be more difficult. Accepting change means moving out of living in the past and accepting your new present and future. Change is almost always uncomfortable at first, especially if you’re not the one making the changes. Once you move past the discomfort, consider moving into a place of accepting your circumstances. * For example, if you wanted to buy a house but your offer was not accepted, acknowledge that you will not get the house. While you may feel disappointed, gather your efforts into looking at other houses that may also be a good fit. 2. Find the positives in change. Think about the silver lining that may accompany letting go of what you cannot change. While you may feel devastated by the outcome of certain events, look for whatever positives can come from it. While it can be difficult to experience the pain of change and letting go, there can also be positive experiences that come from them. *	You may become clearer in the goals you want to pursue or what direction you want to take for your life. You may even recognize who your real and true friends are.

Ask permission from your parents to make a snack. There are lots of reasons why your mom or dad might not want you to have a snack, even if it’s healthy. For instance, they might want you to eat dinner soon, and worry that you’ll get fill on your snack. You might also have a food allergy and need careful supervision to ensure that you avoid certain snacks. * To ask your parents’ permission to make a healthy snack, simply ask, “Can I make a healthy snack?” * If your parents say no at first, ask, “Can I make a healthy snack later?” 2. Ask an adult to help you out. Even the best chefs need help. Always ask an adult – your mom, dad, another family member, or a friend’s parents – to help you out when preparing snacks in the kitchen. This will make the snack-making process easier. Plus, it will give you and your parents (or your adult caretaker) a chance to bond. * Having and adult help you is especially important if you’re using knives, the stovetop, or other appliances. * To ask an adult to help you out, just ask your parent or guardian, “Will you help me make a healthy snack?” * As you become more skilled at making healthy snacks for yourself, your adult might begin to let you take on a more responsibility in the kitchen, including allowing you to make some healthy snacks unsupervised. 3. Dress for success. When you make a snack, you might get messy. Before making your healthy snack, you should don an apron. If you don’t have an apron – or don’t have an apron that fits you – you could wear an old t-shirt that you don’t mind getting messy. * Don’t wear baggy clothes when making a healthy snack. Baggy sleeves might cause you to accidentally make a bigger mess than you otherwise would. 4. Wash your hands. Kitchen safety means that you only eat clean food. If your hands are yucky, your food will not be clean.	Scrub the fronts and backs of your hands all the way up to your wrists. Don’t forget to clean between your fingers, too.

Find music that captivates you, which you would like to listen to attentively. You are going to try to develop a mental map of the music. 2. In music, there are three main technical ideas: repetition, variation, and new. Listen, trying to notice whether what you are hearing is the same as something you previously heard in the same piece(repetition); related but different (variation); or seeming unrelated to everything you previously heard (new). The beginning of a piece is always new. There is very often something new very near to the end. 3. Find passages in the music that you find especially rewarding. Are these passages repetitions, variations, or new? 4. If they are variations, can you home in on what it was that was varied? 5. Listen again. This time, pay attention to whatever it is that brings the music to these passages. Don't listen with bated breath -- listen to as many details as you can. 6. Listen to details such as the colors, balances and textures of the different sounds of which the music is composed. 7. Try to isolate specific details: rhythms, whether in the foreground or background, that seem to interact; short melodic figures, either in the principal melody (if there is one) or in the accompaniment. 8. Listen again, narrowing your focus: listen only to the bass, if there is one, paying no attention to anything else. Notice things in the bass that seem alive, pregant with meaning. 9. Listen again, this time scanning the music with your listening mind; try to notice all of the details you previously noticed by switching your attention from one to the other. 10. Now, try to notice the kinds of changes that happen at your favorite moment.	Does a new rhythm add pungency? Does a buzz suddenly splinter into a fractured collision?

Tell yourself all the reasons you should leave. If you stay you're just hurting yourself, his children, his family, his wife. And it's been shown that most men who cheat a first time will cheat again. Which means he'll eventually cheat on you. 2. Make a final decision to leave. Perhaps you've left before, only to be promised that he'll leave his wife soon, and told how much you were loved. Maybe he wooed you back. But it's been a while and he's still with her. And you have finally had enough. Make a decision to leave him for good. 3. Tell him you want to meet him in a place you know is risky for him. If he agrees to meet in a risky place try to show him affection and watch him pull away. As difficult as it is, the fact that he won't be affectionate with you in public, or want to go somewhere he might be seen will only make your resolve to leave stronger. 4. Tell him outright you've had enough. That you want out and that perhaps you love him but it's not enough anymore. You've heard his promises for a very long time and he has never made good on them and you're done. Even if he pleads and begs be firm and strong. You are leaving him, regardless of his reaction. 5. Change your phone number, and do not program his in. One of the best ways to break up with a married man is totally and completely. No late night calls, no calls during the day when he's at work away from his wife and kids. If he does not have your number and you don't program his in your phone you'll be less likely to call him. And he wont be able to call you. 6. Block him from your email, facebook and linkedin. You don't want any contact or reminders. So block him from everyplace you can think of. He needs to realize that you're done. This is just part of how you're showing him that. 7. Tell him you'll contact his wife if he does not leave you alone. Usually the threat alone is enough for him to go away. And when he does, remind yourself of how easily he left and realize you will find someone much better out there sometime very soon. 8. Go out and do things you love. And while you're out, flirt. Maybe you're not ready for another romance, but don't stay in bed crying, get out there and connect with other people, and other men. Show yourself you are a sexy, attractive woman who will find someone much better very soon. 9. Pamper yourself. Take long bubble baths, wear lingerie just for yourself, because you deserve it. Reinforce the fact that you don't need a man, especially a married man, to show you and make you feel beautiful. 10. If he shows up at work have a co-worker ask him to leave. If he shows up at your house don't answer the door and if he calls hang up on him. Cut him off entirely, If you have nothing to do with him you will move on faster. 11. When you're ready start dating.	Or a few someones. Just don't become involved with a married man again. If you meet someone married remember the heartbreak and move on without letting him get close. You will find someone single who is right for you.

Make them small enough so that anything you but in the bowl will not fall through. * Aluminum can method: Use your scissors to cut a rectangular piece out of an aluminum soda can. Then, coil this rectangle into a funnel shape. You want the top of the funnel to be large enough to put tobacco in, and the bottom to be small enough that nothing can fall through. Next, take your funnel and slide it into the hole in the bottle cap. The bottle cap should more or less bisect the funnel, so that the top of the bowl sticks out but the bottom will go down into the bottle when you but the cap back on. * At this point, you can use hot glue or superglue to glue the funnel to the bottle cap and make sure that the hole is sealed airtight. 4. Your gravity bong is now ready for use. In order to use it, fill the bottle up with water and cover the hole at the bottom with your thumb.	Light the tobacco in the bowl and release your thumb from the hole at the bottom. As the water drains, air will be sucked through and the bottle will fill with smoke. When the water has completely drained, unscrew the cap and inhale.

Get t-shirts. Sports stores or places bulk sellers like Target or Walmart are great for getting good-quality t-shirts in bulk. Cotton is the easiest fabric to work with, but try polyester and blends as well. 2. Put a sheet of cardboard, between the layers of the shirt. This will prevent ink, paint, or dye from bleeding through to the back of the shirt. 3. Buy supplies to decorate your t-shirt. If you want to draw or write on your t-shirt yourself, sharpies are fine (and they come in many colours and tip-sizes now and won't wash off or fade). Craft stores sell fabric paint and fabric markers, and you can also buy t-shirt dyes. You'll also find there studs, rhinestones, decorative patches if you feel like experimenting with different textures.  4. Iron on images using special printer paper. Transfer sheets are sold for both white and black/dark coloured tees, and you can buy specialty paper at your local art store. Many require an iron to adhere your image to the t-shirt.  * Follow the instructions carefully and be careful with hot irons and ink. * *Try on your shirt and mark lightly where you want the image to fall. After that, pin your tee to a ironing board or a sturdy surface so that the image goes exactly where you want it. 5. Let the t-shirt dry overnight.	Leaving a shirt in the sun or carefuly hanging it may speed up the process.

Watch the news. Newscasters will give frequent updates on the weather in your area and will always call attention to dangerous or disastrous conditions. Pay close attention to the local weather in your area. Also, it is helpful to know what the newscasters are talking about. Some common terms you may hear are: * Flood or Flash Flood Watch. This means that a flood could occur in your area, but has not happened in your area or surrounding areas yet. * Flood or Flash Flood Warning. This means that a flood has already occurred around you and may occur in your area very soon. 2. Stock up on food and water. You will want to have supplies ready in case a flood traps you in your house. Make sure you have 3 days-worth of food and clean drinking prepared and ready to go. Make sure that the food supplies you pick will not go bad and do not require any preparation. * Canned foods are good because they do not spoil and are generally ready to eat. 3. Keep the necessary supplies ready. There are a number of items you will want to have prepared in case a flood hits your area. These basic supplies will help you deal with emergency situations and keep you informed in the event of a disaster like a flood. Some things to have ready are: * A first aid kit. This will help you be ready to deal with minor injuries that may occur during a flood, like scrapes, cuts or minor burns. * A flashlight. When floods hit, the power often goes out. You will want to have a flashlight, and replacement batteries, ready in case of a flood. * A battery-powered or hand-crank radio. You need to stay connected to the outside world to listen for information or warnings about the flood. If the power goes out, you will need a radio that does not rely on electrical current. * Medical supplies and documents. Make sure you collect all of your medical records and supplies in the shelter with you. If you or anyone in your family takes prescription pills, uses a hearing aid, glasses, a cane, etc. bring these items to the shelter with you. Also, any documentation of a family member’s medical records can be helpful in case of a medical emergency. * Hygiene products. It is important to have toilet paper, paper towel, antibacterial soap, and towels ready for everyone in the shelter. * Personal documents, family heirlooms and keepsakes. There are some documents (such as the deed to your house, your insurance cards, drivers licenses, etc.) that should be sealed up in plastic bags and brought to the shelter with you.	.

Make a template of any size. A recommended size to start with is 5"" by 5"". 2. Cut 3 squares of the same color of fabric and repeat two more times with each fabric color. The clip on the square should make it easy to cut the fabric. Most completed fidget quilts are usually 17"" by 21"", but you can make yours at any size. 3. Sew the squares together into strips. 4. Sew the strips together using a 1/4 inch seam.This will become your top. 5. Iron your top, making sure all the seams are ironed the same direction and are laying flat. 6. Obtain several different yarns and ribbons. Your tassel can be any length you want. 7. Cut all your ribbons and yarn to the same length. 8. Pull them through a ring and fold it in half. 9. Use a sturdy piece of string or yarn to tie everything together at the top. This should be removable and not washable, so when you're sewing it into the quilt top, you'll sew a small loop of ribbon or a tab to hang the tassel on. This loop is usually made on the top of the quilt, so make sure the border covers it. 10. Cut circles of any size out of fabric. The larger the circle, the bigger the yo-yo. 11. Hand-sew around the outer edge of the fabric. 12. Remove your needle and pull on both ends of the thread. It will gather up into a circle. 13. Knot the thread so it stays gathered. 14. Use glue to add a big bright button to the center of each yo-yo. 15. Add velcro using some glue and sew the other side of the velcro down. 16. Add a fleece teddy bear to your quilt. You can make the bear on an embroidery machine. The finished teddy bear is 7"" by 5"". Consider building using a recycled jean pocket to store the teddy bear. 17. Decide on which fidgets you want to use. You can use any number of fidgets. 18. Pin all your fidgets on the top of the quilt. 19. Sew the fidgets onto the quilt.

Remember it doesn't necessarily mean getting to an orgasm or feeling pleasure, but to get to know your reactions to stimulation better. 5. If you feel comfortable enough, after attempting masturbation a few times, the insertion of one or two lubricated fingers might be fine. You might feel some resistance, discomfort or even mild pain when doing so. If so, relax your muscles (similarly to when you're going to pee) and change the direction of your finger. Generally, after pushing two or three inches inside your vagina you will feel no pain at all. This happens because there's a tight ring of muscles in that location. 6. You might dislike the feeling of penetration at first, specially when you try it with a bigger phallic object. You might feel some discomfort, similar to when you're on your period or removing a tampon but remember, this is perfectly natural. When you try this more often, the odd sensation will disappear and eventually become pleasurable. 7.	When you feel ready to sleep with your partner for the first time, remember to be calm, use a lot of lubricant and start penetrative sex only when really aroused. If you experience pain and/or extreme tightness, just remember the next step...

Only a doctor can examine you, inform you about your own situation and make sure everything is all right for comfortable future intercourse. * It is possible to get pregnant the first time you have intimacy. What we are not typically told is that condoms have the highest pregnancy rate among the most common methods of birth control. But they do. Typical use results in 15 out of 100 users getting pregnant each year.	About three out of every 20 couples using condoms to avoid pregnancy end up pregnant anyway within the first year of use. So if possible, use another form of birth control along with a condom. If you take birth control and are taking some form of medication for a virus , such as a antiboitic, this can alter birth control! So be careful when taking birth control and antibiotics.

You will repeat this for all of your mussels and then wash them under running water. 3. Step Three. Crab LegsThe process for cleaning the crab legs is simple. All you do is wash them under running water to make sure you don’t have any other debris on them like sand 4. Step Four. CrayFIsh...This step is as simple as the last. Take your crayfish and rinse them to make sure that all debris is washed off. After that store your crayfish on ice to preserve freshness. 5. Step Five. Sausages... On your cutting board cut the sausage into 1 inch slices. Repeat for the remaining sausages. 6. Step Six. Corn... First peal the green part off of the corn on the inside.

If you have acne use products to control it. Wearing makeup over spots can sometimes make them more obvious so find a good spot cream and wash your face before you go to bed, add foundation if in a hurry. * Wear blush just below your cheek bones. * For your eyes, use an eyeshadow that accentuates your eye color, then curl your eyelashes. Use one or two coats of mascara and then an eyeliner that fits your eye color best (ex: black works well with brown eyes, while a brown works well with green) Apply eyeliner, depending on how intense you want to look and the color of your skin.

Gather the things you’ll need. Remember that there’s no strict list; you can mix and match what you want. You can gather a variety of differently sized and coloured autumn leaves, or make them all identical. It’s generally best to stick with medium sized to small leaves though, as you want the bunches to be graceful, not oversized and untidy. As for autumn plants, you can take your pick depending on where you live; pine cones, berries or flowers. 2\. Make sure all of your items stick to a colour palette; typically for autumn you’ll be looking for a range of auburns, browns, gold and reds. Make sure that the ribbon you select adds the ultimate touch – a deep red or gold ribbon, or perhaps a striped or checked one, will be perfect. When gathering your items, remember the following:  * Your flowers should be removed from sunlight as soon as they are cut so that they will dry with their colour preserved. * your flowers should also not be fully mature; else they will lose their petals. 3\. Dry your flowers. You can use the microwave technique for drying daises or roses, or tie your flowers in small bunches and hang them upside down in a dark, dry area such as an unused closet. Allow your flowers to dry for two to three weeks. Yes, this takes time and patience, but it ensures that your bunch lasts longer and makes it look all the more attractive. 4\. Dry your autumn leaves. In the meantime, take care of your autumn leaves. There are various methods for drying and preserving autumn leaves, and they don’t take the same amount of time as flowers, so get to work. You can choose to:  * Microwave them. Try microwaving your leaves until they’re completely dry, between double layers of paper towels. Be careful, though, as they could catch on fire. * Use wax paper. Place a leaf between two pieces of wax paper, place a towel on top and press it with an iron to seal the wax paper. Do both sides and then cut around the leaf. Carefully peel the wax paper off. * Soak them in glycerin solution. Mix glycerin and water so that it’s one part glycerin and two parts water. (you only need about one cup).	Soak them for 2-6 days and then dry them gently with a paper towel. This method helps keep the leaves more flexible.

The return rate for this type of grazing is low, where livestock will often only be allowed to return to it at a maximum of only two or three times a year or per grazing season, one to two being most common. * Low-density high-frequency grazing where a large group of animals are only allowed to have one bite per plant and nothing more."	.

Consider the size of the cage. The Humane Society of the United States has noted that most cages available on the market for guinea pigs are simply too small. In fact, most cages are instead meant to house smaller animals like hamsters and gerbils. * Unlike other animals, guineas pigs need floor space, not vertical space. They need ample room to move around and exercise in order to stay healthy. * A cage that is too small for a guinea pig can cause the animal to become bored and depressed. Imagine if you had to spend your entire life living in a closet with little room for activity and stimulation. * Guinea pig cages that are too small have also been linked to the development of certain medical conditions. They are more likely to get pododermatitis (the equivalent of bed sores, but on their hocks) as a result of sitting still on soiled bedding. * Larger cages are also better if you have more than one guinea pig so that each pet can have its own personal space. * Larger cages also have benefits for you as well! They're easier to clean because they enable guinea pigs to separate their ""bathroom"" space from their other living areas. 2. Follow the appropriate size guidelines. Typically, the recommended standard cage size is about 2 square feet per guinea pig. However, this is insufficient, as there is not enough room for everything a guinea pig needs, including food, water dish, nest, and bathroom area."	.

The other team has catchers 10 yards away from the wall and the pitcher is 5 yards away from the wall. The pitcher throws the tennis ball very hard at the bottom of the wall sending the ball back in the way of the batter. The batter must calculate where the ball will end up then go there. Then he tries to smack the ball with the bat so that the ball reaches high up on the wall . Now the ball will bounce off the wall and it will be the catcher's turn to make a play. 5. The catcher has two options. The two options are to catch the ball and get 1 out or drop it and let the player start running. When the player runs, he must be tagged with direct contact from the tennis ball. You cannot throw the ball at the runner unless your playing with a softball or you are using street rules.

This is called a switch. The game ends when there are 6 switches, or one team scores 20 points. 7. These are the basics, but now you need to score and make special defensive plays. To score, the runner must get to the starting base, but to do so he must run all the way around to 1st base, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and back to home. This puts 2 points on the board. Another way to score points is to stop at the 3rd base and only get 1 point. This makes the point process slower, but it is very effective and puts points on the board. 8. To score on defense you must jail an opponent. To jail an opponent, you must tag him on the run before he gets to base 2.	Then, he goes back to the opposing team and the defense scores 2 points and the offense loses 1 point.

Pay attention to your cat. It's hard to love someone when they pay no attention to you. Pet your cat often and show him or her that you care about them. But try not to pay too much attention to your cat because then they will find you annoying. 2. Try to keep your cat out of trouble. You want your cat to know that they are safe and protected. If they know this, they can love you better. 3. On the subject of food, don't change your cat's food drastically or too often. When they do something good try to reward them with a treat. 4. Don't leave your cat alone for long, or very often When you are going out put your cat outside or if it is toilet trained then you can leave your cat inside to a bit of peace and quiet . If you do have to leave, make sure your cat has enough food and to love and pet your cat when you come back. Make sure your cat knows you missed them. 5. Cats are independent no matter what their personality. If he or she is not paying attention to you or decides it's done bathing and accepted being patted, and thinks the birds outside are more interesting at that present time, don't fret as they probably just need a breather. * Just like any person, cats need their personal space too! Remember not to be on top of them all the time. Don't smother them; cats hate that. 6. Brush your cat often. They have a lot of extra fur that can get all over everything. They also loved to be brushed. You could also try brushing their teeth. You can get special brushes and toothpaste from your vet. If you start off with your finger and then start with the brush. Taking care of your cat will determine the amount of love they give you. 7. Don't pick them up a lot or chase them; let them come to you. Invite them onto your lap, but don't drag them. 8. When the cat is all cozy and closes it eyes after looking directly at you, return its affection by petting and make soothing purring sounds. 9. Keep the litter box clean or they will find somewhere else to go. Also, don't drastically change kitty's kind or brand of litter. Mix the two brands, slowly losing the old kind. 10. Get down on the cat's level and let them come to you. Cats don't like to have to look up to see your face, the cat might not think it looks like you and will attack! 11. Talk to your cat. This may sound insane. But after a while they will start understanding you. They love to know you care and when they hear your voice they know you care about them. After a while they will recognize different words. 12. If your cat has done something right the first time you ask, offer a reward. 13. Give your cat some space. It doesn't always want attention, if it's sleeping peacefully, don't disturb it, let it rest. 14. When it's up, slowly walk forward and bend down to pick it up, cats like people when they're at the same level as them. It frightens them when they have to look up to see a scary giant! (not that we are scary, its our height that scares them). 15. Sign to them. When you're sitting down and you want it come to you, start putting your hand caved above your legs, making sure you leave enough space for them to jump on your lap. 16. Offer them a very small amount of milk. Most cats love milk. If the cat drinks too much milk, they can become sick. Most cats, like many people, are lactose intolerant. Milk often causes a cat to have diarrhea. You can now find lactose free milk in stores, specially made for cats.  17. Play with them. Use a string or a toy to interact with them, make sure you interact as well or they won't have as much fun with you. 18. If your cat nudges you it means he/she likes you. 19. If there is more than one person in your house, try and be the person who feeds the cat. The cat will get used to this and come to you straight away if hungry or its time for dinner. 20.	.

Select your keepsake vase or container. You can use virtually any container to pour your sand into, though glass vases are the most common. Some options include a heart-shaped vase, cylinder jar, corked bottle, or decanter. Base your decision off of you and your spouse’s tastes. * Consider a vase that is decorative and attractive, so you can show it off in your home after your wedding. * Another option is opting for a custom-made photo frame. Look this up online to order a personalized frame. 2. Choose your pouring vessel containers. Select 2, easy-to-pour containers, such as glass vase or corked bottle. Get creative with your containers! For example, if you are hosting your wedding on a beach, you can pour out of seashells. * The look of your pouring vases doesn’t matter as much as your main vase, though you can reuse these glasses as flower vases or other decorations. 3. Pick sands in 2 different colors to represent the bride and groom. Selecting different colored sand works best because you can easily see the different layers after the ceremony is complete. Go with neutral colors of sand, or match your sand to your wedding colors. You can buy your sand online or at craft stores, or you can collect your own.Get creative and use sand from different destinations! * Gather sand from your favorite beach or memorable vacation, like the Caribbean or Florida. When traveling, scoop a bit of sand to save for your wedding. * Choose 2 different sands to represent the bride and the groom.	Maybe the groom is from South Carolina, so he uses sand from the Outer Banks. You can choose sand that is from your hometown or representative of your personality or passions.

What do you want? What color? What kind? What colors do you want to use on your backpack? Do you want to use your current backpack, or get a new backpack? What kind of backpack do you want? * Look up splatter backpacks online. This can help you get inspiration for the type of backpack you want to decorate, and what colours you could use. 2. To get started, you need fabric paint, or acrylic paint. If you're using acrylic paint, you need to buy the fabric median, too. Paint brushes are also recommended; a 3/4 inch (usually the largest size brush in a brush package at Walmart) is the best brush size you're going to get. You can buy these at Hobby Lobby, or at Michele's. You're going to need some paper cups, too. * Try getting an inch size brush, and/or a inch and a half brush size too, if you want to have different sized splatters on your backpack. 3. Once you've organized your supplies, you're ready to get started, but there's some things you need to know before you paint your backpack. * Do this outside and set out a couple of feet of newspaper. You can do this inside, but it can make a big mess! * Make sure you change into some old clothing you don't care about. You don't want your new clothes covered in paint! Putting on gloves is also a big help. * If you're using acrylic paint and wonder ""Why do I need the fabric median?"" or ""How much fabric median do I need to add to my paint?"" Then you are just being smart and thinking ahead! The fabric median is used to make the paint flexible on fabric, so that way it doesn't crack or flake off the backpack. You should read the instructions printed on the bottle before you do anything. You should add half the amount of fabric median of the paint you're using. (Example: for every 2 oz. of paint you add 1 oz. of fabric median. For every 6 tbs. of paint you add 3 tbs. of fabric median. Don't really add this much paint!) When measuring the paint, it doesn't have to be a real measurement. It could just be an old spoon. But it will get stained and it won't wash out easily, so make sure it's something that isn't very valuable to you. * Always wash your brushes thoroughly so that way you don't mix the paints. Rubbing the brush on a paper towel after wash is recommended if you are switching between paints. * Your going to need paper cups 4. Now you're ready! First, fill every pocket and zipper with newspaper."	Now it's time to let your imagination flow! Dip your brush and flick at the backpack. The harder you flick, the more splatters you get.

Let's say you're filling water up in a bathtub and your phone rings. You figure ""it's taking forever to fill up, I'll just go talk to so and so for a moment and come right back."" You talk on the phone for 10 minutes, forgetting all about the water you left running in the bathroom.

That's what it is like if you don't cry. You will eventually explode and overflow with emotions. The best thing to do is get it all out. Don't be afraid of crying. If you feel more comfortable doing it in private, ask to be excused for a moment to use the restroom or go to your room. Find a good place for crying. Depending on how emotionally attached you were to this person, you'll probably be going to this special place specifically for crying a lot. 2. Think about all the bad things about the person you loved and the negative consequences of going out with them. You might think this person has no flaws and they're perfect, but that's not true at all. The old saying really is true; nobody's perfect. Even something as little as them chewing with their mouth open will work. Try to make a list of everything you disliked about them and their flaws. Maybe they were rude to your best friend or they have horrible friends. Whatever it is, write it down and when you start feeling those old feelings creeping back, read the list. Also, try to think about any negative feelings there may be for going out with him/her. Would it ruin your family friendship because your parents think that person is wrong for you? Would it affect your grades/schoolwork or friendships? Is that person mentally unstable for you? Does that person bring you down a lot? These are some things to consider. If you begin thinking that he wasn't right for you anyway, you will no longer care if it works out or not. 3. Get your mind off of him/her. Hanging out with friends, joining a club (ex: drama club, creative writing or book club, and online clubs) help a lot. Do anything to get your mind off of him/her. Write song lyrics or stories, do homework, hang out with friends at the mall, watching movies...all of these things work. Make sure that you're not thinking of him or her and there is absolutely no reason for you to encounter them or think about them. For example, if they work at the mall and your friends want to go there, don't go. Stay home and do something else. The whole point is to move on, and for most people who are in love, the moment they see their loved one again or the moment they start to communicate with them old feelings begin coming back. So make sure you won't be seeing them at all. Try to find a hobby you're interested in such as art, music, writing, books, dance, etc. You can also kill two birds with one stone by trying to get something good done while moving on, such as losing weight, studying or doing homework, practicing for a speech or playact, or earning money. 4. Get away from everything that reminds you of them until you're over them. This means not going to places that you had experiences with them at, putting away old pictures where you won't be tempted to get them out until however long it takes you to get over them, and maybe even deleting their contact off your phone or off your friend's list on Facebook. It might seem rude, but you need to understand that you HAVE to move on in life."	You will eventually get struck or fined for staying in the middle of the road. You can move, but it takes effort (putting your foot to the gas.) Move on. You do not want to be the person stuck at the red light any longer. So if seeing them on your home page on Facebook or seeing them on your contact phone list will bring back sudden memories or you will be tempted to contact them, you need to delete them. Also, if you own anything of there's, it might be a good time now to give it back to them if it holds memories.

Shampoo properly. Apply a small, quarter-sized amount of shampoo to your scalp and massage vigorously with your fingertips. Then, work the lather through your hair and rinse. Rinse hair thoroughly so no shampoo is left behind. Washing your hair should take about five minutes. 2. Wash your hair every 2-3 days only. Even though greasy hair looks and feels dirty, washing your hair every day will make your hair more greasy because shampoo strips hair of its nutrients and natural oils, causing your scalp to produce even more oil. Wash your hair every 2-3 days at the very most. This gives your hair enough time to replace the natural oils, so you're not producing an excess. 3. Use different types of gentle shampoos. In addition to not shampooing every day, use a gentle cleansing shampoo. Shampoos that are aggressive tend to irritate hair follicles, causing the scalp to produce more oil. Also, switch shampoos once every week to avoid buildup. * Shampoos with salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, or ketoconazole are good for greasy hair. * Salicylic acid helps reduce oil on the scalp. * Keep 2-3 different shampoos in the shower so you can easily switch back and forth. 4. Condition less often. Oily hair does not need to be conditioned often. Condition every other time you wash or just once a week.	.

Pick a country. There are many countries with rainforests, and each has special features that make it unique. One of the most popular rainforest destinations is Costa Rica and Brazil because of its variety of tours and hotels, but there are numerous other countries with rainforest in Central America, South America, Africa, Oceania, and Southeast Asia. 2. Make reservations. Hotels, rental cars, and flights are all available at major ‘travel’ sites, like Expedia or Travelocity. If you search for hotels in your destination country you should be able to find some pretty exotic ones. 3. Make an itinerary for your visit. Think about the different types of tours, going to the beach, visiting museums, and sightseeing in towns. 4. Make sure that your passport is up to date because without it you aren’t going anywhere. If it’s not up to date or you don’t have on the is key to do right away because they can take a long time to come in the mail. 5. Get up to date on your shots and vaccinations. Check for travel clinics in you area at and for look for tips about preparing to be in the rainforest and staying healthy while traveling visit. 6. Go to your local library or to a bookstore to look for travel guidebooks and for a phrase book in the native language. Some big brand names for travel guidebooks are DK Eyewitness Travel and Fodor's. For phrase books check out Berlitz. Also, for overachievers try CDs to immerse yourself in the language. 7. Go to AAA (triple a) to exchange your money. Traveler’s checks are no longer widely accepted. Try to get cash but also get a debit card to use at ATM's to get cash there and to use in stores where they are accepted. Don’t wait until the airport to exchange currency because exchange rates tend to be higher. 8. Make a list of everything you need to pack. Plan for hot, humid weather, and of course, rain. Also, make sure to take into account bugs. Mosquito netting is definitely a must. Check off your list as you go, making sure you don’t miss anything. Make another copy of the list to check off when you come backs so you don’t leave anything. 9. Look at Consular Information Sheets and also understand the laws of the country that you’re traveling to. Better safe than sorry. 10. Tell friends and family where you will be staying in case of emergency and also register at the US Embassy or consulate before leaving. This means that the embassy or consulate will know where you are and can assist you in the event of an emergency. Also think about travel registration, which will allow the State Department to help you if an emergency arises. 11. Get to the airport early (and DON’T forget your passport). International airports are larger and harder to navigate then local ones. 12.	Carry a bag for garbage with you and dispose of it in the proper receptacles.
Play_Cut_Throat_in_Billiards.txt	Begin_Revision	0.867	### Knowing the Rules of the Game	1369	In addition , one ball from each of the opponents ' groups of balls that has been pocketed is brought back into play .	### Knowing the Rules of the Game	1428	One ball from each of the opponents ' groups of balls that has been pocketed is brought back into play .	<delete><In><1>|||<delete><addition><2>|||<delete><,><3>|||<replace><one><4><One><1>	True	Knowing the Rules of the Game  1. Know which balls are used. In Cutthroat billiards, the standard set of numbered 1-15 balls, plus a cue-ball are used to play the game. The numbered balls are split into three sets, and each set will belong to each of the three players. * The first set has balls 1-5, the second set has balls 6-10, and the third set has balls 11-15. * The object of Cutthroat billiards is to pocket all of your opponent's balls and be the only player with balls from your group remaining on the table. 2. Determine who will break. The shooting order is determined by lagging. One at a time, each player should take turns shooting the cue ball towards the foot cushion of the table. The balls will bounce back toward the head end of the table. Whichever player's ball ends up closest to the head end of the table has won the lag. * The player who is third in the shooting order will rack the balls, while the first shooting player will break them. 3. Decide whether players will call shots or not. Calling shots means naming the ball and the pocket you intend to shoot the ball in. In games where you have decided to call shots, you must name the ball and pocket accurately for each shot, or it will not count. 4. Learn the fouls of the game. A legal shot requires that the cue ball is used to contact the numbered balls. On all shots, players must cause the cue ball to contact an object ball. Any legally pocketed ball allows the shooter to continue at the table until they fail to pocket a numbered ball. Other fouls including scratching, hitting the balls of the table, and pocketing your own balls. * If player pockets their opponents’ ball on an illegal shot, the shot doesn't count. If the player pockets his own ball on an illegal shot, the ball remains pocketed and their turn ends. * Numbered balls that are hit off the table are considered foul, and the penalty for fouls is followed. The next player accepts the cue ball in the current position. * If the cue ball is scratched or jumped off the table, the incoming player gets the cue ball and can place it anywhere behind the head string. 5. Know the penalties of a foul. Whenever a player commits a foul, their turn ends.	This allows players who were eliminated to be reinstated at any time until the game is over. If a player’s group has no pocketed balls at the time of a foul, then the penalty has no effect on that group or player.

Limit your exposure to hospitals. Acinetobacter bacteria pose very little risk to healthy people within their day-to-day lives. However, very ill people within hospitals, particularly if they have weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease or diabetes, are much more susceptible to Acinetobacter and risk dying from the infection. As such, the goal is to avoid being in an intensive care unit (ICU) as a patient or visitor. * Most people admitted to the ICU have little chance of preventing it, but following medical advice for any chronic lung diseases or diabetes can prevent your condition from taking a turn for the worse and needing emergency care. * Getting transferred out of the ICU into another part of the hospital for recovery may also reduce your risk of an Acinetobacter infection. Ask your care givers about your recovery options. * Healthy people aren't normally at risk, but visiting ill relatives at hospitals can increase it, especially if you spend significant time in the ICU. 2. Wash your hands frequently. A crucial way for reducing your risk of getting any type of bacterial or viral infection while staying in a hospital (or visiting one) is washing your hands properly and frequently. Wash your hands after going to the bathroom and after you touch any person (patient or hospital staff) or surface outside the bathroom. Be especially cautious with door knobs, light switches, bed railings, curtains, bedside tables and any type of medical equipment. * Warm water and regular soap is probably enough to sanitize your hands from bacteria, but consider using an alcohol-based cleaner also. * Use the paper towel you dried your hands with as a barrier against door knobs and bedside rails. Once you climb back into bed (as a patient), throw the paper towel away in the garbage. * Make sure to have some hand sanitizer within reach of your hospital bed at all times. 3. Stop touching your eyes and mouth. Even if you're frequently sanitizing your hands as a patient or visitor to the hospital, try not to habitually touch your face (especially your mouth and eyes) with your hands. Bacteria on your hands are usually harmless, but they can enter your body through your mouth or eyes and become infectious. As such, focus on keeping your hands by your sides or on your lap. * If you don't wear eyeglasses, consider putting on some plastic eye protection to prevent touching or rubbing your eyes. * If you're a woman, be very cautious about transmitting bacteria (and other germs) while putting on eye make-up and lipstick. If you're a hospital patient, it's safer not to wear any make-up. 4. Avoid touching hospital patients. While in a hospital, it may be tempting to compassionately touch patients, but that dramatically increases your risk of Acinetobacter infection — particularly if you're also a patient and quite ill. Hospital patients can harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria (such as Acinetobacter) on their skin, clothing or personal items. * Talking, listening and supporting hospital patients is certainly helpful, but avoid touching them, especially if they're in the ICU. * If you're a patient in a hospital, avoid sharing any towels, washcloths, razors or clothes with other patients. * Acinetobacter spreads to susceptible patients by person-to-person contact or contact with contaminated surfaces. * If you're near a coughing patient(s), consider wearing a surgical mask for additional protection. Bacteria can travel within droplets of saliva / mucous. 5. Never touch any equipment or machines. Whether you're a patient or a visitor, never touch any medical equipment or machines while in a hospital or clinic setting, especially while in an ICU or emergency ward.

Check Tire Pressure  Why? Riding on under-inflated tires can cause flats and damage your wheels. And pumping up tires is a lot easier than fixing bent wheels. How? It's hard to tell with your thumb if a tire is under-inflated, especially on narrower, higher pressure tires. Instead, use a pressure gauge or a floor pump with one built-in. What if there's a problem? It's good to know how to change a tube yourself, and a lot of you reading this probably already do.	Rear wheels can be a little tricky to remove and install because of the chain & derailleurs. Mechanic's Tip: Don't just throw a new tube into the tire without finding out what caused the flat - if the sharp object is still stuck in your tire, it will be happy to flat yet another tube. Safety Pointer: Under-inflated or over-inflated tires can both cause accidents, though it's more common with under-inflation.

Spread a strip of pâté across the centre of the pastry, the same width as the beef fillet. Then spread the cold mushroom stuffing over the top of the pâté. 5.

Put the information in a rhyme. Using rhyming and even melodies can help you remember facts. By incorporating rhythm or the tune of a simple song into your memorization you can also help your understanding of how key events, people, dates, etc. fit together. * The old grammar rhyme “I before E, except after C” is a great example of how rhyming can help commit things to your long-term memory. 2. Make up a mnemonic device. By taking the first letter of a series of related key words and using to invent a silly and memorable phrase, you can recall things in a specific order. This can be especially useful when trying to remember things in the order in which they happened. * For example, ""King Philip Cried Over Forgetting Green Shoes"" is a mnemonic device for remembering the scientific classification system: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. 3. Use your other senses to trigger your memory. If you study while smelling a certain notable scent (like rosemary, for example), and then use that scent later when you need to recall the material, studies suggest you’ll have a greater recall ability. * Similarly, studying while listening to calm music can help you recall the material again later. 4. Use visualization. When trying to commit a fact to memory, try to associate it with an image in your head. It may even help to draw the image out if you are a really visual learner. The image doesn’t necessarily have to be direct in its meaning. * For example, if trying to learn facts about the Boston Tea Party, you might picture a Red Sox mug filled with hot tea. 5. Use the loci method. An ancient memorization technique, the loci method has you construct a ""memory palace"" using a building you know well (like your home). You then associate different facts or phrases with a different part of your home as you would normally walk through it. *"	.

The basics. Make sure the basics in your room look good. The basics include your bed and nightstand, your desk and closet. Make sure they look good. They don't even have to look incredibly expensive, but just make sure they look decent and clean. Also make sure the color of the basics and the style sort of match. 2. Make sure the colors in your bedroom work well together. It's best to have 2 or 3 colors in your bedroom. I advise to look to the furniture. If all your 'basics' are white and you have a wood floor or neutral carpet, you're lucky. You can put any colors with it. If for instance, your carpet is dark blue, start from there. Add whites and black and keep it in those colors. If your walls are for instance yellow(like mine ones were) add white/black or other pastel colors. That way, you make sure your bedroom looks more chic and mature if the colors match and if you use the least amount of color. 3. The key for a chic and elegant room is to keep it simple. No clutter, don't stuff it with furniture. In this case less really is more. The less you have in your room, the better. So don't be afraid to throw away stuff you don't need or doesn't look good anymore or just looks messy. And if you have doubts about putting in an extra decoration, you probably shouldn't. 4. Make your bedroom about a few statement pieces. Try to keep out the little clutter-y knickknack decoration thingies. Those look childish, messy and just makes it look like you're trying too hard. So for example, instead of having a lot of posters or postcards on your walls, put up one or two big black-and-white pictures in a frame. Or try to hang a couple of matching photo- frames in one area instead. 5. Organize. Make sure everything has its place. For example, if you used to have your shoes laying around in your bedroom or just standing in a line on the floor, buy a shoe rack and they will get much more positive attention. Same goes for makeup and hair-products. It's so much better to put them in a drawer than to have them standing on that dresser while you could have just put your prettiest perfumes on a platter with a pretty vase and flowers on there. Try to keep a lot of stuff in your drawers to make it look as if it's a hotel room. 6. Make sure the accessories in your bedroom look expensive. They don't have to be expensive. But just look for the stuff that looks the most expensive. Examples of expensive looking things in your bedroom are silk bedding, mirrored surfaces, crystal lamps, white flowers, big statement pieces like a big bedside lamp, etc. You can find these type of things at stores like Ikea and others for low prices. 7. A good rule to follow is to not let stuff lay on the floor. Except if it's a decoration like a floor lamp or a tower of boxes. Keep your shoes in a shoe rack or in your closet, keep piles of schoolbooks in your dressers etc. 8. Be smart with exposing your stuff. For instance, if you have a trashcan with an open top, keep it behind the door instead of at the wall you see when you walk in. Put all the beauty products in drawers. Make sure you show people the prettiest things you own only. 9. Don't look like you're trying too hard. It's one of the biggest mistakes people make when trying to get a chic bedroom. Don't make your bed too neatly. Don't try to over decorate your room with cheap-looking things like Christmas-lights, or put a lot of decorations on your bedside-table. Like I said, less is more. So don't make your bed too neat, if you are going for the effortless chic look.	.

That way, you make sure your bedroom looks more chic and mature if the colors match and if you use the least amount of color. 3. Keep it simple. No clutter, don't stuff it with furniture. In this case less really is more. The less you have in your room, the better. So don't be afraid to throw away stuff you don't need or doesn't look good anymore or just looks messy.	.

Know your medication. Research it, read about it, know its history. Some medications make seem safe, non-addicting, but unless it has a decent safety profile of non-addiction, and a lengthy or well-researched history, there's no guarantee. Every prescription comes with a medication fact sheet. If you don't get it, ask for it. Every pharmacy has ready copies. They can also be downloaded and printed at any public library. 2. Familiarize yourself slowly. Always take as prescribed. Often the prescription will call for starting at a low dose so as not to build a tolerance or toxify the body, and be sure to work yourself up to an ideal dosage exactly as instructed. If, and when, you are taken off the medication, you will wean off the same way, gradually. 3. Beware the of circumstances. Certain medications may be taken for special purposes such as periods of high stress. This is not the normal use for medications, so don't expect it. Occasionally, under special circumstances this is alright, but understand that this use is short term only. It will be prescribed and carefully supervised. 4.	Have periods of time which you abstain from all medication usage, if it's allowed by your physician, and constantly evaluate your medication habits. Don't be afraid to seek help if you think you might have begun down the path of addiction.

Recognize you have choices. Martyr syndrome is often marked by a feeling of helplessness. You may feel you are inherently the victim in life and that will not change. While there is a lot one cannot change about any given situation, learn to recognize where you can make choices. This will help you feel more in control of your life. * For example, everyone finds their job stressful at times. Having to do things you dislike at work is part of life, and you cannot fully control stressful situations from occurring. However, you can control your reactions and coping mechanisms. * The next time you encounter stress at work, pause and remember you have choices. Think to yourself, ""I can't completely get rid of these stressors, but I can control how I react. I can make a choice to stay calm and deal with this effectively."" 2. Stop expecting to be rewarded for your suffering. Some people volunteer to endure pain and neglect with the hope of being rewarded somehow. People feel that being a martyr will lead to things like recognition, love, or other rewards. Think about how you expect to be rewarded for your martyrdom. *"	You may find yourself putting a lot more into a relationship than you're receiving. Oftentimes, people feel giving and giving to difficult people will eventually result in those people changing and becoming more loving and caring.

Figure out why you want to use mantra meditation. Every person has a different reason for meditating from health benefits to attaining a spiritual connection. Figuring out why you want to use mantra meditating will help you identify the best mantras to chant and time to dedicate to your meditation practice. * There are many different health benefits to mantra meditation including lower blood pressure and heart rate, decreased anxiety and depression, less stress, and greater feelings of relaxation and general well-being. * Mantra meditation can also have spiritual benefits such as liberation your mind and letting go of the attachment to things you can’t control. 2. Find an appropriate mantra or mantras for your intention. One of the goals of chanting mantras is to feel their subtle vibrations, which can help you effect positive changes and enter a deep state of meditation. Can do silently or sing mantra. Each mantra has different vibrations and you want to find one that corresponds to your intention. * Repetition of mantras can help you disconnect from any thoughts that arise during meditation and also help keep you focused on your intention. * Some examples of powerful mantras include: * Om or aum is the most basic and powerful mantra you can chant. This universal mantra will create powerful, positive vibrations in your lower abdomen. It is often combined with the mantra “Shanti,” which means peace in Sanskrit. You can repeat aum as many times as you wish for your chanting. * Maha mantra, which is also called either the great mantra or Hare Krishna, can help you achieve salvation and peace of mind. Repeat the entire mantra as many times as you like. It’s words are: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. * Lokah samastha sukhino bhavantu is a mantra of cooperation and compassion and means “May all beings everywhere be happy and free, and may the thoughts, words, and actions of my own life contribute in some way to that happiness and to that freedom for all.” Repeat this mantra three or more times. * Om namah shivaya is a mantra that reminds us of our own divinity and encourages self-confidence and compassion. It means “I bow to Shiva, the supreme deity of transformation who represents the truest, highest self.” Repeat the mantra three or more times. 3. Set an intention. No mantra meditation practice is complete without first setting an intention. By taking a few seconds to dedicate your practice to something, you may be able to focus more intently and achieve a deeper state of meditation. * Lightly touch the bases of your palms, then the palms themselves, and finally your fingers to make prayer hands.

It takes a bowl, some stuff you were going to throw away and a touch of living vinegar to make something that will give your food a ton of flavor.	We entertain a lot. Or we did, in the period between crazy and über-crazy (aka parts of the last two years). These days our gatherings consist of having a couple friends over for dinner when we can scrape together the collective energy to mop our floors and vacuum our couch. But our favorite kind of party is the kind that I used to blog about. We call it Brunch ‘Til Dawn. Although the title is somewhat self-explanatory, I’ll explain. We have a brunch to celebrate something, but we make enough food to feed 20-25 people two to three times because typically we start at noon and go to the wee hours. There is likely be some form of Kinect dancing, along with some karaoke, if I have my druthers. There could be jai alai in the street, depending on the hour and the mood of the crowd. There will definitely be copious amounts of food and drink. And inevitably, my husband and I will be too tired to do all the party clean-up before we crash out for the night/morning. This lazy practice has led to more than one quarter-full bottle of decent or (*sobs*) excellent wine ending its life open on the counter for too many hours. But I’m nothing if not optimistic. When life (or my own bad habit) gives me wine that’s been exposed to too much oxygen, I make vinegar. I think you should too. Wine VinegarYields ~1 cup vinegar (expect some evaporation). Can be scaled for any amount of leftover (or even just-opened) wine. Contrary to what I’ve read in several places, you inno way need a physical mother of vinegar to make your own batch. Real, living (not pastuerized) vinegar will definitely do the trick as a starter. For my first batch I used Bragg’s, but ever since then I’ve used my own. I eventually made a batch of vinegar that spontaneously grew its own mother and now I get a new mother forming on the surface of my vinegar every so often, whether I use one to kick off a new batch or not. I like to make small quantities of this with whatever I have left after a fête. Give it a mix whenever you think of it. Air is your friend. The acetobacter (not a typo) responsible for vinegar fermentation are abundant in the air, and they need oxygen to survive, so mix those guys in and enjoy the tasty, tasty product.

Isolate new birds. When you get a new parakeet, isolate it from your other birds for a period of time. Isolating the bird keeps it from introducing diseases to your other birds. * Keep a new bird in a separate cage and separate room for about 4 weeks, watching to see if any diseases develop. Ideally, the bird would be kept at another location or in a room that has a separate ventilation, as diseases can be spread through the air conditioner, as well. * The best way to tell if a bird has a disease is to visit a vet within a week of getting the bird. The vet can screen for certain diseases and give you an idea of what treatment the bird will need if it does have a disease or tell you if you need to return it to where your bought it. She can also give you an idea of how long you will need to continue the quarantine. 2. Clean meticulously. When you have a new bird, make sure to clean its cage last, so that you don't spread its germs to your other birds. Clean out the cage daily, of course, but also make sure to disinfect the whole cage more often when you have new birds. 3. Don't cross-contaminate. Feed the new bird last, so you don't bring its germs over to your other birds. In addition, make sure you don't switch out the new bird's dishes with the other birds' dishes. * Always wash your hands or change gloves between cages. 4. Quarantine any returned bird. If your bird escapes, you of course want to try to find it.	.

Next, place the lid on (but not tightly, you don't want an explosion but you DO want to keep the steam and popcorn in) and microwave for roughly 3 minutes. Every microwave is different.

Melt roughly 2 tablespoons of salted butter in the microwave, and drizzle on top of the popcorn. Toss it all together to coat each piece, and finally season to taste with popcorn salt. 5.

Research the employer. At the very least, this means checking out the company's website and reading any ""About Us"" or ""History of"" pages. Pay special attention to the company's mission statement and future goals, since you can focus on answering questions in a manner that will address these concerns. * Knowing about the industry in general is also a good idea. The more informed you appear, the better the interviewer will think of you. * Make sure you know who the interviewer is. Knowing who to ask for, what his or her job title is, and how to address him or her will give the interviewer a more positive impression of you. * If possible, do not stop at the company's webpage. Read any articles that you can find about the company and talk to current employees or others in the industry who know more about the company. 2. Memorize the job description. You do not need to know it word for word, but it wouldn't hurt, either. If there is a job description posted online, make sure you read each requirement and responsibility. Be ready to address each one and to talk about past experiences or current skills that address each point. Knowing what a company wants will allow you to pitch yourself as the person who can meet those wants. 3. Practice answering some basic interview questions. An interviewer might throw out a question or two that you will have no way of anticipating, but in general, most questions asked at a job interview are pretty much the same. Write out at least five to ten potential questions you might be asked. Practice giving answers that address your career goals and qualifications. * ""Tell me about yourself."" The interviewer is essentially asking you to provide a professional overview of yourself. Briefly describe your past work experiences, how you got into the field, and any other information that describes your connection to the industry. If you mention anything personal, keep it brief and tailor it to demonstrate your overall character. * ""What is your biggest weakness?"" Give a genuine interest, but phrase it in a way that dampens the effect. Also provide a quick explanation on how you have learned to deal with it. For instance, if you have crippling shyness, you can answer, ""I tend to have trouble communicating with people at first, but as a result, I've learned how to observe people more thoroughly so that I know how to best interact with them after the first few encounters."" * ""Where do you see yourself in five years?"" This question can be difficult to answer since you need to seem both motivated and stable. If this is a company you plan to work for long-term, make sure that the interviewer knows this, but describe your desire to contribute and advance within the company. If the job is only temporary, say so, but make sure you describe what you aspire to reach after leaving the job and what you hope to have contributed after you go. * ""Why do you want this job?"" This is your chance to show off your knowledge of the job description and the company. Show how the company's values align with your own. If it is a fast-paced company that hopes to advance quickly, express a desire to advance along with it. If it is a company dedicated to a cause, describe your passion for the same cause. 4. Prepare your own questions. At the end of the interview, the interviewer will probably ask you if you have any questions of you own. Never shrug this off, since it could be interpreted as a lack of interest on your part. Ask questions about office culture and questions that clarify what your job responsibilities would be. Also find out how soon you can expect to hear back from them. 5. Prepare a professional outfit. As a general rule, wear clothes that are one step more professional than the position demands."	If the employees already wear fully professional attire, though, then show up in the same. Make sure that all your clothes are washed and ironed for the interview so that you look your best.

When no one is occupying your vacation home in the summer, set the thermostat at 78-80 degrees. Higher and the AC will not dehumidify effectively. Set it lower and you create cold surfaces where moisture can collect. 2. Make sure you look for standing water around refrigerators, toilets, water tanks, washers, anywhere water is used before you leave. Toilets Know that the source of water leakage can be caused by faulty supply lines, fill valve assembles, or toilets that are backed up and overflowed. Make sure that if the bowl or tank begins to overflow, turn off the water at the supply valve. Washing Machines: A burst water supply line cause half of all water damage incidents.Try leaving a 4-inch gap between the back of the washer and the wall to avoid kicking the hose near the valve connection. Water Heaters: The average lifespan for a water heater is about 5 years until it begins to leak or burst. Make sure to remove sediment by flushing the tank every six months, especially in areas with hard water. Shower Stalls: Most of these incidents involve a faulty shower pan. If your home is more than 15 years old you have 37% higher chance of water damage involving a shower. Test the shower pan annually and make sure to inspect the tile and grout every six months, and repair if there are any cracked lines.   1. Have a humidistat installed for the time you are not there. Set it to override the thermostat. When the relative humidity in the house exceeds 60%, it will turn on your AC to draw the moisture out of the air. 2. If your indoor humidity is over 60%, have your AC unit checked. Most of the time when an air conditioner isn't properly dehumidifying the indoor air it is because its cooling capacity is too great. The air cools and shuts off the cooling system before the humidity has dropped. 3. Eliminate clutter: Make sure that furniture or draperies are not blocking AC grills. Keep the air moving freely in every part of the house. Furnishings and draperies that block air supply grilles cause condensation.

Is she sitting down, standing up, on the street, coffee shop, or grocery store? If she’s in a dark parking lot, it’s probably not the best time to approach her. If she’s crying on the phone with her friends, again not the best time to approach her. Assess what she is doing and base your approach on that. 2.

If she is sitting in a park relaxing, come in with a relaxed state but add a little bit of energy to it.

One ¼ ounce package active dry yeast 4. tablespoons warm water 5. ¾ cup warm milk 6. ½ tablespoons margarine or butter 7. egg 8. ⅓ cup granulated sugar 9. teaspoon salt 10. ¾ cups all-purpose flour 11. cups vegetable oil 12. Preparing the Dough 13. In a medium bowl, dissolve the ¼ ounce package of yeast in 2 tablespoons of warm water. 14. Water should be at least 98 degrees 15. Add 2 ½ tablespoons of margarine or butter, ⅓ cups of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, and ¾ cups of warm milk to the yeast mixture, blending until smooth. 16. Milk shouldn’t be too hot, 30 seconds in the microwave is just fine. 17. Blending can be done with a dough mixer or an electric mixer. 18. Add 1 ⅜ cups of flour to the mixture and mix for 30 seconds. 19. Knead the remaining flour into the mixture until the dough is smooth 20. Cover the bowl of dough and place it in a warm place until it rises to twice its original size. 21. Check after 1 hour, if you poke the dough and an indentation remains then the dough is ready for tieing. 22. Tieing the Dough 23. Separate the dough into 16-24 round pieces. The size can vary to liking. 24. Roll out each piece until it is stretched about 12 inches in length. 25. Each end should be twisted in the opposite direction to create more texture and tension. 26. Release both ends of the twisted dough. The dough should turn on itself and create the iconic “twist”. 27. Set each twist aside for 10-15 minutes so the dough can rise higher. 28. Frying the Dough 29. Heat one inch of oil in a deep heavy frying pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).	.

Fight your way forward with running plays. Generally the most common type of play seen in football is the running play. Running plays tend to yield less yardage per play than passing plays, but are much less likely to accidentally transfer control of the ball to the other team. They have the added advantage of getting the football out of the quarterback's hands quickly, before an aggressive defense can reach his position and cost the team extra yards. If the ball is dropped during a running play, it is called a fumble. A fumbled ball can be picked up by the other team to gain control of it. * The quarterback normally hands the ball off to a teammate (typically a running back) to execute a running play, but he can also choose to run the ball himself. Being able to think quickly and assess the situation as it changes is a vital skill for a quarterback to help him decide when to run the ball on his own. * Running plays have the benefit of being difficult to see in detail from behind the defensive line. Very often, the offense will try to trick the defense by seeming to hand the ball off to two or even three different runners. When the ruse works, the one runner who actually has the ball can sometimes break past the defense before they know what has happened and run all the way down the field for an easy touchdown. 2. Pierce the defense with passing plays. Slightly less common than the running play, the passing play is a great way to make up lost yards quickly... if the pass is completed. Short passing plays are often used in combination with running plays as well, to keep the defense on its toes. The great advantage of a passing play is its ability to completely circumvent a tough ground defense. Incomplete passes (wherein nobody catches the ball after it is thrown) stop the clock and end the play. * The quarterback usually needs more time to throw a pass than is required for a running play, so the offensive line must be exceptionally unyielding while the quarterback scans the field for an open receiver in order to prevent him from being sacked (tackled behind the line of scrimmage while still holding the ball). Once an opening is spotted, the quarterback has to estimate how far to throw the ball so that the receiver will be able to catch it while in motion. * If a pass is caught by the defense, it is called an interception. As with a fumble, when a pass is intercepted, the defense gains control of the ball (and becomes the offense). Just as importantly, the play is not over once the ball has been intercepted. The defending player who made the interception can (and often does) turn right around and run the ball back down the field for an exciting touchdown. 3. Combine passing and running plays. Your offensive team should plan to use a mixture of both running and passing plays in order to keep the defense guessing. Practice a few different formations with your team and get good at running them. The quarterback especially should practice throwing the ball accurately, as well as learning to make convincing fake handoffs to the running backs. As a rule of thumb, it's safer to start out with a couple of running plays until your team gets a feel for how the defense responds. A defensive team that's great at intercepting the ball might not have much going for it on the ground, or vice-versa. Adjust your mix accordingly. If you're playing defense, watch player positions carefully and try to anticipate whether the play will be a running play, a short pass, or a long pass so that you can defend against it as effectively as possible. And remember, nothing stops a play of any kind as quickly as sacking the quarterback, so if you see an opening, go for it. 4. Practice a lot. By far the best way to get better at playing football is to practice regularly. The game uses a special skill set that is not seen very many other places in life, so consistent work is required to improve the way you play. Practice with your team if at all possible. Practice holding the ball, catching the ball, and running with it; practice watching the other players so that you can change what you are doing based on what is happening elsewhere on the field. Strength and endurance training is very important, too.	.

Prepare care packages and send them to the person. Each item you shop for will allow you the opportunity to focus on the person, do something for her, and then send all that love to her. If you have children, set aside a night of the week that you and your children can make arts and crafts that can be included in the care package. 4. Do home improvement projects. Improve your living arrangements when a roommate is on vacation. Make your living environment something your roommate will be excited about when she returns. Even if it is simply cleaning and organizing, it will be an improvement. This will give you something to do, and the pay-off will be positive. * Add plants to bring in a living energy into your living space. * Clean the windows and screens. Everyone enjoys a clean fresh view outside. * Paint a fence that has gotten rusty. * Fix squeaky doors, leaking faucets, or take broken items to be fixed. * Improve the curb appeal of your house. Planting a few colorful plants in your walkway or placing a beautiful potted plant on your porch will brighten the situation. 5. Fill the time with a longer-term project. If your spouse is deployed tell her that you plan to complete a project like building a wood deck in the backyard. This will give you and the person something to look forward to and will give you accountability to live up to your promise.

Get a Passport. Passports can be obtained at post offices around the country. Travel visas should be obtained if staying less than 90 days. Citizens of the European Union, Monaco, Switzerland and San Marino may enter with their National Identity Card. 2. Bring traveler's checks or credit cards. Both are widely accepted in Rome, and paying with traveler's checks or credit cards will allow you to bypass currency exchange centers, which usually charge a fee. Newspapers in Rome will list the current exchange rate daily. 3. Pack a money belt. Rome is well known for its tourism, which brings along with it petty theft and pick pockets. Be sure to pack your money into a money belt or concealed pocket. 4. Bring clothing appropriate to the season. In the winter, Rome has an average temperature of 9 degrees Celsius, or around 48 degrees Fahrenheit so be sure to bring slightly heavier jackets and hats, gloves and scarves. Summers are dry and warm with an average of 26 degrees Celsius or 80 degrees Fahrenheit, so bring cool clothing, such as short sleeves and light shirts. 5. Bring comfortable shoes. When visiting Rome and sightseeing, one will most likely being standing or walking for extended periods of time. Bring tennis shoes or comfortable trainers to give your feet a break. 6. Bring proper clothing for religious sites. Rome has many religious attractions, including Vatican City and St. Peter's Basilica within.	.
Organize_Your_Locker.txt	Begin_Revision	0.943	## Steps	12883	And if you have a gym bag or purse , put that on the top as well .	## Steps	12969	If you have a gym bag or purse , put that on the top as well .	<delete><And><1>|||<replace><if><2><If><1>	True	Steps  1. Plan how much time you have to work on your locker. If you want to make minor changes, do so between classes, but keep in mind you might be late. If you need to tidy all of your possessions, take time when the area isn't flooded with people and you have time to concentrate on the task at hand. After school would be a great time to tidy up your locker. Also I recommend you to ask if your locker partner will be there with you so you don't throwaway any thing they might need. * If you are cleaning a locker at work you should try to do this when it isn't interfering with your work duties. Stay late or arrive early. Consider stopping in on your day off. 2. Take out everything you have in your locker. Organize these things into three piles:  * Everything you are keeping in your locker * A trash pile * A pile for things that you want to take home or have to turn in 3. Soak a cloth in warm, soapy water, and clean the walls and floor of your locker. Use another cloth to dry it. If working with a wet rag is inconvenient you can bring a few of the pre-moistened, disposable cleaning cloths. Store them in a Ziploc bag if you don't want to bring the container. The Ziploc bag will prevent them from drying out. (This step is not necessary, but very helpful.) 4. Throw the trash pile away, and take care of the things you want to take home or turn in. Then sort the items you want to keep in your locker into groups again. Books, clothes, hygiene products, jewelry, and any other groups that you think are necessary. * If you don't need it or won't be using it for some time you should take it home for safe keeping. * Use extreme caution before keeping anything valuable in your locker. Most schools, sports clubs and work places can still gain access to your locker for security reasons. Not everyone is honest. Lockers are also commonly broken into, especially if you are known to keep valuables stored there. 5. Go through your locker every few weeks and purge of any old work, clutter and items to take home. This will prevent a build up of clutter and make it easier to find things. You can also take a few minutes every week to tidy up. 6. Make yourself a note of any items you need to bring from home. It's easy to remember cleaning items and pens as you're looking at your items but it is easy to forget when you're leaving the house. 7. Hang clothing and your backpack from hooks. If your locker doesn't have them, attach them yourself. You can find heavy duty hooks with the easy to remove adhesive in the home section or near the picture hooks at many stores. Get the ones that can hold heavier items. 8. Place your books upright on the bottom shelf, because they will break the top shelf from being too heavy, with the spines facing you. Order them in size, schedule, alphabetically, or by priority. Place your notebooks/binders on the top shelf of your rack. If you have any loose sheets of paper that you need, place them in a plastic folder, and put this on the second shelf. Think: heavy stuff on bottom, light on top.	Or better yet, hang it from a hook.

Find a quiet, relaxing atmosphere. It could be anywhere. Outside under a tree, in a bedroom with the lights off, or even in your living room. Anywhere that makes you feel comfortable is great. Make sure that there is no distractions in the area you have chosen and make sure there are no future distractions. You need to be focused on the here and now. 2. Find a comfortable position. Whether it would be sitting, laying down, or standing up the decision is up to you. Make sure that it's comfortable for you. Once you find your position, close your eyes. 3. Take in a deep breath. As you are in your position with your eyes closed, take in a slow deep breath. As you are taking in your breath, relax yourself. Loosen your shoulder and neck, wiggle your toes or fingers. Try to harmonize with your breath as you relax. Breathe in slowly, and as you breathe out, imagine all your stress and worries leaving your body whenever you exhale. 4. Try to clear your mind and avoid distractions, if you can. Put off any tasks that can wait until after you're done meditating. As you are taking in your breaths, let all your worries go. Stop stressing or thinking about commitments, appointments, and responsibilities. Save that for later. Instead, become self aware. Notice your breathing, your relaxation. Be in the moment and benefit from it. * Of course, if the phone rings, or you need to do any important task, then of course you can do so and can return to this meditation later. 5. Imagine yourself in a happy place. This may be from a holiday a few years ago, when you were younger and talking to your little sister, or simply sitting alone in a park. * Another option is to simply focus on what you are experiencing at the time. Focus on your breathing, what you hear, or smell. If another thought comes into your mind, gently push it away, and try not to start thinking about other things. This will get better with practice. 6. Close your eyes, continue to breathe deeply, and imagine all your body slowing down. Your heartbeat, your blood flow, all the way down to your feet. Continue imagining yourself in this place while breathing slowly for the next few minutes now. 7. Take your time. Don't worry how long you should meditate for. Keep meditating until you feel yourself relax and refreshed.	Once you feel like it's over, open your eyes and feel the benefits.

Prioritize healthy food. Packing a healthy lunch for your teen will ensure they get the right nutrition every day. If your teen does not have a packed lunch, they will likely buy fast food, which generally is not very nutritional. * Prepare lunches that are rich in vitamins and minerals. Include foods that are rich in nutrients like: iron to prevent exhaustion, like lean meat, leafy vegetables, etc.; zinc to prevent sickness, like lean beef, eggs, etc.; and omega-3 to prevent heart disease like salmon, tuna, etc. 2. Try to combine your teen’s favorite food with something healthy. This will serve as motivation for them to eat and enjoy their lunch. *	Instead of packing just fried chicken, make chicken wraps using pita bread filled with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, and cheese.

Set goals for yourself. Make life a challenge. It does not matter what you choose to do, but find something that challenges you. Push your limits. Not only will you be adding excitement to your life, you will also end accomplishing more than you ever thought you could. * Create a bucket list. You are never too young to start working on accomplishing all the things you wanted to do in your life. Do something you’ve always wanted to do. If there is something you have been meaning to try, now is the time. Go for it with all the gusto you have. * Make a to-do list every day. Make the most out of your day by focusing on how much you can accomplish each and every day. 2. Examine your routine. Is your schedule monotone and unchanging from each week? If so, dare to do something different. You may find excitement by just going in a different direction to work than you are used to. If you take daily walks, try a new route. If you always enjoy a certain meal at a restaurant, pick something else or even a new restaurant next time. These small variances from the norm can be just the pick-me-up you’re seeking. 3. Redecorate your home. Paint your walls or move your furniture. Switching things up around your home can be a fun project that keeps you busy. Creating a change in your environment can help bring about a change in yourself too. 4. Change up your style. This may seem a bit unnecessary, but a new look can lead to meeting new people, and maybe even a new job. In addition, you do not have to go from small town farm girl to late night clubber, or the other way around. Getting a new look can be as simple as trying a different haircut or color. * Wear what you like and don't worry so much about what other people think. When you stop caring if others are judging you for being you, life will seem more fun. * Go to a clothing store you like and ask an assistant to help you pick out clothes that are right for you. Try on some clothes that another person pictures you wearing and see how you like them. * If you don't know what kind of hairstyle you want, ask your stylist what they think would look best on you. And remember to put a little trust into them. They are a stylist; making people look good is their job. 5. Go out more. Make an extra effort to get out of the house. Whenever you walk out that door, the possibilities are endless. Make every outing a new adventure. * Go out with different friends than usual, or visit a nearby place you've never been before. It may seem a bit simple, but a changing your scenery can do wonders. 6. Make adventures a priority. If necessary, schedule excitement into your daily schedule. This will force you to take it just as seriously as your other commitments, but also give you an allotted time where your focus is solely on enjoying an adventure. Make the most of your weekends and time away from work. Don't let it slip away while you watch television. 7. Volunteer your time. You may think that volunteering is only about the giving of yourself for the good of others.	You may find that you genuinely enjoy helping other people, and you never know what you will discover while volunteering.

Learn what cities flights from Albany go to. There are direct flights from Albany to only a handful of cities, including Detroit, Atlanta, Chicago-O'Hare, Philadelphia, and Orlando. This airport might be smaller, but these bigger hubs can connect you to other locations around the country and world. 2. Recognize which airlines fly out of this airport. Albany has flights from the four big airlines (including United, Delta, American and Southwest), but there are also others - including JetBlue, Cape Air, CommutAir, Elite, and Boutique Air. 3. Get to Albany International Airport. Although its address is off Albany-Shaker Rd, just a 50-minute car ride from the connection point to both Interstates 90 and 87, the airport is actually two minutes off Albany-Shaker Rd on its own separate loop with a spur that sends cars into its parking garage. * Park your car if you need to. If you have a rental, park the car inside the rental car return (if this was a one-way rental). The rental car return entrance is off the backside of the parking garage, separate from the rest of the parking. * If you need extended parking more than a day or so, you can park on the 2nd through 4th floors. Single-day parking is allowed inside the garage with extended parking outside. There's also an Economy lot, but these lots are all a far walk from the airport and have little to no security. * Parking is free for the first thirty minutes and minimal per-hour up to the first 2 hours; then charges sky-rocket to per-day.	.

One value you can score in the lower section is a three of a kind. To score a three of a kind, you have to roll three of the same dice. * With a three of a kind, you add all the values of your dice together.

You'll have a better chance of remembering it that way. * You can also ask for a visual cue, such as a business card. * If you're really having a hard time getting someone's name, ask them to write it down for you. 2. Look closely at the person. When you're meeting someone for the first time, you may just glance at the person's face before moving on.	It's important to take a minute to really look at the person's face, and be sure to note any distinguishing features, such as remarkably blue eyes.

Instead of snacking, start excercising and don't give me any excuses. One, it helps create a better image. Two, better confidence. Three, it's scientifically proven to make people happier. Those three reasons should be more than enough to make you start moving, but if they don't this might: excercising doesn't have to be limited to your hosue or the gym. Go attend a class, do something you never done before, have fun (and you might find yourself another guy to ease the memories of the ex away) 2. Makeover: There's nothing like a good pampering to ease all the troubles away so SPLURGE! And while you're at the spa, stop by the salon and get a new haircut (by this I mean a new HAIRSTYLE not a trim). Oh, it's too expensive?	Even better? Get a group of friends and host a home spa. All you have to do is go online find some recipes, go grocery shopping (hint: more singles to interact with) and have a fun bonding moment with your friends (if you didn't dump them all when you got a boyfriend).

Make yourself as comfortable as possible. Gout often flares up at night, at that point, the weight of a blanket on a gouty toe, for example, can be extremely painful. If you know this is the case for you, and you have been having flare ups, then avoid that discomfort by turning up the heat in your bedroom and keep the blankets off your affected area. * You may be more comfortable, at least the first night, sleeping in an armchair or a recliner where you can keep the joint elevated. * If the gouty pain is in your toe, ankle, or knee, it may be best not to use a blanket or to tent the area over the joint if you can. 2. Get sleep conditions treated. Gout is also associated with sleep conditions, such as sleep apnea. If you have been awakened at night by gout in the past, talk to your physician about possible treatments for a sleep condition. * Make sure you avoid any stimulants, such as caffeine or tobacco, in addition to avoiding any purine-rich food or beverage. This will help you sleep more soundly.	While this won’t necessarily help you sleep in the immediate sense, but it will help flush out the uric acid that has built up.

Never try to remove rust by using abrasive cleaners. These will cause erosion of the glaze coat and if the surface is porcelain it can very easily allow lead to leach into the bath water. 2. The best rust removing agent on the market is an acid called hydrofluoric acid. It can be found at almost any Walmart. Simply look in the laundry stain removal section. Hydrofluoric acid is used to remove rust stains from laundry and it works great on Porcelain, Fiberglass, Cultured Marble and Acrylic Bathtubs, Tile and showers. 3. You will notice the Hydrofluoric Acid will be in a brown bottle and the labeled under the name WINK. It will have a squirt top on the bottle so when you squeeze the bottle the liquid ejects out. It will remove rust so quick, in most cases you can literally write your name in the rust. Start applying at the top of the stain and allow it to run down the stain. Only allowing it to set about 30 seconds. If it is going to work, it will work fast. If you have tried other cleaners first then it may have set the stain and simply will not work. However, I have successfully used this product literally hundreds of times over my career. 4. Make absolutely certain you are wearing thick rubber gloves. Never touch this chemical it is very dangerous. Simply squirt it on then allow it to work it's magic.	Cold water is a must. Not warm water, never hot water. Only cold water. You can repeat the process a few times if needed.

Then use no guard and start cutting the hair off slowly but surely. 5. Once all of the hair has been cut touch it up and make sure there are no patches of hair left on the head. 6. Now go into the bathroom, if not already there, and have your client moisten their head. 7.	.

Note how he behaves when you're out in public. When you are out, he watches you intently when you are conversing with others. Your initial thought is that he is admiring you. You carry on chatting. He doesn’t smile. The ‘admiration’ becomes an intense glare – maybe even gesticulating with his hand and pointing with two fingers to his eyes (I am watching you). He imagines that you will go off with one of the people you have been talking to. He has your attention again, and you wonder what you may have done wrong, smile and shrug it off jokingly – after all, part of life is conversation, laughter and generally feeling happy. Why should he have a problem? 2. Be wary if she makes some snide, undermining comment that leaves you questioning your own personality and perhaps wondering if you really are the tart /flirt / trollop / tease that she describes. 3. You are going for a night out with friends / family / work colleagues. He’s not invited. Not because he’s not wanted, just because that’s how things are. In the days leading up to the evening, he becomes grumpy, snappy. Everything you do is wrong. He belittles your every comment. Puts you down for no reason. Criticises you. 4. If you ask for his opinion about your attire prior to the evening. He may offer the following: * Are you sure you are comfy in that? * Perhaps it’s too short or revealing? * Have you got your sexy underwear on, just in case you pull? 5. He offers you the key to his home – to build up trust. You can come and go as you please – he has nothing to hide. There maybe a toothbrush at his, that he has personally bought for you – or a dressing-gown. Refusal is not an option. 6. You sense that he may be a little insecure about you going out and try to build his confidence and reassure him. You think he is wonderful and want the relationship to work. 7. He’ll check your phone. 8. Mind games are frequent. Conversation is turned on its head to the point you can’t remember exactly what you said, but you are in the wrong. You find yourself feeling guilty again and having to answer for, and justify your actions. 9. You are late home from work. 10. Therefore you have been sha**ing the boss in your sexy underwear (earlier question). Over the desk was it? No? Then you have been to the pub, or ‘you have started an affair – and it’s only a short time before you will end the relationship’. 11. Your confidence is nose-diving. 12. You end up spending more time with him than your family, because you want your relationship to be happy and don’t like upsetting him. 13. You doubt yourself as a person and maybe there is a possibility you will be ‘swooned off your feet’...you avoid such situations, so don’t venture out – it’s easier than the grief / conflict that ensues. 14. You really enjoy his company. When it’s just you and him and no outside influences, life is wonderful. You fall in love and want to be with him forever. 15. He is charming. 16. A proper Gent. 17. Pulls out the chair for you to sit down. 18. Opens the car door for you to get in. 19. Links your arm as you walk. 20. Holds your coat for you to put it on. 21. Anything at all you want to do is fine by him. 22. He has so many good points. 23. He likes cooking. 24. He adores spoiling you and buys you a beautiful piece of jewellery within months of you meeting – he knows a lovely jewellers... 25. Or an expensive dress, if you go out with him a little longer. 26. He has no objection to helping around the home. Doing DIY. Cutting the grass. 27. YOU ARE LOSING YOUR INDEPENDENCE. 28. Which, sadly, is the very thing that attracted him in the first place. 29. You spend entire weeks together. 30. He talks about moving in together. Things are going so well, you consider it. 31. Life is fantastic! 32. You have a man that adores you (and your child(ren)), but you haven’t been out for a drink with your mates for months. 33. He offers to lend you his car. It’s newer and smarter than yours...but if you are a minute late getting it back you are in such trouble. 34. Parents? 35. Piece of p*ss compared to this man. 36. Seven months into the relationship, you think the trust would be there. After all, you have given him no cause for concern. You love him – surely he knows that? 37. He offers to pick you up after an evening out with friends/colleagues. 38. You have had a good evening. 39. You are more than happy to discuss the events of the evening and the laugh you have had. 40. You are looking forward to snuggling up in bed together... 41. Laughter and good mood rapidly dissolve as he finds any reason to pick at you. 42. You have to work all weekend. It’s a one-off. 43. Now you are definitely having an affair. 44. You are also a liar – especially as your mobile phone ‘conveniently’ went flat / you didn’t answer his text within 10 mins. 45. He’s helped you out of a seemingly miserable existence and you should be grateful. 46. He wants the money back for the holiday you have booked – just in case you do a runner with his share. 47. Your heart is broken. 48. You are crying against the wall. 49. How can he not know you love and adore him, yet he chooses to blame you for his temper / anger? 50. He promises he will change. He doesn’t know why he is like this. Perhaps he loves you too much. It’s never happened before. He’s just frightened of being without you. 51. Xmas do – partners are not invited. Again, not because of anything, just the way it is. 52. Why? 53. What’s going off? “You came to mine. Why can’t I come to yours?” 54. How old is this man? 55. He deliberately tries to make you jealous. Chats intently, flirtily, sexily, happily to your friends. Wins over their respect and confidence – He is a good man. 56. Try to chat to his mates in the same manner? FORGET IT! 57. You have spent the weekend with your best mate of X years. 58. He refuses to let you see him once they have gone (good job he is Pinocchio, as he has just spited another piece of his nose) – just to get at you for your little misdemeanour. 59. Yes, you know you should get out of this unhealthy relationship, but there is a magnetic field surrounding this guy that keeps pulling you in. 60. It’s an elastic band that keeps stretching every time he hurts you. But it’s a big bugger and there’s a long way to go yet. 61. He believes you are avoiding him if you don’t respond almost immediately to his texts. The fact that you forgot your phone, it’s on charge in the other room, you didn’t hear it beep / ring is irrelevant. Once it’s repossessed / charged – it comes complete with a barrage of abuse. 62. He accuses you of affairs for no reason. 63. If you so much as mention a male college, he goes up the wall. 64. You are a stupid trollop / b**ch / cow / girl / kid. 65. You may wake up one morning to find him standing over you at the side of the bed. 66. It’s not love in his eyes. 67. Asks you how much for sex? A joke of course, but it doesn’t wear thin. 68. Red light would suit your room. 69. You are not comfortable with some of the sexual activities you are embarking on, but it’s ok. He loves you. 70. So when you endeavour to try something new as you have a confidence in the bedroom you never knew... 71. “Who taught you that? Your boss / friend?” 72. You are a dirty whore. 73. This man is supposed to love and adore you???? 74. Immediately you feel dirty, humiliated. 75. You change jobs / start a course, and immediately he thinks he is not good enough for you and you’ll end the relationship. 76. You reassure him nothing will change as it’s him you love and unless there is something wrong in your relationship, no-one else will be able to come between you. 77. He’s not reassured. 78. The topic raises its head on numerous occasions. 79. You tell him you love him – he goes quiet. Sends daggers your way. 80. He still wants to sh*g though – after all, he is a bloke and has needs. 81. It’s rough sex, like he’s trying to punish you. He loves you though. 82. He’s angry. But why? You haven’t done anything wrong except try to better yourself. Perhaps it’s for something you may do in the future...? 83. He likes to take photos during sex / of your private parts. He promises they are for his eyes only, and he will delete them. 84. They will come back to haunt you when he is texting nasty messages telling you to watch out for c**ts. 85. His jealousy is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 86. He keeps telling you that you will leave him, but he is doing nothing to keep you except push you away. 87. He’s been pushing the self-destruct button. 88. He believes he is keeping the relationship together. 89. Oh, by-the-way. He can’t live without you and may at sometime pretend to commit suicide, or play dead.	.

Create a business plan. Even if you only plan on running your house sitting business as a side gig, a formal business plan can help you organize your business and stay on track with your goals. * Creating your business plan also requires market research and assessment, which can help you create realistic goals for your business. 2. Scout out the competition. To get a good understanding of your earning potential as a house sitter, you need to look at what other house sitters are doing. This can help you adjust your expectations as well as pick up ideas to help grow your business. * Experienced house sitters based in a different region or country also may be willing to give you advice and help you get started. Look for people who you wouldn't be directly competing with for clients. 3. Investigate franchise opportunities. The beauty of a house sitting business is that there are virtually no start-up costs. Establishing and growing your business, however, takes a lot of time and effort. A franchise may cut some of this time and effort. * When you purchase a franchise, all the branding and much of the marketing typically already is taken care of. You also get the benefit of an established brand and reputation. * You can find house sitting franchises by searching online. Research every opportunity thoroughly before you commit any money to it. Make sure the franchise has a good reputation and will actually benefit you. 4. Choose a business structure. If you don't go through the formalities to establish a corporation or limited-liability company (LLC) to organize your house sitting business, it will be considered a sole proprietorship by default. * If you run your house sitting business as a sole proprietorship, the business will not be separate from your own personal finances. If something goes wrong on a house sit, the homeowner could sue you. * Organizing your house sitting business as an LLC would protect you by separating the business from your personal finances. If you're interested in creating an LLC, you might want to talk to an attorney or business advisor and find out what steps you need to take. 5. Register your business name. If you're going out on your own, you typically must create a business name that is unique to you and register that name with your state or national government. * For example, if you're in the United States you can go to the website of your state attorney general and access the business name database. Typically you can register a unique business name online after paying a small fee. 6. Get a tax ID number. You must pay taxes on any income you earn from house sitting. If you have your house sitting business structured as an LLC or a corporation, you'll need a tax ID for your business that's distinct from your personal tax ID number. * If you're running your house sitting business as a sole proprietorship, you'll typically file taxes on that income from your own personal return. You can still get a tax ID number for the business if you want, and you may need one if you plan to hire employees down the road. *	After answering a few questions about your business, your EIN will be automatically generated.
Replace_the_Honda_Accord_2000_Car_Radio_With_a_Bluetooth_Capable_System.txt	Begin_Revision	0.939	## Steps	257	Then attach the other end of the wiring harness to the back of the new radio .	## Steps	286	Attach the other end of the wiring harness to the back of the new radio .	<delete><Then><1>|||<replace><attach><2><Attach><1>	True	Steps  1. First check if the car has a standard or a double-wide radio (2x DIN - shown in the picture on the left). If it is a double DIN you will need an adapter kit from ebay or many online sites (shown in the right image). The Accord I have has a 1x DIN radio so did not need the install kit. 2. I bought a Dual MP3, WMA CD player with HD radio, a USB and AUX ports, and bluetooth capability for $119 (includes shipping). I also bought the bluetooth adapter for $39 (includes shipping) that goes with this radio. In addition I got a wiring harness adapter which connects the Honda radio plug to the new radio from Walmart for $6.00. The radio has preamp outputs to attach to an external amplifier, I have toyed with the idea of connecting these preamp outputs to a headphone jack so that you can connect headphones to listen in private to the radio but have not done so. 3. The radio wiring harness that came with radio is soldered to the Honda wiring harness. This was done by shortening the wires in the Honda harness by 6 inches so that there won't be too much of a mess when you pack the radio in the car. The wire ends were stripped on the cut Honda harness (the radio harness ends were already stripped and tinned, ready to be soldered). One inch length plastic shrink tubing was slipped over the wires. Wires of the same color code were joined together after checking that the color code for the new radio and the Honda wiring harness were the same (wiring table on the honda wiring harness packet). The Honda harness had two extra wires (orange and orange with stripe) that had no equivalent on the new radio. These orange wires were for dimming the radio lights. The corresponding ends of the wires were twisted together and soldered. The blue plug is the one that will connect with the wiring in the car and the black plug (to the right) will plug into the back of the new radio. The heat-shrink tubing was then slid onto the soldered joint and shrunk with heat from the soldering iron. Previous experience had shown that electrical tape was not good enough (see my article on replacing a radio for the toyota corolla). I did not clip of the preamp plugs, would recommend removing them though and covering them with heat-shrink tubing. 4. Now getting to the car, there are three screws to be removed, two on the bottom of the panel and one behind the clock. So first step is to remove the clock by gently prying it out with a thin screwdriver. The two plugs that go into the clock module are disconnected. The plugs have a small tab that you squeeze and then separate from the connector.Remove the clock and put it aside. 5. Remove the two bottom screws and the one from behind the clock.Gently pry out the panel. The panel is held by two clips on the top and two on the bottom. It does not take much pressure to pull this out. I did not unplug the wires attached to the back of the panel as they were long enough to let the panel be pulled out to the right. 6. Unplug the antenna and the wiring connector from the back of the radio. Unscrew the two screws on the left and two on the right and gently pull the radio and the bottom tray out as one piece. The radio itself is removed by unscrewing the two screws on the left and right side that attach the radio to the whole radio chassis. Slide the new radio in, align the holes in the radio with the old radio bracket and screw in the four replacement screws (short rounded heads) that came in with the radio. The original screws that I removed from the Honda radio were too big in diameter so had to use the ones that came with the Dual head unit. 7. Once the radio is attached to the chassis (left picture) plug in the wiring harness into the Honda plug that you had removed from the back of the Honda radio. Make sure that you remove the two screws attached to the top of the radio - these were to lock the CD drive during shipping. 8.	Also attach the antenna cable and the bluetooth cable. Slide the whole chassis in while making sure that the bluetooth microphone comes out from the bottom. I had decided to keep the bluetooth microphone just below the radio. Screw the radio chassis back in with the original screws. Place the panel back in to place. Tap gently to make sure that the panel has clipped in properly. Attach the bluetooth to the bottom of the radio (see picture) with the provided velcro/sticky tape.

Fats - 9 Calories per gram. Contrary to popular belief in today's society, fats themselves are not the very embodiment of nutritional evil; on the contrary, fats are essential to regulating many bodily functions, including hormones vital to weight loss. However, when making food choices, one should try to choose foods high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and low in saturated fats and trans fats. One handy trick to utilize when making healthier fat choices is to check the consistency of your food; mono and polyunsaturated fats - found abundantly in foods such as olive oil, flaxseed oil, avocados, and egg yokes - are generally liquids at room temperature, while saturated and trans fats are generally solid - think butter or animal fat. 4. Cholesterol and Sodium. Cholesterol, a waxy, fat-like substance found mostly in animal products, leads to a wide variety of health issues when overconsumed and should generally be avoided. Similarly, sodium - or salt - leads to water retention, bloating, and high blood pressure, and is hidden in a wide variety of foods. The FDA recommends eating less than 2300 milligrams of sodium per day and choosing low-sodium foods whenever possible. 5. Carbohydrates - 4 calories per gram. Broken down into up to three subcategories on a nutrition label - fiber, sugar, and added sugar - carbohydrates are your body's preferred source of energy. Fiber, a non-digestible form of carbohydrate found in foods such as fruits and vegetables, aids in digestion and should be consumed abundantly. On the other hand, sugars and especially added (or artificial) sugars, often lead to fat gain due to the rapid speed of their digestion. One should choose foods high in fiber while avoiding sugar, especially added sugar. 6. Protein - 4 calories per gram. Proteins, used by your body to form tissues, hormones, muscles, etc. are vital to a properly functioning body. Especially essential for growing children and teens, aging individuals, and athletes, protein is found in meats, eggs, beans, dairy, etc. One should choose high-protein foods whenever possible. 7. Vitamins and minerals. Integral to a healthy body, vitamins and minerals come from a wide variety of sources. Pay special attention to the percent values here to ensure that you are getting enough of these nutrients. 8."	Across from each molecule listed on a nutrition label is a percentage, which indicates what fraction of the FDA's recommended daily intake of specific nutrient the food provides. Pay attention to these numbers and let them guide your food choices.

Learn to act even when you're afraid. Part of standing for what you believe in is learning to be courageous. Courage doesn't mean you're not afraid. Many courageous people are afraid, but they act anyway because they know it's important. If you really believe in your cause, you need to act on it despite your fear. * Part of being courageous is picking a side. It's hard to act in the moment if you don't know what you stand for. For instance, if you don't know whether you're for or against an issue, such as women's rights, you may find yourself not wanting to speak up in conversation because you're on the fence. However, if you know where you stand, you'll be more inclined to speak about it. * Don't be afraid to ask for help. Sometimes, you'll lean on others to find your courage, and that's okay. The more people you have behind you, the braver you'll feel. * Focus on who you'll be helping. Often, when you're standing up for what you believe in, you're doing so to help others. Focusing on how they will benefit can help you feel more courageous. 2. Encourage your acts of bravery. If you're like most people, you likely commit small acts of bravery throughout your day without even realizing it, especially if you are a bit reserved. For instance, maybe you've been dreading a phone call you need to make, and you finally pluck up the courage and do it. Take a moment to acknowledge that you've shown a small act of courage. These small acts can inspire you to be braver in other areas, such as when you need to stand up for a belief. 3. Speak up for others who are unable to. Putting your beliefs into action often means standing up for others who can't stand up for themselves. Sometimes, people are unwilling or unable to speak up for themselves, and you need to step in. If you are going to say you believe in compassion, for instance, you must put into to practice when you see people in trouble. * For instance, you may need to step in when you see someone being bullied. Try to stop the bullying in its tracks by interrupting what the person is saying or by trying to separate the bully from the victim. If you're a kid, don't be afraid to ask an adult to help. Also, make sure the person is okay, mentally and physically. Get the person help if they need it. 4. Speak up when you see behavior that bothers you. Part of putting your beliefs into action is to speak when you see something that goes against your core values. Now is the time you start standing up, when something going on near you that you have the power to change. Take a deep breath, and get started. * Suppose you are out with some male friends and one of them makes a derogatory comment about an attractive woman nearby. You can ignore it or choose to take a stand. Ask your friend, “Is that how you try to get dates?” or “How would you like if I talked to your sister like that?” * By not ignoring behavior you find troubling, you can help spark conversation and possibly accelerate change. * Remember that silence often means approval. When there is a conflict around you, if you stay silent, people will think you agree with the status quo. 5. Be calm and non-confrontational while speaking up. When you speak up, how you say things matters. That is, if you get angry, other people tend to just hear the anger, not what you're saying. Plus, you're giving others permission to get angry, too. If you stay calm, you may be able to actually convince people to hear what you're saying, instead of just tuning you out. 6. Put your values and beliefs first. If you're going to stand up for what you believe in, you may need to make some sacrifices at times. You may lose some ""coolness"" points because people don't think the same way you do. You may even lose some friends or acquaintances. That doesn't mean you should beat people over the head with your values. Rather, sometimes when you stand up for a value, acquaintances may decide they don't share the same values. It can be hard, but putting your beliefs first will help you become a moral person. *"	For instance, if you are in a job that asks you to do things that go against your personal values, you may need to find a new job.

Breath a little. Even though you have all that work stewing in your head, you need to breath. Take a slow, long breath in through your nose, then gently exhale through your mouth. Don't let out a big, sobbing puff. Think of your breath as the wind. There is a tiny village sitting in front of your lips, and you don't want to blow too hard on the little people. Breath like this for five or more breaths when ever you are stressed. 2. Say it out loud. Even if there's no one listening, cheerfully chat to yourself about what you need to do, and how fun that report on Rome is going to be. negative things that are out in the open are neutralized, and you can breath them back in without getting poisoned. 3. Stay busy. While you may have been looking forward to slouching on the couch, stuffing your face with cheese puffs and getting orange powder all over the cushions, having this lazy time in the dark will gradually make you think littler of yourself. If your tired, read, nap, do yoga, stretch, or do something peaceful and creative. If you're up for it, jog, go on a brisk walk, anything to push off the laziness. 4. Break it down. While working hard on doing a heap of dishes or researching Amazon Plant Life, divide the work. Set a timer for ten to thirty minutes, and take five to ten minute breaks when the timer goes off. 5. Stay healthy. This means bathing or showering regularly, washing your hair, keeping your teeth clean, treating any conditions, and scheduling consistent doctor and dentist appointments. Keep a date book to organize any appointments. 6. Eat smart. This just means that instead of choosing Super Oozers for a juicy, oily hamburger, you should choose Salad Party. Don't go out of your way to make yourself super skinny. Don't think skinny- think healthy! Have a few snacks like fruits or nuts during the day, as well as lunch, breakfast, and dinner. Only eat when you're hungry, and drink plenty of water. You need eight cups of water a day to maintain a good balance of H20. You should check that your body is getting enough of every vitamin, as well. 7. Find your happy place. It may be sunning on a rock in your garden surrounded by flowers, or it may be snuggled into your mattress, dozing over a good book. It doesn't matte where it is, just that you get there at least once a week! Make sure that you quiet yourself every now and then and be grateful for all you have. This will leave you refreshed and with a pleased outlook on life. 8. Do something for yourself. Not often, but spend that extra buck when you need a manicure, or want to see the game. This is important, and remember that even tidying the house will have you smiling when the results are in. You are you, and you are worth it. 9. Accept yourself.

Breath a little. Even though you have all that work stewing in your head, you need to breath. Take a slow, long breath in through your nose, then gently exhale through your mouth. Don't let out a big, sobbing puff. Think of your breath as the wind. There is a tiny village sitting in front of your lips, and you don't want to blow too hard on the little people. Breath like this for five or more breaths when ever you are stressed. 2. Say it out loud. Even if there's no one listening, cheerfully chat to yourself about what you need to do, and how fun that report on Rome is going to be. negative things that are out in the open are neutralized, and you can breath them back in without getting poisoned. 3. Stay busy. While you may have been looking forward to slouching on the couch, stuffing your face with cheese puffs and getting orange powder all over the cushions, having this lazy time in the dark will gradually make you think littler of yourself. If your tired, read, nap, do yoga, stretch, or do something peaceful and creative. If you're up for it, jog, go on a brisk walk, anything to push off the laziness. 4. Break it down. While working hard on doing a heap of dishes or researching Amazon Plant Life, divide the work. Set a timer for ten to thirty minutes, and take five to ten minute breaks when the timer goes off. 5. Stay healthy. This means bathing or showering regularly, washing your hair, keeping your teeth clean, treating any conditions, and scheduling consistent doctor and dentist appointments. Keep a date book to organize any appointments. 6. Eat smart. This just means that instead of choosing Super Oozers for a juicy, oily hamburger, you should choose Salad Party. Don't go out of your way to make yourself super skinny. Don't think skinny- think healthy! Have a few snacks like fruits or nuts during the day, as well as lunch, breakfast, and dinner. Only eat when you're hungry, and drink plenty of water. You need eight cups of water a day to maintain a good balance of H20. You should check that your body is getting enough of every vitamin, as well. 7. Find your happy place. It may be sunning on a rock in your garden surrounded by flowers, or it may be snuggled into your mattress, dozing over a good book. It doesn't matte where it is, just that you get there at least once a week! Make sure that you quiet yourself every now and then and be grateful for all you have. This will leave you refreshed and with a pleased outlook on life. 8. Do something for yourself. Not often, but spend that extra buck when you need a manicure, or want to see the game. This is important, and remember that even tidying the house will have you smiling when the results are in. You are you, and you are worth it. 9. Accept yourself. Somebody, somewhere, would risk their life for you, your smile. So smile more often, and know that everything is balanced. Don't get plastic surgery, settle for something that makes you happy. The simple, sun beam, everyday, buttermilk pancake, fresh breeze, blue waters, I-think-he-likes-me kind of happy. 10. Go for it. You were put on this world for a reason.	So, go for it. THE WORLD IS YOURS.

Are you running short of time and getting worried probably because you have to make number of recruitment's for the long day? Want to choose a perfect employee for your company and find some peace in doing so? Then here is the answer, resume screening! Resume screening gives you an opportunity to handle your responsibility with ease. 2. Resume, which is nothing but a summary of your experiences and skills you possess, in relevance to the field of work or study that you wish to enter, is screened by most of the recruiters or hiring managers of various corporate offices, for an applicant with apt qualifications and good-to- have qualifications. 3. Let’s get into the details of “How to screen the resume?” resume screening is generally done by keeping few details in mind like apt qualifications, experience, work history, extra qualifications and skills. Make a check list of requirements for that particular job profile and proceed with the hunt for your perfect candidate. See that all the applications on your desk satisfy the requirements check list. Remove all those applications which fail in satisfying the requirements. Coming to the next step, sort all the applications under ‘yes’, ‘no’ and ‘may-be’ categories. Put all those people who absolutely satisfy all the requirements with some extra good qualifications for that profile.	And those with qualifications and some extra skills can be put into ‘may be’ category. Now depending on number of candidates required for the recruitment, people can be categorized and placed accordingly. By this time you must have surely narrowed the list of number of applicants.

Remove all those applications which fail in satisfying the requirements. Coming to the next step, sort all the applications under ‘yes’, ‘no’ and ‘may-be’ categories. Put all those people who absolutely satisfy all the requirements with some extra good qualifications for that profile. Later, all those who are not up to the mark go into the ‘no’ category. And those with qualifications and some extra skills can be put into ‘may be’ category. Now depending on number of candidates required for the recruitment, people can be categorized and placed accordingly. By this time you must have surely narrowed the list of number of applicants. 4. Coming to the third step of screening, give a point for the people with required qualifications and an extra point for those with extra qualifications. Then later on, rate each application by your checklist in both ‘yes’ and ‘may-be’ category and sum up for points at the end. Based on those points earned, you can screen the rest of them for that portal easily. Whoever scores well on the rate card put them into the final category of screening, according to the points earned by each. Lastly when you come to this category of final list, take second and look at the work history and experience of the candidates with good skills. Now here when you look into it precisely, eliminate people with bad work history records or say people who quit their jobs pretty frequently in short periods of time, gaps in employment, vague description of duties, grammar, etc, etc. Look out for the ones with a constant period of work history and skills. 5.	If you don’t find what exactly you are looking for, then see that you re- advertise for the same profile instead of choosing an unsatisfactory profile for your company.

Get talking first. Do the flirt thing--flip your hair, bite your lip, smile cutely, look at him through your lashes. If you guys are already dating/very close, this helps a lot and reduces the awkwardnesses. 2. Break the touch barrier. If you're sitting next to him, scoot closer until your thighs are touching lightly. If you are standing, sidle up to him slowly till you're about 6 or 7 inches away from him. You should be close enough to feel the warmth coming off him. Then gently touch his hand. 3. Slowly stroke his arms, then move your hands to his shoulders. Look into his eyes then lower your head, running your hands down his arms. Lean forward and into him a bit, not too hard--you don't want to push him over. He should lift his arms and put them around you. 4. Reach around him with your arms under his and pull him closer. Squeeze him gently, then rest your head against his chest. Reach up and ruffle his hair, then run your hands through it and down the back of his neck. Bring your hands around the back of his neck to his collarbone, then move your hands slowly down his chest. Put your arms around his waits and move them up his back. Place your hands just on his shoulder blades and lightly trace small circles with your fingertips.	Slowly but firmly, push your hips against his. Don't push too hard though--guys are pretty tender down there. Once your hands are at his hips, you can run two fingers slowly along the back waistband of his pants through his shirt (this works better for standing-up hugs). If he likes this (and seriously, what guy WOULDN'T like this?), you can go a bit farther. Push his shirt up gently until you can touch the skin above his waistband. Continue lightly grazing his skin with your fingers. If he liked the nails-down-the-back part, try the same thing here, with one or two fingers. Apply some pressure when your fingers run over his spine. You can also trace small circles here and there along the way. Keep the other hand around the middle of his back, pulling him towards you. ENJOY THE MOMENT--don't rush through it. Take time to explore him and find out what he likes. A good thing to do is to keep track of what he seems to like so you can remember what to do next time. P.S., if you're sitting, he may pull you onto his lap. Giggle if he does this. Guys think it's cute.

Source your eggs or larvae. You can either buy your eggs from online breeders. Or you can find your own caterpillars in the wild, however this takes a long time and you need to be able to identify the caterpillar in order to provide correct food plant. 2. Provide a Home. Cages must be well ventilated, to allow grass to dry out, and made of mesh, to prevent parasitic wasps from gaining access and killing your larvae. Though if you are serious about breeding butterflies and moths a screen terrarium is a good investment.Make sure your container is tall enough to hold tall living plants, and large enough that overcrowding of caterpillars does not occur. Remember that larvae can grow up to 10cm! 3. Hatch your eggs. Get a small tupperware box and line it with a sheet of toilet paper, gently lay your eggs onto this and close the lid. To provide oxygen and moisture, you should open the lid and breathe on the eggs twice daily. Do not put leaves in the box as the sealed environment can cause some species of plant to produce gases that can harm the tiny eggs. 4. Look after your larvae. After the eggs have hatched, leave them in the box to eat their eggshells. The eggshells contain nutrients that are essential for them to start eating. Lay some cuttings of privet (or other foodplant) in the box and transfer the caterpillars to a new box every two days. To make sure you don't harm the caterpillars, use a fine paintbrush to gently transfer the tiny caterpillars from the box into one with fresh food. 5. Move your larvae to a larger home. Once the larvae have grown bigger they will lay dormant for a few days and shed their skin, this is called ecdysis, do not mistake this for illness. On the third instar (stage in between ecdysis) use your paintbrush and move the caterpillars to a live potted plant in the large container used before. Every three days you should place another potted plant next to the old one, and the larvae will instinctively move to it. 6. Create the ideal conditions for pupation. Pupation is when the caterpillar creates a chrysalis and undergoes metamorphosis, different species do this in different ways. Instead of spinning a cocoon of forming one a branch the Privet Hawk Moth burrows into the ground to make a cocoon. When the caterpillars gain a shade of brown on their backs and loose interest in food you should transfer them to a deep bin of non-chemical topsoil. After three weeks dig them up carefully, and place them in a tin. Either store these in the fridge or another cold, frost-free environment such as your garage. In the wild they would stay underground over the winter and hibernate so you put them in a fridge to simulate winter.	.

Look, it's a melody diary! 2. If you have enough guitar experience and enough muscle memory for chord progressions without looking, close your eyes and feel the music. Visualize where it takes you. Does it take you back to a memory? A moment in your life that you loved or hated? Acknowledge these thoughts and how they make you feel, and release them through your music. 3. Reflect on your experiences. Think about who you are and the good thigs you have done for people. Question your beliefs and reality, and how you can change them. * What things can you start doing in the future to better yourself as a guitar player? * How can you make other people's lives better by playing to them? 4.

Check for correct paper size and type in your printer manual and make sure you haven't overfilled your paper feeder to avoid paper jams and may even stop a smudgy or uneven print problem. Some types of printers can struggle to print on special paper, such as glossy sheets or heavy card stock. Using a slightly smaller stack of clean, lightweight, 8 inch by 10 inch printer/copier paper will likely avoid the messy headache of jams. 2. Update or re-install your driver may fix printing errors such as strange characters and unreadable text. Go to your printer manufacturer's website (which can probably be found in your printer manual) and select the appropriate printer model and computer operating system. Follow the on-screen promps to complete installation. Bookmark and check the website regularly to make sure you don't miss an important driver update in the future! 3. Clean your printer heads to avoid blurry text and images. You can access most printer maintenance options by choosing print from any window and clicking on the properties menu located next to the name of the appropriate printer. Choose the maintenance tab and find the option to check nozzles. If the lines that print are blurred or broken, select the print head cleaner icon to clean away dried ink, dirt, and dust. Test and clean print head often to avoid build-up. 4. Replace your cartridges or toner to fix ""low ink level"" alerts, and missing/non-existent text or pictures. Each printer calls for a specific ink or toner cartridge type, so please follow the directions provided in your printer manual to properly replace your particular cartridge."

Heat the water. The first method of cooking is called ""blanching."" It is a quick way of cooking vegetables while retaining their nutritional values. This technique is especially good for green vegetables. Begin by placing the saucepan on a high heat and fill it with about with 2 litres of water. Now add salt and bring to a strong rapid boil. Use 30 grams / 1 oz of salt for every litre / 2 pt of water. The salt creates a barrier on the surface of the vegetables and also raises the temperature of the water which seals in the nutrients. 2. Blanch the asparagus. Place a bowl of iced water next to the pan in preparation for 'shocking,' the vegetables later on. Then add the asparagus into the boiling water. Allow the water to come back to the boil then prick them with a small knife to check for readiness. The asparagus should be soft but firm at the same time. Blanching the asparagus for roughly 30-60 seconds is enough for it to be perfectly cooked. 3. Remove the asparagus with your slotted spoon. Place it into the bowl of ice water, to shock the asparagus, for 30 seconds, or until cold. This will immediately stop the cooking process as well as preserve colour, and crispiness. Once removed from the ice, set them aside on the tray lined with paper towel. Keeping them in a cold place will also help to maintain colour and freshness. 4. Add the remaining vegetables. * Next add the broccoli and allow it to blanch for 60 seconds. Then test it by pricking a knife in the stalk of the floret. Remove and place it in the iced water for 30 seconds or more, until cold. Remove and place on the tray lined with paper towel. * Add the green beans. Repeat the entire blanching process, for about 60 seconds. * Finally add cauliflower and blanch for 3-5 minutes. 5. Use a steamer. The second method of steaming is by using a traditional steamer. Begin by bringing the water to a boil over a high heat. Once the water begins to boil, close the steamer to allow its internal temperature to build. 6. Add the vegetables. After the steamer has been covered for a minute, add the asparagus, the broccoli, the green beans and the cauliflower. Make sure to keep them in separate groups. This will make them easier to remove when they finish, as each one cooks at a different time. After a minute and a half, prick all the vegetables with a knife, to test them."	Place them onto a tray lined with paper, to drain a little. The cauliflower needs to steam for another 3 minutes. Remove it after this time.

Quiet and slow it down and your baby will be out in no time. 6. 6: Finally, to make them snore, keep singing your song. but sing the same one over and over. a sudden change of melody could be disorienting.

Learn how to imitate a Duchenne smile. Scientists have pinpointed more than 50 different types of smiles, and research suggests that the sincerest smile of all is the Duchenne smile – a smile that pushes up into the eyes. The reason it's more genuine is because the muscles needed to truly smile with our eyes are involuntary; they only become engaged in an authentic smile, not in a courtesy smile. That being said, you can imitate this type of smile by squinting slightly to create small pillows beneath your eyes. If you produce crow’s feet while attempting this, you are doing it properly (which is undoubtedly why heavily Botoxed faces tend to produce such fake-looking smiles). Once you master the smiling-eye technique, you will be able to use it to brighten up even very sly or faint smiles. 2. Stop being a people-pleaser. If you constantly smile in order to be polite and agreeable, you're tightly controlling your countenance and not giving your Duchenne smile much of a chance to shine through. Plus, if you're focused on everyone else's happiness, you're neglecting your own. A real smile arises from your own personal joy, not someone else's. People with martyr syndrome will often say that they derive their greatest personal joy from helping others, and sometimes this is true, but other times, it's an easy way to justify their self-sacrifice and avoid stepping out of their comfort zone. If you're the kind of person to ""forget"" about yourself, take the advice in these articles, which will help you break some of the psychological chains that can stifle a genuine smile: * How to Stop Being a People Pleaser * How to Overcome Martyr Syndrome * How to Recognize a Manipulative or Controlling Relationship 3. Be happy. A genuine smile comes from genuine happiness."	In other words, learn How to Be Optimistic and real smiles will follow. After all, think about who has the most genuine smiles: kids! They never worry because life is one big game to them. Follow their lead...be laid back and playful!

Choose a water- or oil-based wood stain from your local paint store. Oil-based stains are longer lasting and more stain resistant. They also penetrate more deeply into the wood. Water-based stains are generally quicker to apply. Bring home a few stain color swatches, and see which you prefer for your butcher block. * For the color, some people prefer a dark, walnut-color stain, while others opt for a reddish cherry-color stain, or a light, pine-colored stain. * Keep in mind that the color you choose should complement the other wood (e.g., cabinets) in your kitchen. 2. Test the stain on a small section of the butcher block. If you happen to have any leftover chunks of butcher block that aren’t attached to the counter (e.g., leftover from when it was installed), test the stain on this piece of wood. Use a fresh paintbrush to apply a single coating of stain to an out-of-the-way section of your butcher block. * Coat the test section of wood generously, as if you were staining the actual countertop. 3. Let the stain dry for 2 hours. Once it’s dry, inspect the color. If the wood has an even, consistent color and brings out the texture of the wood grain, you’re ready to stain the entire counter. * If the stain looks splotchy or has given the wood different tones, try a different brand or color of stain. 4. Paint on a layer of stain parallel to the direction of the boards. Dip your paintbrush in the can of stain, and tap it against the side to remove excess stain.	Paint in long strokes that go along with the direction of the wooden slats.

But when you receive less than stellar feedback at work, a low grade on a project or test you took at school, or when someone doesn't feel the same way about you that you do about them, it's NOT a sign that your personal worth is trash! It's simply an indicator that someTHING wasn't right for the other person, class or company. It's unrealistic to expect that you can do everything absolutely right 100% of the time. 2."

In fact, being wrong at times-such as if your first impression of someone new was less-than-stellar and it turns out to be the wrong one-is actually quite desirable.

Organize the photos and mementos. A scrapbook can contain pictures, movie tickets, programs, invitations, party favors, business cards – basically anything that will lay flat when the book is closed. 2. Decide on a theme for your scrapbook. Themes can be specific, such as a scrapbook on a travel experience, or general, such as a family scrapbook that covers a variety of experiences. Family subcategories can include birthdays, first job, Christmas, a get-together with the family, special events, a new home, graduation, a new baby, the first day of school, and weddings. 3. Choose an album. In addition to looking at patterns and designs, think about what size album to get. This should be based not only on the amount of content you have, but also the feel of the theme. A cute little book would be more thematically appropriate for a baby scrapbook than a big, hulking hardcover, for example. 4. Carefully measure and plan a template. Sketch the template on another sheet of paper and use it to keep your page layout uniform throughout the scrapbook. Though some elements should be consistent (ex. margins, border designs, and titles or captions where applicable), make sure to leave room for variables such as photo orientation, memorabilia size and shape, etc. 5. Group like items onto pages. Sort and group pictures into cohesive units, whether chronologically or thematically. Supplement them with anything that sparks a memory in your mind: concert tickets or programs, an entrance wristband, a membership card, or any souvenir can bring back vivid physical memories, helping you to dredge up additional memories and enjoy that page even more. 6. Embellish each page. Write down pivotal details about incidents depicted in the pages of your scrapbook and write them down. You can write stories, poems, phrases, or even memorable quotes to make the storytelling more vivid. Stickers, ribbons, chipboard pieces, and stamps are useful for accenting photos. 7. Add fun colors to your scrapbook, like flowers and ribbons. However too much color can make the page look over the top and therefore will turn the readers attention off the idea of the page.	.

Put the little twig of leaves in the container, and secure a lid onto it. If it does not have a lid, put a layer of paper towels on the top, and secure it with a rubber band. 8. Keep the container outside in a hidden area. Behind a bush should be nice. 9. Check on your caterpillar every day. he should get bigger and bigger every weak. 10. when the food gets old, replace it with another branch of the same plant. 11. One day you should see a chrysalis or cocoon in place of the caterpillar. The time for it to hatch should depend on the species, which you can try to research if you like. 12. When the butterfly or moth finally emerges, instead of giving it leaves, give it a variety of flowers.	You can also use humming bird food.

TRY TO GET THE BABY TO ITS MOTHER. Always first try to get the baby to its mother. Please read this article for instruction. http://www.mary.cc/squirrels/reunite.htm If the baby is hurt, cold, it's night time or mom does not come to get the baby within 2-3 hours, the baby is probably a orphan and needs you to help it. 2. PICK THE BABY UP. Get a small box about a foot square, a cat carrier, a large Tupperwaree (without the lid on) or another container. Place soft fabric at the bottom but no towels they can get their claws stuck in the loops. Put on thick leather gloves (just to be safe). Gently pick the baby up. Take this chance to observe the baby to check for injuries, bugs, bleeding, bumps or wounds. If they are bleeding or you see broken bones or serious injury, take them to a vet ASAP 3. GET THE BABY WARM. Hopefully you have a heating pad or electric blanket. Put the heating pad or blanket on low to medium temperature depending upon type. Place the container on top of half of the pad. This way if it gets too hot, they can simply crawl off the pad. Baby squirrels should be about 99 degrees F. They can't warm their own heat when they are babies so they need heat make sure that you check to make sure the container or squirrels don't get too hot. Also check to make sure they're warm. Some heating pads have automatic safety shut offs after so a few hours. Place a towel over top of the container to keep the heat inside. If it's a summer day, they might not need the towel on top. If you don't have a heating pad or blanket, you can use a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel. Don't let their skin touch the bottle or they can be burned. You can also use a exam glove filled with water, knotted and microwaved for about 30 seconds depending upon your ovens watts. 4. LOOK FOR A SQUIRREL REHABILITATION CENTER. Call your local vets, animal shelters, humane societies, Fish & Game, Fish & Wildlife, Wildlife groups to get a referral for a local wildlife rehabilitator that takes in squirrels. Try these links for local rehabilitators http://www.tc.umn.edu/~devo0028/contact.htm http://www.wildlifecare.org/list.html You can also search online http://www.google.com Put in ""squirrel rehabilitation"" and your state and city. If no one answers the phone, returns your call or gives you further instructions, it's time to do a bit more. 5. GET THE BABY HYDRATED. Most fallen babies will be in need of water. You can see how unhydrated they are by gently pinching their skin. If the ""tent"" of their skin stays there over a second or more, they are dehydrated. If they look wrinkly, have sunken eyes, appear emaciated, they are dehydrated. Most super markets and drug stores carry Pedialyte in the baby section or their own brand of rehydrating baby fluid. Gerber has a brand also. Squirrels like fruit flavors but plain will do if it's all they've got. If you can't find Pedialyte, there is always Gatorade. If you are nowhere near a store or drug store here is a homemade formula. * One teaspoon salt * three teaspoons of sugar mixed into one quart of warm water We use oral syringes, i.e. syringes with no needles, but you can use a clean eye dropper or an oral baby syringe. They also sell syringe feeders at Petco and Petsmart right next to the Esbilac puppy milk. Make sure the baby is warm before you give it any fluids or it won't be able to digest the fluids.If they are tiny hairless pink babies about 2-3 inches long, you must be very careful when giving them fluids. It's easy to aspirate the babies and get the fluid in their lungs. This will give them pneumonia and they might die. Just put one little drop on their lips at a time and let them suck that in. If they their eyes are open, you can let them take the syringe in their mouth and gently give them a few drops. If a lot falls out of their mouth or comes out the nose, you're going way too fast. If you get some coming out their nose, hold them upside down instantly for 10 seconds then blot the fluids off their nose, out of their nostrils. Wait a about minute before you continue. Make sure you give these fluids warm but not hot. Store unused amounts in the refrigerator.If they won't take the fluids, put a drop on their lips or poke a drop in their mouth so they can taste some of it first. Some will just open their mouths wide and start sucking away. I would give tiny eyes closed pink babies 1 cc every two hours, fully furred eyes closed babies 1-2 cc about every two hours, open eyed babies 2-4 cc every three hours until a rehabber calls you back with your instructions. (1 cc is about 20-25 drops from an eye dropper,5 cc is 1 tsp) 6. Baby squirrels need to be stimulated to poo and pee when their eyes are closed. After each feeding of fluids you will need to gently wipe the genital and anal area with a warm moist cotton ball or Q-tip until they pee or poo. If they are very dehydrated and haven't eaten in a while, they may not pee for a quite a few feedings and may not poo for a day."	.

Consider past exposure to trauma. CPTSD is caused by repeated or prolonged traumatic experiences, which the person could not escape from. A person may have been exposed to a traumatic environment for months, years, or decades. Examples include, but are not limited to: * Child abuse or neglect * Prolonged bullying * Stalking victimization * Crises such as kidnapping or sex trafficking * Domestic abuse * Extreme violence such as military conflict, torture, or genocide campaigns * Brainwashing * Other types of mistreatment 2. Notice changes in feelings and impulses. Someone with CPTSD may face strong emotions, particularly upsetting ones, in a number of ways. Their moods and behavior may be extreme, or very inhibited. * Anger difficulties: Someone with CPTSD may have extremely inhibited anger, or explosive anger. They may alternate between the two. * Depression: The person may show signs of persistent sadness, self hatred, and even suicidal thoughts. * Anxiety: The person may be hypervigilant and perfectionistic. They may experience panic attacks. * Blame: The person may blame themselves for what happened, fantasize about revenge upon the perpetrator(s), or obsess over blame instead of trying to fix a situation. * Sexuality: The person may act impulsively in sexual situations, or have an extremely inhibited sexuality. (This is distinct from asexuality, which is a healthy and non-trauma-related sexual orientation.) 3. Look for issues with attention and consciousness. The person may forget or relive traumatic experience, and they may detach themselves from the world. * Forgetting experiences: The person might forget their traumatic experiences, and only remember them later. * Reliving experiences: The person may experience ""emotional flashbacks,"" during which they re-live the intense feelings of a traumatic experience, either due to rumination or an outside trigger. Or they may experience PTSD flashbacks. * Dissociation: The person may mentally detach themselves from the world. 4. Look for self-perception problems. CPTSD integrates itself into a person's sense of self, changing how the person feels about themselves, often in deeply negative ways. * Self blame: The person may feel shame, guilt, and self hatred. They may assume what happened was their fault. * Feelings of powerlessness: They may feel helpless. * Feeling different: The person may feel different from everyone else, and have trouble connecting to other people. 5. Look at the person's relationships. People with CPTSD often have trouble building and maintaining close relationships, because they've lost trust that other people are safe to be around. The person may trust a select few people, or no one at all, preferring to keep their distance to avoid getting hurt. * Isolation: The person may withdraw from human contact, feeling safer when they're alone. * Distrust: The person might struggle to form trusting relationships, feeling that anyone could turn on them at any time. They may even become hostile. * Search for a rescuer: The person might wish that someone would swoop in to save them. * Difficulty with close relationships: The person may have few or no close relationships, and these relationships could be disrupted by lack of trust. 6. Consider their feelings towards the perpetrator(s). People with CPTSD often have strong feelings toward the person who hurt them, and these feelings can change dramatically over time (such as hating the person one day and loving them the next). Thus, the relationship can be extremely complicated. * Seeing the perpetrator as all-powerful * Obsessing over their relationship with the perpetrator * Feeling that they have a special relationship with the perpetrator * Idealizing or trying to appease the perpetrator * Accepting the perpetrator's belief system and rationalizations 7. Notice ""somatization,"" or physical illnesses brought on by stress. Look for physical symptoms that can't be explained by some other condition. Someone with CPTSD may have symptoms like: * Migraines * Muscle aches and pains * TMJ * Stomachaches * Chronic pain 8. Consider how the person sees the world. CPTSD can impact how someone perceives the world around them. Due to bad experiences, they may start expecting cruelty or even abuse from the people around them. * Believing that the world is a cruel place * Loss of hope or faith 9. Recognize that a person with CPTSD may not display every single possible symptom. If someone has most, but not all, of the symptoms, then it is still worth seeing a medical professional, and CPTSD is likely. 10. Avoid dismissing a real problem. Trauma survivors often belittle what they have been through, and this includes people with CPTSD. Don't dismiss a problem because it sounds less severe than what some other people have been through. If CPTSD describes your experience, and helps you understand your symptoms and how to heal, then don't ignore it. You can still have CPTSD... *"	.

Look at the person's relationships. People with CPTSD often have trouble building and maintaining close relationships, because they've lost trust that other people are safe to be around. The person may trust a select few people, or no one at all, preferring to keep their distance to avoid getting hurt. * Isolation: The person may withdraw from human contact, feeling safer when they're alone. * Distrust: The person might struggle to form trusting relationships, feeling that anyone could turn on them at any time. They may even become hostile. * Search for a rescuer: The person might wish that someone would swoop in to save them. * Difficulty with close relationships: The person may have few or no close relationships, and these relationships could be disrupted by lack of trust. 6. Consider their feelings towards the perpetrator(s). People with CPTSD often have strong feelings toward the person who hurt them, and these feelings can change dramatically over time (such as hating the person one day and loving them the next). Thus, the relationship can be extremely complicated. * Seeing the perpetrator as all-powerful * Obsessing over their relationship with the perpetrator * Feeling that they have a special relationship with the perpetrator * Idealizing or trying to appease the perpetrator * Accepting the perpetrator's belief system and rationalizations 7. Notice ""somatization,"" or physical illnesses brought on by stress. Look for physical symptoms that can't be explained by some other condition. Someone with CPTSD may have symptoms like: * Migraines * Muscle aches and pains * TMJ * Stomachaches * Chronic pain 8. Consider how the person sees the world. CPTSD can impact how someone perceives the world around them. Due to bad experiences, they may start expecting cruelty or even abuse from the people around them. * Believing that the world is a cruel place * Loss of hope or faith 9. Recognize that a person with CPTSD may not display every single possible symptom. If someone has most, but not all, of the symptoms, then it is still worth seeing a medical professional, and CPTSD is likely. 10. Avoid dismissing a real problem. Trauma survivors often belittle what they have been through, and this includes people with CPTSD. Don't dismiss a problem because it sounds less severe than what some other people have been through. If CPTSD describes your experience, and helps you understand your symptoms and how to heal, then don't ignore it. You can still have CPTSD... * Even if there was no physical violence * Even if the perpetrator was perfectly nice sometimes, or even most of the time * Even if you're not sure it was abuse * Even if other people experienced similar bad situations and weren't traumatized (Some people are more vulnerable to trauma than others.) * Even if the perpetrator really does love you *"	.

Make sure you have all of your materials present (see ""Things You'll Need"" below), especially the glass of water (you'll probably need it)! 2. While standing in front of the mirror, open your mouth and shine the light into your mouth. 3. Close off, or flex your throat muscles while sticking out your tongue. Basically, go ""Ahh,"" only tighten until you are holding your breath, sort of as if you were gargling water. This should push your tonsils forward so you can see them better. 4. Very gently use the looped end of your extra-long bobby-pin to scoop out any tonsil stones you can easily see at the opening of your tonsil ""craters."" (They can sometimes be hard to get out because of the sticker-than-normal saliva that can form soon after you start sticking things into the back of your throat, but keep trying until you catch it in the loop of your bobby-pin, or scoot it to the front of your mouth.) 5. As the super sticky saliva starts forming, take a few drinks of water to get rid of it. This saliva will form very quickly after you gag or cough, and will still form slightly more slowly even if you don't. It is very important to clear out this sticky saliva before you start extracting another tonsil stone, because it will cause more difficulties in getting them out. Once they are out, place them on the paper towel by gently dragging the bobby-pin across the towel, or using a toothpick or another bobby-pin to push them onto the towel. 6. After you have extracted all the stones you can see, place your thumb into your neck under your jaw, and your index finger into your mouth right beside your tonsil and gently try to squeeze any remaining stones to the openings (like squeezing out toothpaste). If no stones appear, don't assume they aren't there. Some ""craters"" are very deep and it is sometimes hard to get them all. 7. If your throat can still tolerate more, very carefully insert the loop of the bobby-pin down into the crater until you hit the bottom of it. Do not shove the bobby-pin into the crater. It is sometimes difficult to realize or feel when you have hit the bottom of the crater. Normally, the loop will not go any deeper without you feeling pain when you have hit the bottom."	One attempt should sweep most of them out depending on how wide your craters are, but make sure you don't scrape your tonsils. That can hurt.

Execute some simple software fixes. 1. Don't spend money on defragmentation software. The built-in Windows defragmenter works just fine. * Although it is entirely optional, you can search online for freeware defragmenting software that adds additional optimization tweaks. 2. Ensure that Windows XP is utilizing the NTFS file system. Most modern hard drives run NTFS, so this isn't too important. You can check by doing the following: 1. Double click My Computer on the Desktop. 2. Right click on the C: drive. 3. Select Properties. 4. Examine the File System type. If it says NTFS, then skip to the next step. If you are running a FAT32 file system, it is strongly recommended that you convert to a NTFS. Note that FAT32 drives are most prominent on smaller and older-generation hard drives. 3. Disable file indexing. Windows XP's indexing service extracts information from documents and other files on the hard drive and creates a ""searchable keyword index"", which is used to make searching for files more efficient. This sounds ideal but, as you can imagine, this process is quite taxing on any system. The idea is that the user can search for a word, phrase, or property inside a document, should they have hundreds or thousands of documents and not know the file name of the document they want. Windows XP's built-in search functionality can still perform these kinds of searches without the Indexing service. It just takes longer. The OS has to open each file at the time of the request to help find what the user is looking for. Most people never need this feature of search. Those who do are typically in a large corporate environment where thousands of documents are located on at least one server. But if you're a typical system builder, most of your clients are small and medium businesses. And if your clients have no need for this search feature, I recommend disabling it. Here's how: First, double-click the My Computer icon. Next, right-click on the C: Drive, then select Properties. Uncheck ""Allow Indexing Service to index this disk for fast file searching."" Next, apply changes to ""C: subfolders and files,"" and click OK. If a warning or error message appears (such as ""Access is denied""), click the Ignore All button. 4. Empty the Windows Prefetch folder every three months or so. Windows XP can ""prefetch"" portions of data and applications that are used frequently. This makes processes appear to load faster when called upon by the user. That's fine. But over time, the prefetch folder may become overloaded with references to files and applications no longer in use. When that happens, Windows XP is wasting time, and slowing system performance, by pre-loading them. Nothing critical is in this folder, and the entire contents are safe to delete. 5. Update the PC's video and motherboard chipset drivers."	For more information on how to configure your BIOS properly, see this article on my site.

Smile: You want your audience to warm to you and know that you enjoy what you are doing; every single performance you do is another thing that people will notice you for, and you may even be given more parts in the future 2. Most people go through a stage a couple of days before their performance when they start to doubt themselves and get themselves down about it. If you decide you do not want to do the performance anymore, you can always back out, no one is going to make you do anything if you don't want to. You are your own worst critic, so everything that you think sounds bad most people probably won't notice. If you want to, perform in front of your friends and family and get their advice. It always helps to find out what the audience think. 3. Do not record yourself singing if you are going through the 'doubting yourself' phase as no-one likes listening to themselves singing, it will sound different in your ears than in everyone else's. Also, if you are going to record yourself anyway, make sure you do it on a good quality sound device because you are definetly not going to sound your best if the recording sound isn't good! Even a lot of famous singers do not like listening to themselves sing. 4. Make sure you know the song you are meant to be singing off by heart. Listen to the song whenever possible, so it gets stuck in your head. When choosing a song to sing, make sure you actaully like the song, so you can make a connection with it and really pour your heart out in to it. Getting sick of the song after practicing it is not nice for the performer. 5. Warm up before you sing your song, but make sure you don't strain your voice. Drink a reasonable amount of water before the performance and if you are fighting off a nasty cold you can always find some good articles about 'How to sing through a cold.' 6.	Go out their and sing your heart out. Just remember, as long as you like it, it doesn't matter what other people think. You can't possibly impress everyone. Who cares what they think, its your performance, your time to shine!

Shop_for_a_Wedding_Dress.txt	Begin_Revision	0.943	## Steps	994	But you do n't need a $ 5,000 dress to feel like royalty on your special day .	## Tips	1066	You do n't need a $ 5,000 dress to feel like royalty on your special day .	<delete><But><1>|||<replace><you><2><You><1>	True	Steps  1. Decide when to shop.There's no time too early to start looking, but there is a time that's too late. Depending on where you get your dress, it could take several months for your dress to be ordered and shipped. From then, you'll need several weeks for your seamstress to make alterations. So never start looking for a dress two months before the wedding day! You should start shopping about 9 months before your wedding, but preferably sooner. You want time to really look around and decide.If your wedding is two years away but you can't wait to start looking, go ahead and start! There's nothing wrong with beginning early, even a year before you'll actually place an order. But don't make the mistake of buying yet. Wedding dresses are constantly being updated, and people are constantly changing. The last thing you want is to buy what you think is your dream dress two summers before your wedding, and find out the following summer that your real dream dress has just been created. Try not to make your final decision until you have to make a decision. 2. Decide where to shop.This will probably be a decision based on your budget. Decide whether you'll shop at chains, small boutiques, etc. Decide how far you'll travel to see dresses in person. If you want an expensive designer dress, you may have to travel to New York City to actually try it on. However, if you've chosen to include places like David's Bridal, you're sure to find one nearby. In bigger cities you'll have access to a number of shops and boutiques, which will carry gowns from a number of designers, but they'll probably be more on the expensive side. * Beware of shopping online! Getting the dress sized correctly is very important, and this is best done by actually trying it on. If you're not careful you could seriously regret your decision. However, there are some very reputable online stores that sell wedding gowns with personalized service, as well as other items for the bride. If you decide to shop online, do so with great care. * Many places don't require an appointment, but you should make one anyway. This is to ensure you don't wait around for an hour while while the consultant help customers who did have appointments. People with appointments will always come first. When you make an appointment, you'll be registered with the store, and they'll ask you basic questions about your wedding day. * Some people claim to have had bad experiences with chain stores, such as encountering sales consultants who are unfriendly or not helpful. It's hit or miss. The good news is, those stores will always have another location somewhere nearby, and you can always go to the other one. If you get a consultant who isn't nice to you and you don't want to check out the other location, just ask for a different consultant. If you're too embarrassed to do so, just leave and report her to the manager anonymously. No sales consultant has the right to be unkind to a bride! * Some shops will not let you browse freely through the gowns. They'll ask you for a description of what you're looking for and then bring you gowns they think match it. If you really hate the idea of not being able to see everything yourself, avoid these places. Call and ask first if it's important to you. * Large warehouse type stores are excellent places to find gowns. They have dresses for every budget, and will usually let you browse through the gowns as long as you want and try on as many as you want. * If you have a very large budget, you may be able to look at well-known designers, such as Reem Acra or Amsale.	Contrary to what some people may believe, chains like David's Bridal have gowns of excellent quality, and they have lines from their own designers, such as Oleg Cassini, who create many beautiful, very well-made dresses that can't be distinguished from gowns that are thousands of dollars higher in price.

Thus, you'll certainly succeed growing marijuana when you use hydroponics. 2. Today, hydroponics is an established branch of agronomy. Progress has been rapid, and results obtained in different nations have proved it to be thoroughly practical and to have very definite advantages compared to traditional methods of horticulture. The two chief merits of the soil-less cultivation of plants are, first, much higher crop yields, and second, hydroponics can be used in areas where in-ground agriculture or gardening is not possible. 3. A section of a basement makes a perfect grow room. An attic will work but heat can be a real issue unless very well ventilated. All grow rooms need fresh air (from another room or outdoors) to replace carbon dioxide that the plants breathe when the grow light(s) are on. An exhaust fan is also needed so hot air will be fanned out of the room. 4.	You can use a hydroponic garden to grow just about any kind of plant. The experience you get from hydroponic growing can be applied to any other hydroponic crop you decide to grow in the long run. Thus, anytime you want to grow a particular type of crop, consider hydroponic growing.

If the animal is wild or doesn't trust humans, try and crouch down, making yourself look smaller. 2. Remember to move very slowly, and if you are trying to pet it, let the animal look at your hand and maybe sniff it a little. Do not move your hand while the animal is sniffing you, of it might get scared. 3. If the animal has finished sniffing you or doesn't look scared of it, very slowly try to pet the animal. This might not work, but the one key to making it more successful is to avoid going fast. 4. At this point, you should try to pet the animal a bit more and talk to it very softly so it knows what you sound like. 5. If the animal keeps coming around your house or a certain place, treat it like this the first couple times you see it, at least until it is even less scared of you or will even walk towards you a little.	.

Check local hardware stores, garden supply shops, and home-supply stores. Snake-proof fencing should be solid or have mesh gaps no larger than and should be at least tall. * Snake-proof fencing isn’t cheap. A single roll can cost about $60 USD. 2. Choose an area of your backyard you’d like to cordon off from snakes. Due to the cost of the snake-proof fencing, you may not be able to fence off an entire large backyard. Instead, choose a specific zone you’d like to keep snake-free. * This could be a children’s play area, the patch of grass where you walk your pet, or the section of yard nearest your back door. 3. Install the fencing deep so snakes can’t crawl under it. If there are any gaps between the bottom of your fence and the ground, rattlers will crawl right in. To prevent gaps, use a shovel to dig a narrow trench deep, and lay out the fencing in the trench.	.

Sterling silver earrings put the final touch at an intimate evening for your partner. 3. If you have decided to purchase silver jewelry then be sure of a few things like Quality and guarantee. 4. Like other industries, there are so many quality controls in jewelry and this is not an exception. During the quality control process the silver will be refined to maintain the U.S. law, and it’s called “Sterling Silver”. 5. Many jewelry makers and vendors extensively make jewelry with colored CZs, colored glasses and gems like – blue topaz, amethyst, turquoise, moonstone, amber black onyx and so may…. 6. Most of the jewelry items come with a quality guarantee, i.e. guarantee for manufacturing defects. Defective jewelry may be returned with proper authorization, fixed exchange date and the exchange rate of credit. 7. Before you make an investment on silver jewelry, be careful especially for fake jewelry because cheap imitation of silver jewelry is looking very similar to the original. 8.

Understanding farts. Gas, also called flatus or flatulence, is air in the intestine that is passed through the rectum with or without a sound or a smell. Air that is passed from the digestive tract through the mouth is called belching. Air that is passed from the digestive tract through the backside (anus) is called farting. Gas can make you feel bloated, which may cause cramps or colicky abdominal pain. Gas, or flatus, is produced when naturally occurring bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract begin to break down, or digest, food. When an excess of air builds up in the tract from any number of causes, it is released as gas. Gastrointestinal gases include methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen. 2. Physically suppressing gas. The ability to suppress gas will require practice to perfect. And, on occasion, even the best suppresser will have a few accidental, audible farts. However, it is still risky. Even if you are able to pass it without sound, it may or may not be accompanied by a smell. 3. To physically suppress the gas once you feel the indication to “pass gas,” lean back, straighten your back, and tighten your abdominal, backside, lower back and thigh muscles. Try to relax the remainder of your muscles for a moment. Now try rocking very slowly back and forth in a very small amount of space just using your muscles from the waist down. The gas will continue to build for a few minutes.	At this time, re-engage the muscles at the beginning of these instructions. Soon, you should feel the pressure subside. At this time you can SLOWLY release the tension in the engaged muscles. If there is an odor, re-engage the muscles and try to excuse yourself to the bathroom to take care of the situation. But, be careful, a change in body position can release the gas if you are not consistently engaging the muscles. If there is not odor, continue releasing the muscles in small stages to relieve the pressure. This process requires practice and experimentation.

Do not scrub. * Brush your teeth for two to three minutes. Once you finish, rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash. 2. Floss your teeth to remove any additional food. Flossing your teeth regularly and thoroughly is a great way to ensure that your teeth remain free of cavities and decay. * Dispense around of floss from the dispenser. * Wind it around the middle fingers of each hand, keeping a 1-inch section open for flossing. * Floss the upper teeth first, then the lower teeth. * Hold the floss tightly between the thumb and forefinger and gently guide it between your teeth in a rubbing-sliding motion. * Never use force, as it can damage the gum tissue. * Once it reaches the gum line, make a ""C"" shape around one tooth and then manipulate it in the space between the tooth and gum. * Gently rub the side of the tooth, moving the floss in an up and down motion, away from the gums. * Keep using a fresh section of floss as you move from tooth to tooth. *"	.

You should always wear a helmet. A good riding school will provide various helmets. Ask someone to help you choose one to fit your head. Ideally, it should fit as snugly as possible without being uncomfortable. Make sure it covers your forehead!You need to wear the helmet because if anything happened, your head would be protected and so should your neck. 2. Before you head off to ride, your instructor may tell you things that seem unimportant or obvious. Pay attention, because a good instructor will usually try not to overload you with information, especially not before your first lesson! If your instructor says nothing, probe him/her for information about the area you will be riding in, what to do if your horse spooks, etc. * Your instructor will probably have the horse groomed and tacked up for your first time. You will probably learn how to lead the horse to the mounting block. However, you can observe them grooming the horse and try to pick up some tips. Usually you will use a curry comb first, then a hard brush, and finally a soft brush. You will also need to learn how to pick out the horse's hooves.	It is easier to ride a horse if you know who he is: what he is scared of, what he enjoys, and how is the best way to bond with him.

Decide if window fan ventilation is an appropriate home cooling option for you. This is the best application for home cooling where it is hot during the day and cool at night. The object is to cool the house during the night, using outside air, to delay or even eliminate turning on the air conditioner during the day. At the end of the day, the object is to turn off A/C earlier and cool the house with outside air, instead. Beware that window fans won't allow you to control the indoor temp as closely as A/C, so be prepared to accept a 20 degree temp range from day to night inside, if using this method. If the temperature is uncomfortably hot, humid, and/or polluted outside, even at night, then this method isn't appropriate for you. Also, window fan ventilation is not recommended for those without adequate window screens, as insects or animals may enter through the open windows. Gnats and other small insects often get in right through window screens, so be prepared to accept that, or don't use this method. In high crime areas windows accessible from the outside are also likely to be used as a means of entrance by criminals.	In this case, be sure to turn the fans off when everyone leaves the room, since fans produce heat without any corresponding cooling effect when nobody is in the room to benefit from the increased air circulation.

Gnats and other small insects often get in right through window screens, so be prepared to accept that, or don't use this method. In high crime areas windows accessible from the outside are also likely to be used as a means of entrance by criminals.

Many also provide the ability to reverse the fan direction without turning the fan around. Box fans may also be used in windows, and are often more powerful and easier to remove. * Extension cords rated at or above the wattage of the fans you are using. * Inside and outside thermometers. * Optionally, electrical outlet timers to turn fans on and off automatically at preset times. Ensure that these timers are rated at or above the fan wattage. Note that using electrical timers requires leaving fans in the windows all day long, which decreases cooling efficiency.	.

Prepare for a conversation. If you suspect your daughter may be pregnant, you should confront her. The only way to know for sure is to have your teen take a pregnancy test and see a doctor. Spend some time preparing to ask your teen about her potential pregnancy. How and when you have the conversation can make a huge different in whether your teen will be willing to open up to you. * Write down your feelings. With any emotional or difficult conversation, you want to make sure you think out what you want to express beforehand. You don't need to be reading off a script when you talk to your teen. However, you should have some idea of what to say and how to say it ahead of time. Spend a few minutes jotting down your thoughts and feelings prior to the conversation. * Try to go into the conversation with empathy. If you could from a place of scorn or judgement, your teen will be unwilling to open up to you. Therefore, try to put yourself in your teen's shoes. Remember what you were like as a teenager. Try to understand how your teenage experience was both similar and different to your daughter's experiences. You likely remember the pressure and excitement of being a teen. Was there anything different about your daughter's experience? Have there been any specific pressures put on her that might have contributed to her becoming pregnant? * Go into the conversation without expectations. Do not confront your daughter expecting her to be immediately open to your help. However, don't go in expecting an argument either. If you rev yourself up for a particular outcome, it can be hard to recalibrate if something different occurs. You do not know how your teen will react when you ask her about a potential pregnancy. Therefore, do not try to guess. Go into the conversation as prepared as possible with no particular expectations. 2. Ask without judgement. Remember, you want to show your teen respect. Even if you're upset with the situation, coming from a place of judgement will only serve to alienate your teen. In the event your teen is pregnant, you want her to feel she can see you as a source of help and guidance throughout her pregnancy. * To start, do not assume anything. Go into the conversation assuming your teen had a good reason for making the decisions she made. Even if it does not seem like a good reason in your eyes, your teen probably saw it that way at the time. Do not pre-judge the situation or your teen's behavior. Even if you feel her becoming pregnant was reckless, try your best to leave this judgement behind. It will not help the situation in the present moment. * Never assume you know what's wrong. Even if your teen is displaying signs of pregnancy, you cannot know for sure without confirmation. Therefore, do not enter the conversation with something like, ""I know you're pregnant"" or ""It seems like you're pregnant."" Instead, ask. Say something like, ""I'm concerned about some of your behavior. Do you think you might be pregnant?"" 3. Try to understand rather than advise first. Teenagers are still very much children but are also old enough to crave some autonomy. Advice during a stressful time like pregnancy may not be taken well. Therefore, try your best to understand your daughter's feelings, actions, wants, and needs before offering any guidance. * Listen to what your teen tells you. Try to withhold judgement as she explains how she became pregnant. Ask nonjudgmental questions for clarification when necessary. Ask if she's made any decisions while reminding her she's very young and it's okay to take some time to make a decision about her pregnancy. * It can help to practice active listening. This is a way of listening that promotes understand and can be useful during difficult conversations. Give your daughter non-verbal cues, like nodding on occasion, to show you are listening. Briefly paraphrase her words back to her when she finishes talking to show you heard what is said. If you have any questions about what's being said, wait until she's finished her sentence to ask. 4. Help your daughter think for herself. Remember, guidance is better than outright advice. Pregnancy is extremely difficult for a teen so you want to make sure your daughter makes her own decisions. However, you want to make sure your teen is able to think for herself in this situation."	.

Start mentioning the idea of moving out when you haven't even touched 18.(Roughly a few months to a year before). Make sure to find the right time to tell them as well, you don't want to tell them when they are in a bad mood. If you do so, your parents will know that you want it badly, and they will have time to consider their decision (whether it be 'yes' or 'no'). Chances are, you don't want to let them know the day before, as they will likely disprove of the decision as it seems very rash. Start talking about what you want to do with your life, at the dinner table is probably the ideal place for conversation with your parents, and talk about your future. Simple stuff. However, never blurt it out. Construct your ideas and then analyze that is it possible to keep your thoughts out without any rejections. 2. Make sure you figure out a way to support yourself. In life, all parents wish that their children are well stabled in their life. If your parents are the type of people who absolutely do not want you moving out of the house at 18, saying that you need to have a stable job to support yourself in order to live separately. Take that moment as an opportunity to prove yourself rather then fearing of failure. 3. See if you can find a roommate. Sometimes, the only reason parents don't like their children living on their own at 18 is because the world isn't exactly the safest place. They might feel more at ease with the idea of you moving in with a friend. Make your roommate feel comfortable with your parents.	In that case, you need to make sure that your roommate is not a harm for you. They should be supportive, helpful, and someone you get along with. He or she must be first trusted by your parents and you.

Understand the properties of apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is a product filled with minerals and essential vitamins, including magnesium, potassium and iron; many humans make use of its properties daily to improve digestion, baking, cleaning, and general health. The best apple cider vinegar is that which is fermented and unfiltered because it has ""the mother"" (a stringy substance) which contains the most enzymes and minerals. 2. Don't be concerned about how your dog will see apple cider vinegar. Sure, there is an odor but you won't be spooning this down the dog's throat; the remedies suggested here are all suitable for adding to food or water. 3. Keep your dog healthy with apple cider vinegar. Regular use of apple cider vinegar in your dog's diet can help prevent skin rashes, skin irritation, tooth decay, infections, and tear stains. The best way to give apple cider vinegar is to dilute it well in water or food and to ensure that it is only given when your dog has eaten already (to avoid a potential for upset). A teaspoon added to water or food 2–3 times a week should suffice as a preventative measure. 4. Use apple cider vinegar to aid your dog's digestion. You don't need to rush to the vet's for expensive dog digestive products."	This will increase your dog's appetite, as well as balancing the pH levels of the dog's body. Apple cider vinegar will help improve diarrhea episodes and can fix constipation in a dog with repeated use.

Rest and eat up. In the days leading up to your competition, you want to be well rested and eat food that will give you the energy and concentration to perform well. Try to get eight hours of sleep in the days before a competition, and don’t skip breakfast the morning of the big day. What you eat specifically varies depending on the competition, but you’ll generally want to raise your blood sugar and focus on carbohydrates to maximize your energy. 2. Arrive early. Arriving early offers plenty of benefits, in addition to the obvious one of not missing your competition. An early arrival also allows you to scout out the location of the event, as well as your competitors. You won’t feel rushed or stressed either, as you’ll have time to prepare. 3. Avoid distractions. Try not to chit-chat too much immediately before your competition. Find some space to yourself to clear your mind of everything except the task at hand. For example, you might find a corner to listen to music with your headphones. 4. Revisit your visualizations. Remember the visualizations you did as you prepared? Before the competition, do one last visualization of what you’re about to do. The competition is now your primary focus. 5. Concentrate on execution. Don’t linger over mistakes during the competition.	This is difficult not necessarily easy, but it is important to staying focused on the competition and everything you’ve practiced. So focus entirely on the task at hand, and if your mind wanders, don’t worry about that either. Refocus and keep going.

Consider peppermint tea instead of peppermint oil. Peppermint teas is not only refreshing, it can help reduce some mild symptoms of indigestion. For instance, if you are experiencing gastrointestinal discomfort, peppermint tea may help. Get peppermint tea from your local grocery store or health food store or make your own. * To make your own, use 1-2 teaspoons of dried, ground peppermint leaves per cup of water. Boil the water first, then add the leaves once the water settles and let sit for 10-15 minutes. * Peppermint tea will lose effectiveness in treating upset stomach if used habitually. Only use it when you have discomfort in the mid or upper portion of your belly. 2. Do not take essential oils regularly. Stated simply, essential oils can be toxic to the liver or kidneys if taken in unsafe quantities. Similarly, natural processes within your body may change the effect of the essential oils, and the oils may also interact negatively with medications, either suddenly or after extended use. 3. Be aware of risks specific to peppermint oil. Taking peppermint oil in particular poses some risks to certain demographics.	Do not take it if you’re experiencing intense constipation, have passed blood in recent stools, or are experiencing irregular vaginal bleeding. Additional factors that may put you at risk include:

Grip the ball between your thumb and middle finger. Place your middle finger along the bottom seam of the baseball and your thumb along the back seam. Leave your index finger off the ball. Instead of using it to grip the ball, you'll be using it to point at where you want the ball to go. * Hold the baseball such that the curves of the seams are close to your palm, with one on top and one on the bottom of your palm. * For right-handed people, place your middle finger on the right seam on top, and your thumb on the left seam on bottom. Lefties should do the opposite. 2. Keep your grip hidden. If the hitter knows you're about to throw a curveball, he'll be prepared for the change in speed and drop. It's important to hide your pitch until you wind up to throw it. Make sure your glove is covering your hand gripping the ball, so no one on the other team will be able to see that you're gripping for a curveball. *	Practice hiding your grip so your curveballs are harder to read.

You can also try doing this on a sunny day by shutting all the doors, covering the windows with the lights off to see if any light shines through cracks. 6. Check the roof of the barn and replace any frayed shingles that may look like they are damaged. The weather during winter will just increase the problem later on which you don't want. 7. If you have the money, it would be best to insulate the attic of the barn. Tight on money? Use whatever you can find and be creative. However, try to not use something the livestock won't mind munching on. Here are some good cheap insulation suggestions: * Bails of straw * Old carpet * Lining for weed control * Blankets * Corn stalks 8. If you have plumbing in the barn, use proper pipe insulation and heat tape to prevent them from freezing over and possibly bursting. 9. The livestock needs ventilation. Place thick plastic on the outside of most of the windows. It's also important that the animals get fresh air as well. Warm, but not airtight should suffice.	.

Learn your limits. Ask whoever is in charge of the graduation to tell you about how much time you have, and if there's anything you need to keep in mind (does your school allow religious sentiments in the speech, are there topics the speeches are expected to keep in mind, etc). It's a lot easier to write with this in mind than it is to re-write later. 2. Pick your basic topic. Is there something that you'd like to say to your class? To your teachers and parents? Is there something important to you that's also of interest to your classmates and people in the audience? This would be the broad, general topic--diversity, or ambition, or the importance of Latin and Ancient Greek in everyday life, if that's what floats your boat. Whatever it is, it should be something you're genuinely interested in, not something that you feel you're supposed to be interested in. 3. Open strong and light. Yes, your friends and family want to hear you, and will be glad to listen, but you also want to keep them interested, as well as the strangers who are there to see people you don't know get their diplomas. The opening is where you catch people. You want to make sure it gets their attention. You're the first of the main events at graduation. A whispered, ""I want to talk to you today about the importance of feeding the hungry"" isn't going to do. In fact, avoid ""I want to talk about..."" openings entirely, unless you're going to make a joke about it. And by the way, a joke isn't a bad way to start, as long as it's in good taste and related to what you mean to say. The most common strong opening is an anecdote, preferably a slightly humorous, or at least light, one. Even if you want to talk about something heavy as you go, open up with something that people can relate to, and will make them smile. For example, if you want to talk about the importance of intervention in tragic events in the world, open with a personal story about the time your cat got stuck behind the dryer when you were six, and everyone seemed to be too busy to help, until your beloved older brother finally gave you a hand. (If your friends are in these stories, ask them first if they're okay with it.) Pick something that you'll be able to pick up on again at the end, to tie the speech together."	.

Understand the difference between a feral cat which may or may not bite and a semi-feral cat. A feral cat is one that has had little or no contact with people, and that has lived all or most of its life in the wild. A semi-feral cat has had some contact with people, enough that it may approach them for food or even allow itself to be touched. 2. Be cautious and be safe. Do not attempt to ""tame"" a truly wild cat. * If they are adults or nearly adults, and are truly feral, that means that they cannot be tamed'. That is basically what ""feral"" is. Wild. Genuinely so, as much or almost as much as if they had been born skunks or rats instead of cats. A stray who was already tamed as a kitten, that's a different matter. You can sometimes tame a stray who has not had very much recent contact with humans. You cannot"" tame an adult cat who has never or very seldom been handled as a kitten. * You also cannot always tell at a glance which cat is merely a stray, not actually wild, and which cat is truly feral. They do act different around people, there are some signs, such as the stray or the semi-feral may come up to you and almost want to be petted but then back off, or may even let you pet them briefly. The true feral is NOT going to do that, and WILL (not might, but almost certainly will) bite or scratch if you do manage to catch one and to briefly hold onto one. The wild animal's instinct is to bite you VERY hard to make you let go. * You cannot tame a wild adult cat, but you may be able to briefly catch one and get seriously injured in the process, so be VERY careful around any unfamiliar cats you may happen to meet, just in case. The best thing to do is to gently, slowly allow them to come to you. 3. & If they completely refuse to ever come near a human at all, not even to get food or water, then they are probably wild or almost wild, so please just leave them alone. * There are also some cats in the world who were handled when they were kittens but it was too long ago or not enough petting or they didn't know any gentle humans and they got traumatized, or whatever. If that was their only petting experience, then chances are that they probably won't ever let a human pet them again. They are not completely wild but can never be completely tame. They are stuck between two worlds. If you meet them, please be nice to them, but don't try too hard to touch them. They will probably be interested in getting near humans, but very reluctant to be touched. If you sit very still, they might come up to you and let you touch them for a moment, but it does not mean that they are or will ever be truly tame. * If you want to let them live in your back yard or on your porch or patio for a while, that's probably okay if they seem healthy, but it's generally best not to let them into your house because they will probably just hide the entire time...and you'll have to eventually either trap them in a trap or a cage in your house, or just leave the door open and let them escape outdoors again. (If they won't come into your house unless you leave the door wide open and no human anywhere nearby, then that's a sign that they probably should not be in your house. * You can leave food and water for them in your yard or on your porch if you want to give them something, but they can never be truly your cats, and they probably will only be around for a short visit anyway. They are usually good cats but not good pets. You have a better chance of finding a pet if you happen to find a cat who acts like he/she has recently been someone's pet...and in that case their human may be still looking for them and want them back, so please try to see if you can find their old home before giving them a new home!) 4. Start early. Trying to tame an adult feral cat is not likely to succeed. Start with a kitten or a semi-feral. The younger the kitten, the more likely you are to succeed. It is usually not necessary to take the kitten from its feral mother or isolate it from other ferals; kittens should stay with their mothers until they are at least nine weeks old. Staying with litter mates will help the kittens learn to play gently. If one kitten bites another too hard, the other will bite back just the right amount. After the kitten is about 2 months old, it will become more difficult to tame. * Taking a whole litter of kittens from their mother at about five or six weeks can sometimes be a possible option, for instance if you know where they are at that time but you think she might be about to take them to a more hidden location, or if she is trying to make it hard for you to pet them. At that age they can eat without their mother, and if they have each other they will still have most of their family and be able to socialize with their fellow felines. * Normally, though, it's best that they stay with their mother a few weeks longer. Kittens sometimes continue to nurse for several weeks after they are able to eat solid food. Ideally they should keep living with their mom until they are around two months old...but if you feel that the best way to tame them is going to be to take them away from their mom a little early in the case of a particular litter and/or a particular mother, then you can do that if you need to...but only if you are already very familiar with the health needs, dietary needs and social needs of kittens. Otherwise, consult with a vet, or just try taming the kittens while they are still with their mother. * You can wait for the kittens to get curious about you and come to you, and then pet them very frequently so that they get used to you...or you can gently go up to the kittens when they are with their mother and try petting them as soon as she gets up and leaves, so that they don't all go running after her.) * With very young kittens, under about five/six weeks or so, taming them when their mom is wild is almost the same as taming them when their mom is tame. They don't know to be suspicious yet. Normally it's best for kittens to stay with their mom until they are about nine weeks old, but if their mom is feral or semi-feral then eventually they may learn from her to fear people, plus it is much easier to tame a kitten before the age of about six weeks anyway. * About three or four weeks is probably the ideal age to begin spending a lot of time with them. They do still need either their mother or bottle-feeding, but they do not know yet to be afraid of you, and you can gently pick them up if you want to, just be careful and don't startle them. The same is true of kittens belonging to your own tame cat who has always lived with you; those kittens need to be tamed too, ALL kittens need to be tamed if they are going to be able to live with humans. They are not born tame or born wild; they are born baby kittens. They will be neither tame nor wild at first. When they are still very young, you get to help decide what they will be. 5. Bring the cat family (mother and kittens) indoors if possible. For best results with feral / semi-feral kittens you should begin with them in a cage / crate; otherwise you may end up with ""house ferals"" hiding in corners of the room and almost impossible to catch when needing medication. 6. Get them shots and other basic vet care, such as spaying the mom. (If the kittens are still nursing, wait to spay the mom until after the kittens don't need her milk any more. She might not have milk after being spayed.) * Many cities have feral cat rescue societies that can help you with the daunting prospect of getting the cats to the vet and dealing with them once they are there. Make sure you tell the vet the cat is feral. (The vet can wear gloves if necessary, and/or sedate the cat if necessary.) *"	Remember there are a lot of parasites and diseases outside and kittens can die from even simple worms, so this vet checkup and care is very important. Ringworm can be present on a cat for up to 21 days before the cat shows signs; it is an airborne fungus and can be contagious both to other animals and people alike even before you know it is there, so use good hygiene when working with animals which have been outdoors.

Select the petals and then click on your gradient fill or color fill box, the petals will have a black and white gradient. To change them, drag your yellow, yellow orange and orange color swatches on to your gradient’s color stop. Switch also the type of gradient from linear to radial for a more realistic feel on the petals. 4. Next is to apply a gradient on the center of the sunflower. Select the center of the sunflower or the circle and then click again your gradient fill. Change the colors by dragging again the reddish brown and brown swatches on your gradient’s color stop. Keep the gradient type to radial. 5. Then next is to apply a gradient to the first half of the sunflower’s leaf. Select the first half of the leaf and then click on the gradient fill. Drag again the colors green and yellow green to the gradient’s color stop but change the type of gradient to linear. To change direction of the gradient so that the lighter green will be shown, just drag your mouse downwards. 6. For the second half of the leaf, just select the second half and click again the gradient fill. No need to change the direction of the gradient. 7.	Apply by selecting the water drops and clicking again the gradient fill on your gradient box. Change the colors on the color stop to blue and light blue and then change the direction of the gradient by dragging your mouse upwards.

In order to take a decent selfie, it's easier if you can see yourself facing the phone, instead of turning it around and hoping your face is in the frame. So, if your phone has a ""front-facing camera"", meaning that it can take pictures while you face the screen, it's best to use that. For this, I will be using an iPhone, but the process is similar with most smartphones. 2. Tap the button circled, on your phone, and the camera on the front of your phone will activate, so that you can see your face clearly. 3. Make sure you face is in the frame! This means that the top of your head down to your chin should be within the boundaries of the screen. 4. Some angles are better than others! We usually take selfies to show off our faces, so lets keep it nice. Angling the camera ""forward and a bit above you face"" takes care of double chins. (picture) Turning your face to the side, with more emphasis on one eye, also slims the face and can hide any unwanted acne or marks.  5. Remember the lighting! A good selfie means good light. If it's too dark we can't see your lovely face and it will look blurry. If it's too bright, you might look nose-less! A good key for lighting is natural light, while you face a window. This will light up your face, but there won't be an ethereal halo of outside light surrounding you.  6. Background is important as well! Too many people forget that your surrounding environment is also important. Although your face is the primary focal point, the background is still important to think about, so try to take your selfies with a plain background (ie: a wall, a building, a sheet) or with an object (ie: a cool place where you are, a friend, you pet). Don't take selfies in the bathroom, no one wants to see your toilet.  7."	Change around your angles to see what works best for you, switch the colors of your backgrounds to see what it does to the colors of your face, or make funny faces at the camera! Selfies are usually about one person: you, so if you're not having fun, put down your phone and try again later!

Wear solid black tights. Yeah, black tights may seem like an obvious choice, but they are and have been popular for a reason. Black, opaque tights are the easiest and simplest choice to add a dressier element to your outfit. Plus, black tights make just about anyone’s legs look great. Wear these tights with a pencil skirt, pleated skirt, or long, flowing skirt. Avoid a denim or short skirt unless you work in a super casual environment. If so, lucky you! * Black tights are easily found. You can often black, opaque tights at your local drugstore, like CVS, or supermarket. * Test the tights by stretching them out with your hand to make sure they will be opaque. 2. Choose nude tights. Flesh-colored, opaque tights are usually not the flattering choice because they age you, and really, who wants that? Go for thin, sheer flesh-colored tights instead. Wear nude tights with a knee-length skirt and matching blazer. Accessorize with a patterned shirt to feel like the most stylish person in the office. * Nude tights are also a good option to hide imperfections on your legs. Don’t worry, we all have them. 3. Go for gray tights. Gray tights aren’t drab and boring, they can actually be a good option if you are going for a conservative look.	Wear gray tights with a high-waisted, plaid skirt if you really want to work a schoolgirl look, even at the office. Just be sure to wear a fairly long skirt so you don’t get sent to the principal, or really, the boss.

Identify your goals. Before you begin studying, it is important to identify what your goals are. Set a target grade for each exam and think about what you will need to do to achieve that grade. * Be realistic; consider how well you've been doing all year, how good your understanding of the material is and window of time you have to study. * Don't set your goals too low either. Try to push yourself and set your mind to achieving your full potential. 2. Make a study plan. Making an effective and realistic study plan is a vital component of doing well in your finals. By planning out your study, you can ensure that you will have all the necessary materials covered by the time the exams roll around, thus minimizing stress and maximizing productivity. Here are some things you will need to consider: * Create a time chart of your current activities. Factor in classes, work, time spent with family and friends, etc. This will allow you to see how much free time you have available for study. * Develop a study schedule that works with your timetable. Use time between classes, commute time and any other free time to slot in some extra study. Keep in mind that an hour of study every day will be more productive than a 5-hour block once a week. * Determine your study goals. You shouldn't just write vague guidelines like ""study biology"" -- your study plan needs to be specific. Break down your study material into specific topics and tasks and fill these into your study schedule. Give 20-minute slots to small, bite-size chunks of information and commit to the idea that you will know that information inside out by the end of those 20 minutes. * Stick to your schedule. A study schedule is no good if you don't stick to it. That's why it needs to be realistic. Factor in breaks and potential distraction when planning, so there will be no excuses when the time comes. If it helps, think of the study schedule like a job. You have no option but to do it."	.

Write it on a note. Most girls love getting notes, they are adorable and they can keep them if they want to! But make sure your handwriting is legible because if she has never really seen you before she will imagine what you look like by your handwriting. If your handwriting is sloppy she will imagine a nerd to someone unnatractive. If need be, type it or get someone else to write it. 2. Get to know her. If you havent ever talked before, try to find a way to. If you ever see her, just smile as you walk past. It will make her remember you. Do it whenever you see her, not creepily-dont hunt her down to do it, just as you go about your day to day activities and see her.Then maybe compliment her one day, like saying you like her coat. Now you're on your way to mutual acquantances, and as you get to know the girl btter, you can start to make the moves. 3. Ask her to a dance- people love getting asked to dances. But be careful that she doesn't have her eye on someone already, she might say no because she is hoping for that other special someone to ask her. If this happens ask her again closer to the dance date and say something like 'Did that special someone every ask you to dance?' if she says no than you can ask her again. 4. When you talk to her make sure you talk about her. People love to talk about themselves. Even if you don't really care, pretend like you do and nod your head and such to make her know you are listening. 5. Try talking to her on Facebook or some other social network. This eleminates the fact that she is standing right in front of you and you can think about what your going to write without having an akward silence, or even delete words you wanted to write/say. 6. If you are more bold, then you could ask her to the movies. Either alone or with a whole group of friends (hers and/or yours), or you could just slowly start out with sitting at lunch with her, and then gradually start hanging out with her more and more. 7. Be yourself! Don't pretend to be an artistic person or a hockey jock when your not. Girls like guys who will be themselves around. But don't be an idiot. 8. Don't come on too strong at first. A lot of relationships take time to develop. So don't be impatient. Start with saying ""hi""."	Start conversations with her. But don't do all this at once. Otherwise, you'll just look impatient and nosy. Just be calm and wait for her to get comfortable with you and vice versa. Also, it's best if you become good friends with her before directly asking her out. :)

Understand what deflecting a compliment is really about. If you're uncomfortable receiving compliments, it's likely that you discount compliments and thereby stop the compliments from being made by that person again. The ways of discounting a compliment include: suggesting that it was nothing or that someone else could have done it better, thinking that the complimenter must be after something from you, being embarrassed and blushing or giving a compliment in return, being sarcastic or insisting that the complimenter doesn't mean what they say. Each of these ways of deflecting a compliment results in putting down both yourself and the giver of the compliment, so they're not actually very giving or kind responses. If you have these problems in relation to accepting compliments, try to see the motivation for discounting compliments in a different light: * Modesty: If you think that you're being modest by deflecting a compliment, think again. Modesty is a virtue provided it isn't taken to an extreme; like any other trait, it has to exist in moderation. Modesty becomes a noose around your neck when it cripples your style and causes you to overlook what you're good at and the skills that define you. If you feel you need to compare yourself to someone who is always going to be ""better"" than you, then it's time to stop the comparisons, lower the bar of modesty and start respecting the good things about yourself a whole lot more. * Distrust: If you discount a compliment because you lack trust in the motivations of the giver, then you're being aggressive or hostile. You're immediately assuming that this person is being sycophantic and is weaseling their way into your good books just for their own purposes. While there is a possibility from time to time that an occasional person might be telling a white lie, most people are genuine about giving compliments and deciding on whether or not someone is trustworthy on the basis of compliments is a daft approach to life. * Trying to match the compliment: If you feel obliged to give a compliment in return for a compliment, it's likely that you're a people pleaser and that you're trying to self efface by batting back the compliment. If you think ""I can't keep this compliment, they deserve it more than me!"" and immediately scramble to bat it back to them, then it's possible you're denying the beauty of the compliment you earned based on your own behavior and way of being. 2. Think about taking a compliment as an exercise in being assertive. An assertive person knows their self worth and appreciates acknowledgement but neither seeks it out nor rebuffs it when received. More importantly, an assertive response is a recognition that you are worth the compliment and that you are entitled to quell any negative voice that seeks to deflect the compliment. 3. See accepting a compliment as a compliment in itself. In accepting a compliment, you are telling the other person that you trust their judgment, their wisdom and their sense of self. And that you appreciate what they have to say about you."	This helps you to acknowledge the compliment and express appreciation for it being given to you. Most importantly, since giving a compliment is a form of uttering an opinion, stop yourself from disagreeing with it or you risk downplaying someone else's opinion.

This helps you to acknowledge the compliment and express appreciation for it being given to you. Most importantly, since giving a compliment is a form of uttering an opinion, stop yourself from disagreeing with it or you risk downplaying someone else's opinion. 4. Decide how you'd like to take the compliment. While it's clear that you can deflect or discount a compliment in various ways, you can also respond to a compliment positively in a number of ways. It really depends upon the context that you're in and how you're perceiving the compliment. In particular, you can choose an appropriate response to a compliment depending on whether you'd like to accept the compliment itself at face value, even if you don't agree with it or you'd like to accept the compliment's substance and reflect that in your response, perhaps even using it to engage on further conversation: * When accepting the compliment as it is, even if it's not something you agree with, keep the reply simple and stay focused on the fact of receiving the compliment and be appreciative that the person was happy to compliment you. Some examples are: * ""Thank you very much"" or just ""thank you"". These are simple, timeless classics that should be easy enough to utter even if the compliment has caught you off guard. If that's all you can think to say, leave it at that. * ""Thanks, I appreciate that."" * ""Thank you; that's a really lovely thing to say."" * ""Thanks - that's makes me feel really good."" * ""Thanks. That means a lot to me."" * ""Thanks, you're a kind person."" * When accepting a compliment in a way that shows that you're appreciative of the substance of the compliment, this can really help to make the person giving the compliment feel that they've hit the right spot. Some examples are: * ""Thanks. I'm really glad you noticed that because it's something I'm proud of too."" * ""Thanks! I'm so enthusiastic about this project, so it's great to know you're keen too."" * ""Thanks. I like it too – that's why I bought it even though I had to save up for ages."" * ""Thanks. I had fun making it and it's great to know you like it."" * ""Thanks. It has been in my family for generations."" * ""Thank you! I tried really hard."" This is a really good response when somebody has praised your effort, as there is never any harm in acknowledging effort and that the outcome wasn't simply a fluke. * It's often good to use the compliment to further conversation. Say something like: ""Thanks! I found it in New Look - it's amazing what you can get there."" That way you've accepted the compliment and moved on to something about which you can both talk. 5. Smile. When taking a compliment, smiling says a lot without requiring you to say anything. You've probably earned it, so enjoy your moment in the spotlight. Also, pay attention while you're being complimented. If you give a person a half-hearted reply such as ""whatever"" or ""mhm,"" don't expect that person to be quick to compliment you again. An expressive ""thank you"" is much better than ""uh-huh"". 6. If you suspect that the sincerity of the compliment is questionable or the compliment is confusing, you might want to open up an opportunity to explore it. This step is absolutely optional because on the whole, this approach is not recommended, for the very reason that there is more to be gained from letting insincere compliments float off you unacknowledged than there is by tackling them. Be totally aware that it would be really unfortunate if you have misjudged the compliment and see insincerity where there is none – that could really offend the other person. However, if you feel that you really need to question the compliment, you might approach it like this: * ""It just strikes me that you didn't make a sincere compliment then. Are you being open/frank with me when you say that you like what I am wearing/doing/writing/creating, etc? I'd rather know that you're not happy about something I've done/said than to dance around the edges. At least if I know, I can strive to make changes."" 7. Return a compliment later. Remember when a person has complimented you and note that it's nice and courteous to return it in a short space of time. Some people like to compliment straight away but as discussed above, you do need to be very careful that you're doing this for genuine reasons and not simply as a way of discounting the original compliment made to you. If you're not sure, then don't give a compliment at the time you're given one but do remember to return a compliment at another opportune moment. In fact, just get into the habit of making regular compliments through seeing the good in others and expressing this openly, as a part of who you are. * Simply say something nice about the person who gave you a compliment. A great way to return the favor is to compliment on something of theirs and smile."	.

Understand what subdividing property means. Subdividing property means dividing it into several parts. Land owners typically subdivide their property into multiple residential units. This usually increases the value of the land. * When the land is subdivided into multiple lots, each lot is then sold to one or more buyers. This is more profitable than keeping the property as one residential unit. *	This increases the overall value of the land.

Check for restrictions. Make sure there are no local ordinances, neighborhood covenants or deed restrictions that may block your plans. A title search will identify any of these problems as well as any the existence of any outstanding liens or other claims on the land. * Find a title company. Your real estate agent or lender can recommend one with whom they usually work, or you can get recommendations from peers. The title company does the title search to make sure that the seller has the legal right to sell the property. They also offer title insurance. * Once the title company verifies the validity of the title, they will release a title opinion letter that states their findings. * At this point, the title company will also issue title insurance. Title insurance protects the buyer if previous owners or debtors state they have a claim on the property. * During the title search, the title company scrutinizes old deeds to verify that the seller is the only owner of the property. The title search also uncovers any unpaid debts on the property, such as taxes, liens or loans. 2. Estimate the impact of the market on your subdivided property. Make sure there is a market for lots in your area. Sell them at a price that makes sense. Research the market and other properties in the area to determine a lot size, layout and price that is marketable in the area. * Consult a trusted real estate agent with experience in the area for advice on this matter.	.

Perm your hair every 6 to 8 weeks depending on your hair's needs. Do not perm your hair every time new growth appears. For one week following your relaxer, use a reconstructor instead of your regular conditioner when you wash your hair. Aphogee makes an excellent reconstructor and shampoo. After a week return to your regular shampoo and conditioner. 2. Wash and condition your hair every 3 to 4 days and at the most once a week. Try to use shampoo and conditioner designed for dry hair. Ultra Black Hair and Tresseme for damaged hair are excellent conditioners. Rarely if ever use a towel or a blow dryer to dry your hair. Instead, to prevent damage, air dry the hair, separating it with your fingers as it dries. 3. It is best to avoid using heat to dry your hair, however, if you prefer heat, then avoid hand held dryers. Use a hood dryer instead. With repeated usage, all hair dryers will damage and dry-out your hair, but the hood type will not damage it as quickly. The hair should be completely dry before you use a curling or flat iron on it. 4. When using a curling iron to style your hair, do not allow the barrel cover to clamp down on your hair. Hold the barrel cover slightly open and allow the hair to move over the curling iron barrel without the tugging and pulling caused by pressure from the barrel cover. Whenever the barrel cover clamps down on your hair it creates a weak point at which breakage is inevitable. 5. Never use hair oil on relaxed hair. The usage of hair oil on relaxed hair is the major reason African American hair breaks off at such an alarming rate. If your hair is well conditioned you won't need any oil. 1. The use of hair oil is, of course, an individual choice. If you find that a little hair oil is not damaging to you hair and you do prefer to use some oil, go ahead and rub a small amount in the palms and spread lightly through the hair. Keep in mind excessive hair oil may make your hair stiff and because it cannot move naturally it may break off (especially if you do not wash it frequently). Mineral oil or petroleum are very damaging.	.

Mark the date on which you're attending the class for the first time. Have enough time for yourself to deal with the 'psychological' part first. Make a clear vision of 'what to dos' and 'what not to dos' by knowing the level you're teaching. Remember the moment when you were the student and a new teacher enters the class. 2. After you know who to teach, learn what to. Always remember the fact that students are curious about the teachers at their very first class, not the subject matter. So DO NOT plan to teach very tough topic that day. Don't get overexcited but don't fear the day. Be calm. 3. Be sure to know what to say at the very first instant and the very last instant. You may try something out in front of the mirror if you think you're really nervous. 4. On the following day, wear gentle clothes so that you'd not be too concerned about it. Be punctual to the class. As you enter the class, greet your students casually. Smile. Make your students comfortable. Tell them you're bit nervous because you're going to teach wonderful students like them. 5. Introduce yourself in short. Have a sense of humor on 'gentle' matters. DON'T ever make fun of students. If you're teaching elementary, try to merge yourself with the students. Maintain a constant verbal speed. Pause shortly. Don't ever look at the eyes of just few students. If you feel eyes are fearsome, look at the space between students rather than their eyes. This makes you more relaxed. 6.	Bid them goodbye.

You could use Rit dye, or you can buy a nifty little kit from your local craft store. Since you are reading this, I am assuming you dont have a kit and no directions to follow. 2. Using Rit dye, (I am assuming that you are) you should get some type of bottle to dispense it. A good idea would be to use something like a mustard or katchup bottle you would find in some restraunts. You would want something just like that, only maybe just a little smaller. I guess you could use those, you would just have to write what colors are in them. 3. Get a white T-shirt, and wet it. Wring it out pretty good, so it is damp. Lay the shit out on a flat surface. Put your finger in an area around the middle. That will be the circle of your spiral. 4. Leaving your finger in the middle of the shirt, you are going to begin to wind the shirt around your finger, making sure the shirt stays relatively flat. Continue to do that until you get it all wound up. It should be about as tall as a doorknob, and the diamater relatively close to that of a saucer. 5. Once that is done, you should put rubber bands around it. I use three to four. You should space them out relatively evenly, so it sorta looks like a pie. 6. Once that is done, you need to fill up your sink with just enough water so that the shirt can be fully submerged. Then, you need to take the soda ash, and pour a good bit into the water. Not a ton, but a desent amount.	Let the shirt soak in that for about 20-25 minutes. When the 20 minutes are up, ring the shirt out fairly well. DO NOT RINSE.

If you have a better understanding of your personal way of communicating, you can gain a better understanding of how you may be interpreted. This could help avoid confusion and conflict, but it might also help you alter your style if you know your ex won’t react well to your typical style. For example, if you are normally someone who comes across as very direct, but you know your ex scares easily, you may want to tone down how direct you are, at least until they get use to you. * Affiliative communicators tend to like collaboration. When they need to make a decision, they obtain multiple opinions from different people before coming to a conclusion. This means they are very likely to listen to what their partners suggest and take that opinion into consideration when making their decision. * Competitive communicators like power and dominance. They tend to make decisions on their own without collaboration. They’re likely to be assertive (but not necessarily aggressive), direct and will sometimes challenge others who may disagree with them. * Direct communicators are exactly that - direct. They say it like it is, and don’t beat around the bush. If they want something specific, they’ll tell you. If they don’t like something you’re doing, you’ll know. This directness allows this type of communicator to be understood pretty quickly. There is usually little confusion about what it is that they want. Sometimes direct communicators may come across as forceful or aggressive. * Indirect communicators have trouble telling others what they think, want, or need. They may make implications about things that they hope someone will understand by reading between the lines. There tends to be a lot more confusion and misunderstandings with this type of communication, but it may also seem less aggressive. 2. Remember to be an active listener. Listening is a vital part of any communication. Being aware of what your ex is telling you (what they’re saying AND what they mean) is referred to as active listening. Active listening is even more important when you think about all the distractions you are likely to encounter when you’re having a conversation. Your cell phone, honking cars, TVs, arguing people, etc., all have a way of taking your attention away from your ex and directing that attention elsewhere. There are many specific things you can do to train yourself to be a better active listener. * Restate and summarize what you’ve just been told.	By restating and summarizing what you’ve heard, your ex not only knows you were paying attention, they will know whether you actually understood what they were trying to get across.

Know when to use Vlookup. Vlookup is a function in Excel that allows you to type the value of one cell to look up the value of a corresponding cell in the same row. Imagine being a teacher with a student list in Excel. You could use Vlookup to type the name of the student and immediately be given their grade from a corresponding cell. This is handy for long lists or looking up repetitive information. 2. Understand the values/arguments. In order to use Vlookup in Excel, you will have to enter four total functions, like code, called arguments. Each of the four correspond to a certain piece of information in your spreadsheet. They must all be entered accurately in order to get precise results. * ”Lookup value” is the value you are searching for in your table or list. It will always be in the leftmost or first column. In the student list example, it would be referring to the name of the student. The bit of code you use to represent the lookup value is the cell number you are entering the Vlookup function in. For example, if your table of information is in columns A and B, and you type your Vlookup code in the cell F3, then your lookup value is F3. It will be searching the first column, A, for your entered item though. * ”Table array” is the location of where you would like to search. Imagine that you have two columns total, one with student names and the other with their grades. If you have 30 students with your list starting in cell A2 and ending in cell A32 with names, and grades starting in cell B2 and ending in cell B32, you want Vlookup to search all the items included in those cells. Therefore, your table array would be A2:B32; it is the first cell you use on the top left, and the last cell you use on the bottom right. * The “column index number” refers to the column that you want Vlookup to give you the result from. So if you are looking for a student’s grade, you would enter the lookup value of: John Smith with the intended result of getting a specific grade, for example “3.5 GPA.” If this grade is in the second column of your spreadsheet (column B), then the column index number would be 2. * The “range lookup” is asking whether you need an exact match or a rounded number. The two options for what you might enter for this argument are “true” or “false.” If you enter “true,” you are saying that you do ‘’’not’’’ need an exact number. For example, if a student’s GPA was 3.68, you would be telling it to round the number to 3.7. If you enter “false,” you are saying that you ‘’’do’’’ need an exact number. Having “false” written in the code is telling Vlookup that the number you want is exact - 3.68, not rounded to 3.7. 3. Avoid basic mistakes. It’s not too difficult to use Vlookup, but just be sure that you are following all the basic rules of the program in order for it to work correctly.	That means that you must have the information in your Excel spreadsheet placed in vertical columns, rather than in cells in rows. Vlookup will search rows vertically, not rows horizontally.

But make sure he likes you. Ask his closest friends. * You could also spread a rumor that you like him and see how he reacts when he hears it. See if he looks happy or relieved. * Just invite him to a party then he might like you back. * Just go for it and everything might just fall into place. * Talk to him in a way that is cool, and not too intimidating to the guy. * Rejection is hard, but not knowing is hard too. If you like him because of his personality it's likely that he likes you too because you have things in common. * Even if you are rejected, there may be a chance in the future that he will develop his own crush on you, and rethink why he even rejected you in the first darn place. * Remember: if you are not ready to tell him then don't. * If you want to tell him but are too worried, then see if he will tell you first. If he doesn't give a truthful answer or you think he is covering it up and you still want to tell him, you will have to do it yourself. * Be careful not to come off too strongly because it might send him the wrong message. * Don't be needy or aloof. * If he does something funny laugh in a cute but real way and make direct eye contact. If he is an entertainer type of boy then don't hold in laughter let it out he will appreciate it. * If he is a friend, try to act the same around him as you always would, but still act cute around him. * Don't text him to tell him that you like him, he might not answer. Instead, call him or tell him face to face. * If he doesn't ask who it is, move on. There are other guys out there. Even the fact that he dares to ask shows you he cares at least a little. Either that, or he is suspicious, but very shy. If your birthday isn't coming up anytime soon, then mention the next big holiday. Don't lie about when your birthday is. Or if its the summer, tell him that you want a boyfriend to begin the new school year, or for the next big event that you both will be attending. * Be yourself. * Don't tell your friends to go and tell him. He'll think that you aren't confident and that you're weird. * Let him get to know you first before you go and tell him you like him. He might not be attracted to you or know you. *	.

Does the soil have rocks underneath it? Remove the rocks so you can get to the root of the weed. Then try to pull it out. 3. If it isn't the soil, though, the plant might be holding on with its roots, or connected to another weed (like grass), so you'll have to use a shovel or trowel (mini shovel) to dig around it and pull it out by the base. 4.

Understand the purpose of your affidavit. Before you begin to write anything down, make sure you understand what issues are in dispute and why you've been called on to provide supporting evidence. * You need to know this so you can ensure that your affidavit will contain relevant information. If your observations aren't relevant to anything at issue in the case, it won't be admissible. * For example, suppose your friend's custody of her child is being challenged by the child's father, who alleges that she is abusive. You want to focus on observations you've had that tend to demonstrate your friend is not abusive to her child. 2. Check for affidavit forms. Some states provide affidavit forms, also called ""declarations."" If you can find one, you should be able to use it for formatting purposes, but you'll have to adapt it to suit your own needs. 3. Create your caption. Since other documents have been filed in the custody case, you should use one of those documents as a guide. * The heading information on the top of the first page is called the ""caption."" Usually it includes the name of the court, the names of the parties, and the case number. * This information should remain the same in all documents filed in the case, both in content and format. Simply copy the caption of one of those documents. 4. Title your affidavit. Drop two lines below the caption and type a title, whether ""Affidavit of [Your Name],"" or simply ""Character Affidavit."" * You should use a previously filed document in the case as a guide for how to format the title, as document formatting preferences differ in each court. Generally titles are centered and in bold-face type. Some courts prefer the title to be in all capital letters or underlined. 5. Identify yourself and your relationship to the party in the case. Start the body of your affidavit by introducing yourself to the court. * You may use the traditional, formal language if you prefer, which is ""Comes now [your name], a nonparty, and states as follows:"" followed by numbered statements. * Each numbered statement typically covers one subject. It may be one sentence or several. * Make a statement regarding your belief that the person for whom you're writing this affidavit has good moral and ethical character. 6. Describe your background. Explain to the court who you are and any part of your background or experience that makes you a more credible witness. * For example, if you are the child's baseball coach and have observed the parent interact with the child at games and at practices, you might also mention here how long you've been a youth baseball coach and approximately how many parent-child relationships you've observed. 7. Write about your observations. Give specific, numbered examples of things you've personally observed that demonstrate and support your belief about the person's character. * Follow the general writing advice: ""show; don't tell."" Show the court specific facts or scenes that illustrate the good character of the person, rather than simply saying the person has a good reputation, or that in your opinion they have strong morals. * Stay away from vague statements such as ""Dad is an actively involved parent."" Instead, provide specific instances of Dad's active involvement. For example, if you're the child's baseball coach, you might mention that Dad comes to every practice and every game, and also helps the team in the dugout. * Be cautious of including facts that don't necessarily indicate good moral character on the person's part. For example, you may believe that active membership in a church is evidence of good moral character, but that would not necessarily be persuasive evidence for someone of a different religion. * Keep your facts unbiased. Rather than setting forth church membership as evidence of character, talk about the things the person did through the church. For example, building a house for a needy family or operating a canned-food drive could be good character evidence. *"	If you know of positive attributes of the other parent, include that information as well. Entirely one-sided affidavits may raise suspicions.

Go beyond reading a speech. Even being as helpful as it is, using a teleprompter is not enough in executing a good speech. There are still noticeable, tell-tale signs that the reader is just reading, and not making a good performance. It can be heard in their slight, unnatural pauses and uncomfortable phrasing; seen in their wandering eyes and odd gestures. * This may be the most important thing for a speaker to learn and understand. Reading is not enough. A great speech needs to be involving and moving, speaking to the audience rather than a screen or a wall — prompters, when used properly, are extremely effective in helping to achieve this. So here are some things one must remember to do when using a prompter: 2. Be familiar with your speech. This does not mean that you have to memorize each and every line in your text. No — what you must do is know your speech. This means knowing what you want with it. Know your motive, your message, and your purpose. Familiarizing your speech will help a great deal when delivering it. When you really know the points you are trying to get across, you can make changes in phrasing if you get lost in your speech without losing its meaning. 3. Communicate openly with your teleprompter operator. It is a must that you and your operator understand each other. Having good manners and respect in your workplace will help in this aspect. Voice your concerns. If you are not okay with the way the text appears onscreen, let them know. It is you who are the captain. So be sure that when you step in front of the camera and the prompter, you feel ready to run the show. 4. Rehearse. Though the prompter contains all the words in your speech, practice is still important.	Practice your gestures, your movements, even your eye line. Enough practice will absolutely make things better, if not perfect.

It's extremely important to pay attention and stay focused on what's going on around you. Just keep an eye on your belongings and don't get close to that weird person that seems to have been looking at you for a long time - he/she may be a thief. 3. It's good to consider that if car accidents take place, people that walk closer to the streets are more likely to suffer injuries. So, be careful! Walking near to the ""store's side"" is a very useful advice. 4. Crossing streets sometimes can get really dangerous. If you don't look carefully to the cars and the traffic lights, you may be a product of a not really comfortable consequence, such as an accident. Therefore, it is essential to walk on the zebra line - and to walk on it while cars are not moving around and the traffic lights are RED. 5. If you are planning to go across a two ways' street, make sure no cars are visible on both sides. 6. Avoid wearing sandals or flip-flops, and high-heels. If, on your way there's a rock, you may trip on it, fall or even die, hit by a car. USE TENNIS SHOES! 7."	Fashion nowadays has become really... vast.

Active transport across the cellular membrane is another common feature of all cells of the various organisms. This active transport usually requires energy which is supplied in the case of humans by the molecules of ATP. Also another common feature of all cells of the living systems is the biological process of osmosis. 5. This process refers to the movement of water between the various compartments of the body by the effect of concentrations gradient that is called osmolality between these compartments. Metabolic reactions in general have the purpose of maintaining and sustaining the life of the individual. This is exemplified by the metabolic processes of energy generation in the cells of the liver by the processes of glycolysis and krebs cycle in addition to the process of oxidative phosphorylation. 6. All these metabolic processes have one aim which is the formation of energetic ATP molecules for the cells of the body. Metabolic reactions that generate energy for the living humans are dependent of the supply of the sugar glucose to the body. Many organisms rely on this sugar for their energy production. In humans glucose is the ultimate source of fuel in the brain and the eye retina. Also the brain can generate energy using ketones in diabetic patients that rely of fatty acids for their production of ATP molecules. 7. Important metabolic reactions in humans include the active transport of nutrients and ions across the cellular membrane of the various cells in the body. This active transport is especially important in neurons and muscle cells. Failure of these mechanisms in the living system can lead to its inevitable death. This process of active transport is maintained by the effect of enzymes that catalyze this process. 8. This process also requires energy in the form of ATP molecules to drive the transport process to completion. Metabolism in the human body can involve many biochemical compounds including amino acids and fatty acids in addition to other compounds such as the metabolism of hormones and neurotransmitters. The metabolism of hormones is especially important due to its physiological role in the body. The neutralization of the hormonal function is important after its physiological effect is performed. This is usually done in the cells of the liver. 9. Liver failure can lead in certain cases to the sustaining of the continuous function of the particular hormone. This in turn can have clinical symptoms that are related to the individual hormone. Amino acids are metabolized in the liver into intermediates of the krebs cycle that can be used to generate ATP molecules in that metabolic process. The metabolism of fatty acids is of particular importance due to its potential to form energy in the form of ATP molecules by the oxidation of the fatty acids. 10. Fatty acids metabolism is of particular importance in diabetic patients which rely of these acids for the formation of ATP molecules. Neurotransmitters are a very important class of compounds that have important biological effects on the nervous system. Therefore, knowing the exact metabolism of these neurotransmitters is of clinical value. 11.	Certain pharmacological drugs use the metabolic pathways for the synthesis of DNA bases as a target to stop the synthesis of cancerous cellular DNA.

Think about the frog's habitat. It will need a tank, water, algae killer,small rocks and some shells(shells are optional). After you have a tank, put the tank where you want to keep the frog.Then put room temperature non-chlorinated water in it until in is 3/4 full. Then place a bunch of shells in the bottom, positioning them so that the frog has plenty of places to hide. 2. Clean the tank every month for most aquatic frogs, but some like the water murky, such as African Water Frogs, so you won't have to clean it as often. When you clean the tank, take a bucket and put about 5 inches of room temperature non-chlorinated water in it.	Then take a different bucket and scoop the water out and throw it outside. Keep doing this until the tank is light enough to carry. Then carry it to your sink. Dump the shells into a pile. Use water and a scrub brush to scrub out any algae and slime. Then rinse the tank and put it back where it normally lives and put room temperature non-chlorinated water in it 3/4 full. Add some non-harmful algae killer in with the water as you pour it in. Then, scrub the shells with the scrub brush and water. Then set them back into the tank. Pour the bucket of water with the frogs in it into the tank.

Make them clear. * Draw a box around assignments and suggested books so you can identify them quickly. * Mark ideas which the lecture emphasizes with a highlighter, arrow or some special symbol. * When the teacher looks at his/her notes, pay attention to what they say next.Check any notes you may have missed with a classmate. * Incorporate different colors of ink, diagrams, drawings of your own. Make your notes your notes. Take advantage of how you learn (visually, orally, or actively) and write/draw your notes according to that style. * Watch for signal words. Your instructor is not going to send up a rocket when He/she states an important new idea or gives an example, but she will use signals to telegraph what she is doing. Every good speaker does it, and you should expect to receive these signals. For example, she may introduce an example with ""for example"" as done here. Other common signals:He/She may signal support material with: * If you can, bring a tape recorder. Do take notes, however, but listen to the lecture again later where you can stop and play while completing the notes on the Lecture. A better way is to record the lecture on a small camera."	The important thing is to process the information in your head, not to record it on your recorder. Note taking -even when only 70% is taken down- is more beneficial than 100% recording, because you you make yourself process the information while jotting it down.

Take over-the-counter oral pain medications to relieve pain. Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and aspirin are all good options to help relieve the pain. Naproxen sodium is also a valid choice. Take the medications as needed and as directed by your doctor. * For aspirin, try 1-2 pills (325 milligrams each) every 4 to 6 hours. Don't take more than 4,000 milligrams in 24 hours. Acetaminophen is similar, except you can take 2 325-milligram pills every 4 to 6 hours. * For ibuprofen, aim for 1 pill (200 milligrams) every 4 to 6 hours. Don't take more than 6 pills in 24 hours. * With naproxen, take 1 pill (220 milligrams) every 8 to 12 hours. Don't take more than 2 pills in any 8- to 12-hour period or more than 3 in a 24-hour period. 2. Try pain relief creams for more direct relief. These creams contain medications like ibuprofen. Rub them into your hip to help reduce the pain and inflammation. Always read the directions, though, as typically you don't want to use a cream with a medication at the same time you're taking the same medication orally. For instance, you wouldn't want to take ibuprofen while using a cream with ibuprofen at the same time. * These creams typically fall into 3 categories: ones with pain relievers, ones with anti-inflammatories (such as NSAIDs, the same category ibuprofen is in), and ones that have a numbing agent, like lidocaine. Talk to your doctor about the best option for you. * Some of these come in spray or patch form, too. 3. Ask your doctor about a steroid shot for long-term pain relief. Your doctor will inject a steroid into your hip, which in turn can reduce inflammation and swelling. Get one every few months to gain relief.	.

First, start with your participants. Who are they? Where did you find them? It is good to say how many there were total, and then break that number up into male/female, or other demographic categories. You might also want to include the average participant age. Finally, state whether or not they received incentive to participate, such as class credit. 2. Next, talk about your stimuli. The stimuli are what the participants will be attending to during the experiment. These are generally pictures or sounds, but could also include pain, temperature changes, etc. Include how they are presented. For example, if you're showing pictures, are they on a computer in front of the participant? You don't need to go into too much detail, i.e. describing every picture, but an example of one or two would be good. 3.	This is the core of the methods section, as other researchers will look to this if they want to replicate your study. How long was each stimulus presented? What did the participants have to do? In some cases, participants will fill out questionnaires prior to the actual experiment. Be sure to include which questionnaires you used. This is basically just a play-by-play of your experiment.

If you are traveling alone, you will be an ""Unaccompanied Minor."" Different airlines have different policies, so be sure to read up before you go. 2. Don't pack a huge carry-on bag. You'll either be crowded by it under the seat or annoyed when you have to be opening the overhead compartment. Just pack a backpack or medium-sized bag especially to carry on with all the stuff you need on the flight. 3. Bring what you like, but don't make it huge and know your limits. If you bring something battery run, bring extra batteries. If it requires charging, fully charge it before the trip. Some airlines will offer USB ports to charge devices (as well normal home plug-ins if possible), but you will have to see if your seat has it. The top essentials for a carry on bag are a tablet with a few movies on it, headphones, a few snacks, a charger, your phone, and gum to help your ears when you land. 4. If your family's seats include an aisle seat, ask for that one. They don't have the stellar views of window seats, but you can get in and out a lot easier (especially when people on the plane started falling asleep). If you still really want a window seat, you'll have to be aware that its complicated getting past the sleeping passengers next to you, so you'll want to use the restroom right before you get on the plane. 5. Unless you're traveling first class, bring snacks in your bag, so you won't have to eat the airplane food. 6. Bring a water bottle on the plane and ask the flight attendants to fill it with water when they come around for meals or snacks. Make sure you drink lots of fluids, especially water 7. Bring a fleece pull-over, a sweater, or a light jacket. Even in the summertime, the planes are cold. 8. If you have a portable DVD/MP3 player, by all means, use it!
