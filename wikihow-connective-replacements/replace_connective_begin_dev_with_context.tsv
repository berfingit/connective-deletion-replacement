Be_a_Tomboy_(Teen_Girls).txt	Begin_Revision	0.935	## Steps	2784	Because you 're a tomboy does n't mean you ca n't be a bit girly .	## Steps	2826	Just because you 're a tomboy does n't mean you ca n't be a bit girly .	<insert><Just><1>|||<replace><Because><1><because><2>	True	Steps  1. Go through your clothes and choose the boyish and sporty ones. Wear them at school. Buy even more boyish clothes, avoid pastel colors, and make sure you don't wear any more than a little bit of pink. Pink can only be allowed in tiny portions when you want to dress like a tomboy! Try to wear blue. It really is a color for tomboys, as are light green, grey and black. 2. Take advantage of any sporting aptitude you have. For example, you may be good at athletics. Play football, basketball and baseball, sometimes soccer. Don't forget softball, dodge ball and other sports like ping pong or lacrosse! If you plan on doing something athletic that day, make sure you aren't wearing a dress or very delicate clothing. Football can be very tough and a dress isn't very good clothing for playing sports. If athletics really isn't your thing, then don't worry, don't become someone you're not. 3. Play boyish games like Mario, Minecraft, and other games like that. Many boys are into Minecraft. If they ask you to play with them, don't be afraid, and look up tips to keep up and consider yourself one of the boys if they invite you to play. 4. Know who you want to be friends with. Befriend the boys in your class but don't get too friendly. They might think you have a crush on them! Get some tomboy friends. They may introduce you to other tomboys and boys and tough girls who are experienced with being a tomboy! 5. Think about your hair. If you're allowed, get your hair cut short. If not allowed, then wear ponytails and do's that are sporty. Don't overdo the makeup. Nail polish is okay, but then, don't do too much pink! 6. Avoid screaming loudly when you are scared. Yell instead, and practice not talking in a very high-pitched voice. 7. Don't get annoyed so soon. Girls always tease you. They're that way. Just ignore them and walk on your own way. One day they'll stop it. 8. Don't try to be tidy. Washing clothes once in a while is okay, but not everyday! Keeping yourself too clean, or being too much untidy-No. In middle of those two is perfect. 9.	If your parents make you wear girly clothing, and you have tried everything to make them stop, explain that your parents are doing this and the boys will know you can't stop it. Make it sound like you really don't like how they do that, and maybe they will help you. Don't expect it though.

Feed the red eared turtle food appropriate for it. A proper diet for red eared turtles (and similar aquatic turtle species) should have the following proportions: Vegetables and water plants 50 percent, commercial foods 25 percent, and live protein 25 percent. Red eared turtles tend to favor protein foods, which can be a trick for the beginner owner who might be lulled into feeding too much protein. Don't––it can cause shell deformation, organ harm and can shorten the turtle's lifespan. Note that juvenile turtles tend to be more carnivorous, while adult turtles turn omnivorous. 550px|Anacharis plant * Good choices for food include: Dandelions (the ones in your yard are good if you don't use pesticides), carrot tops, mustard greens, romaine lettuce, carrots, bell pepper, and squash. * The best greens are water plants like anacharis, water hyacinth, water lettuce, frogbit, hornwort, and duckweed. While expensive in a pet store, these are easy to grow in a separate tank or pond, and they are cheap if you buy in bulk online. * Red eared turtles don't usually eat fruit in the wild, so avoid it except for an absolute treat. If giving a treat, bananas are a good choice. * For commercial food, look for something that has low protein and low fat. Dried shrimp are an absolute no-no! They are like candy to turtles. Tastes great, zero nutrients, and turtles who eat them may refuse other foods for weeks. * Some red eared owners like to feed the turtle in a separate tank. This has the benefit of keeping the water clean. It has the disadvantage of having to be present to shift the turtle when it has finished eating. 2. Check your turtle for signs of health problems. Part of maintaining health is spotting the lack of it. With turtles, there are various conditions and diseases that can occur if the water is dirty, if the diet is inadequate or for other reasons. Some of the more common concerns to watch for include: * Eye infections: Caused by bacteria. The eyes will appear closed, swollen, puffed up or discharging. The turtle should be seen by a vet and probably needs a topical antibiotic plus upgrading the tank's filtration system. * Soft shell: If your turtle's shell is softer than it's supposed to be, your slider may be suffering from soft shell. Soft shell is when your turtle doesn't get enough light from your over head light. If this happens the turtles dock may be too small, the water may be too deep, or the turtle is too weak to get on the dock. If this happens contact your vet or a pet store * Furry mouth and refusal to eat: Caused by bacteria. See the vet immediately for an antibiotic treatment. * Weak, wheezing, lethargic and holding head at an unusual angle: This may be a respiratory infection, such as pneumonia. An immediate vet inspection is warranted. * Wounds: Check the tank for sharp objects or a fighting mate. Remove the cause and treat the wound with povidone-iodine solution and keep it clean. See your vet for more advice. 3. Take your turtle outside sometimes for direct sun. You must supervise outside time, to prevent overheating. One approach is to get a kiddie pool and fill it with some water and provide something for the turtle to bask on. It is also important to provide some sort of shade for your turtle so that it won't overheat. 550px|Kiddie pool 4. Spend time with your turtle. This is your pet and you'll form a bond, as with any pet, if you spend time together. Handle with care––not all turtles like being handled. * Some turtles love to have their shells gently scratched. Just like a back scratch, or scratching behind a dog's ear.	And note that their shells have nerve endings in them and they can feel everything––be gentle.

Boil_Peanuts.txt	Begin_Revision	0.953	## Steps	1311	If they have become tender , and the nut falls from the shell when it is opened , the peanuts are done .	## Steps	1371	When they have become tender , and the nut falls from the shell when it is opened , the peanuts are done .	<replace><If><1><When><1>	True	Steps  1. Select the right peanuts for boiling. Jumbo green peanuts are preferred by many, but most standard oil peanuts work well, so long as they are still green, or uncured (dry). Do not attempt this recipe with roasted peanuts, as they will not become soft, no matter how long you cook them. In the south, farmer's markets and roadside vendors sell green peanuts from early August through mid-October, but the earlier peanuts are usually better for boiling. A good amount to start with is 10 pounds. 2. Wash and pick through your peanuts, removing loose soil and sprouts, stems, weeds, and leaves. You can place your peanuts in a large pot or bucket and use a sprayer on a garden hose to rinse your peanuts, and when the water floats the nuts, the loose debris will float to the top when the contents of the pot is agitated or stirred. 3. Set up a cooker if you are boiling a large amount at one time, or get a good heavy pot to place on the stove. In the photos, the peanuts are boiled outside, using a propane burner and a 20 quart (5 gallon) stainless steel stock pot. 4. Pour your peanuts into the pot, and add enough water to cover them easily. Some will float to the top, so the amount of water may have a deceptive appearance. Push the peanuts down with your (clean) hands, and you will be able to tell how much water is in the pot. 5. Add salt to taste. This can be tricky, but a rule of thumb is to add 1/4 cup salt for every ten pounds of green peanuts. For older, tougher peanuts, more salt may be needed so the nut will absorb enough salt to season your nuts. 6. Add other seasonings if you prefer. Here, sliced jalapeno peppers are added to give the finished peanuts a bit of heat. Garlic, either fresh or powder, liquid crab boil seasoning, chili powder, and other strong spices may be used as well. 7. Bring the contents to a boil. On the propane stove, you light the burner and turn the flame up high, on a cooktop, turn the burner to hi until the water is rapidly boiling, then reduce the heat/flame so that it maintains a rolling boil without wasting excess heat. 8. Stir the peanuts about every 20-30 minutes, making sure the water has not boiled down. Covering the pot will reduce the amount of water evaporating from the pot, but will increase the risk of your pot boiling over while the peanuts cook. 9. After an hour or so, remove some of the peanuts with a slotted spoon and test (taste) them.	.

Wear clothes with colors that suit you. Certain colors complement certain skin tones, while others tend to bring out the worst. Also take into consideration your hair color. You may have a feel for which colors you look best in, but if not, do some research (check out the external links below) and some trial-and-error. 2. Hide your blemishes. The bad thing about photographs is that because they are simply frozen images of one angle in an instant in time, they can't show all your good attributes. The good thing about them is that you can easily hide certain features you don’t like. If you've got a unsightly look on one side of your face, for example, don’t show the camera that side. 3. Determine your best angle. Beyond the obvious hiding of blemishes, finding the right angle for your face can be a bit more difficult. The best thing you can do is experiment using a digital camera so that you can immediately see the results of each pose. It will very quickly become obvious which angles are most flattering for you, and you can then use that angle as much as possible in the future. The classic model's pose is to arrange your body 3/4 toward the camera with one foot in front of the other and one shoulder closer to the camera than the other. This isn’t the best pose for everybody, however, and it can look a little ridiculous when used in a family photo right next to your Uncle Bob. 4. Get rid of a double chin. Tilt your head down slightly and try to position yourself so that the camera is a little above your eye level. This will hide a double chin fairly effectively. You can also put one hand under your chin as though you’re resting your head on your hand (keep the thumb side of your hand out of the camera’s view, if possible). Don't actually rest any weight on the hand, however, or you will push the skin into an unflattering position. Also try resting your tongue against the roof of your mouth. 5. Stick your neck out. One trick models often use is to present a 3/4 pose to the camera (turn your head so that 3/4 of your face is exposed to the camera, as opposed to a full frontal shot) and then lift your neck and slightly tilt your head down, as though you are a turkey sticking its head out (without actually thrusting your chin out). This improves facial definition and helps ameliorate wrinkles and flabby skin. 6. Relax. Many people end up looking odd in photos because they freeze into odd facial expressions with a “say cheese"" type of smile on their face. If you're used to having bad pictures taken of yourself, you probably get nervous in front of the camera, and this can make things even worse. If you know a picture is about to be taken, take a deep breath and exhale naturally, relaxing your arms and shoulders. As you exhale, smile or strike whatever pose is appropriate. Don't hold your breath, either in or out, otherwise you'll appear as though you're tense or suffocating. If you see the photo coming too late, don’t panic and try to strike a pose. Keep doing what you're doing and try to ignore the camera. It may not turn out perfectly, but you’ve got a better chance than if the camera catches you quickly trying to change your facial expression. The more comfortable and relaxed you appear, the better the photo will turn out. 7. Think happy thoughts. An unnatural, forced smile can make you look stiff and, frankly, weird. When people are smiling and waiting for a photo to be snapped, their facial muscles can get caught in all sorts of strange positions. To remedy this, try to time your smile so that you don't have to hold it for too long. Also, imagine something really funny (don't be afraid to laugh a bit, even) or think of someone—your spouse or child, for example—who makes you happy. By doing so, you’ll get a genuine smile. If you don't like your smile or your teeth, try a more subdued, closed- or partially-closed-mouth smile. Regardless of how you choose to smile, the happier and more relaxed you are, the better. 8. Smile with your eyes. Nothing projects happiness and beauty like smiling eyes: a happy, somewhat mischievous expression of the eyes. To achieve this effect, imagine that the camera is a person you have a crush on walking into the room. This will create wider open eyes and a relaxed smile. Chances are you unconsciously do this all the time; the trick is to be able to bring it out on demand, so practice the smiling eyes in front of a mirror. 9. Maintain your posture. Listen to your mother — remember how she always told you not to slouch? Good posture can dramatically improve your appearance in pictures. Sitting or standing up straight will make you look healthier and more alert and, if in a group setting, more attractive than your slouching companions. Just remember to breathe normally and relax your shoulders. Especially if you usually have bad posture, it may be difficult to stand up straight and not look stiff, so practice this in the mirror. 10. Get a better photographer. Professional photographers generally know how to bring out the beauty in people. You can't always choose your photographer, but sometimes you can. If you're going to put up a shot for an online dating service, consider enlisting a professional. If you need headshots for modeling, get the best professional you can find. 11. Edit or enhance photos. If you've tried everything, but you still can’t seem to get a good picture of yourself in any environment, try slightly altering your digital photos. Changing the lighting effects or filter effects, for example, can dramatically improve the appearance of your complexion. 12. Fake it till you make it. People are often photogenic because they like having their picture taken. They are therefore relaxed and happy when the camera appears. If you cannot muster up genuine love of the camera, pretend you like the camera. Imagine the camera is someone you love, a long lost friend, an old flame, your child at age three, or whatever you need to look at the camera lovingly. Try it—it really does work. 13. Keep the shine down. It is so important to keep the shine down in the ever-troublesome t-zone - the top of your nose and your forehead. Especially on a warm day but even the coolest among us may get a little sweaty when faced with the lens of a camera. 14. Relax your lip(mouth) region and don't have any delirious thoughts filled with gloom. It's a natural way to appear fresh and appealing in photo graphs. 15. Be graceful in your movements. 16. Keep your face in equilibrium Look at your face in the mirror. That's NOT actually the face which comes in your photograph. Now stare at your own reflection. After some time your face will reach the 'normal' condition. That will be your 'equilibrium' face. Now deactivate your eye region and activate your lip region. Don't clench your teeth, just make sure that your upper and lower jaw molars touch each other. Always smile if your complexion is dark or dull and your smile should be a slight one. At the same time stress the corners of your eyes and raise your eye brows a little. Practice this exercise every day before mirror for a few minutes. In one month it will become a habit whenever someone tries to take a photograph of you."	.

Hire an adoption attorney. When you are ready to legally adopt your child, find a local adoption attorney to handle the process. The attorney will file your adoption petition in court, help you gather and submit the paperwork you need, and walk you through the ins and outs of the legal proceedings. Visit the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys website at http://www.adoptionattorneys.org/aaaa/home to find an attorney near you. 2. File an adoption petition. An attorney will take care of the bulk of the work to file an adoption petition with the court. Make sure to give them all the necessary documents (e.g. papers from the adoption agency) so they can prepare the petition and file the documents with the court on your behalf. While it is possible to file the petition without the aid of an attorney, you will save time, stress, and possible filing mistakes with their assistance. 3. Appear before a judge to get the adoption finalized. A judge will review the petition for adoption and schedule a trial date for an official review. During the hearing the judge will decide if you have followed the adoption procedure properly and assess whether or not you are fit to be an adoptive parent to your child.	.

What exactly am I feeling right now? This may not always work. But, at least in some cases, pausing to scrutinize your thought patterns can lead to healthier decisions. * It can also help to take a moment to inventory, mentally, what you've already eaten that day. Often, this can trigger your brain to feel satisfied, rather than longing for more. 2. Visualize rewards (and consequences). Other psychological research shows that visualizing desired behavior can help you follow through on it. * Pause for a moment and try to imagine, as vividly as you can, the rewards of making the right decision. Try also to imagine the consequences of making the unhealthy choice. * For example, imagine yourself ten pounds lighter, and what you will look like if you consistently eat a healthy diet.	.

Always be polite to those who are polite to you, and always sit with your legs crossed, your arms folded around your knees, with a concentrating look. 3. If a hater jerks off to you, just smirk and smile. Come close to them and say loudly (but not too loudly; you want to attract attention, not a lower reputation!) ""Oh, you little brat. Stop whining about it, and if you don't stop telling me off like this, your life will be over, but it already is."" Walk off somewhere else with a flip. Once you get back after flashing a devilishly smile at them but say, ""Oh! AND if you even DARE to try to get revenge, I'll ruin you."" Then raise your eyebrows,with an evil smile and wink. Immediately get on to something else after the wink. 4. Still be nice to your friends, but hang out with higher-ranked people more often than you do with them. If your old friend annoys you, spill a BFFs-only secret to the pops. Not only will you go one step higher to being a gossip queen, but the pops will totally respect you more, and you can't be the gossip queen without being a pop! 5.

This will help stimulate new hair growth, condition your roots, and protect your hair. 3. Use a comb to disperse the oil. Comb it from your roots to the tips of your hair. Make sure all of your hair gets coated with a small amount of oil. 4. Cover your hair. Put on a shower cap and let the oil absorb into your scalp and hair for about an hour. If you have time, leave it on overnight. 5. Shampoo your hair. Use shampoo to wash the oil from your hair. If you rinse without shampooing, it'll leave your hair looking oily.

Fulfill your obligations. You must also sell the car in a “commercially reasonable manner.” This standard is a little vague. Often, it means selling the car at a public auction. However, private sales can sometimes be commercially reasonably if you engage in fair and honest dealing. Make sure that you avoid doing the following, which is not “commercially reasonable”: * don't sell the car as junk without doing an appraisal * don't buy the vehicle back (after the sale) and then resell it for a higher price * don't sell the car in a private sale when most repossession sales in your area are conducted by public auction * don't refuse to advertise * don't sell to family, friends, or employees 2. Advertise the sale. To sell the car properly, you should advertise. You should advertise in a large newspaper or in a trade publication that has a large readership. * In your advertisement, you need to include a proper description of the vehicle. Include the year, make, model, mileage, and general condition of the car (fair, good, excellent). * You can sue the defendant for the costs of the advertisements. Hold onto your receipts from the newspaper or publication. 3. Avoid selling to friends or family. These sales are suspect. You should try to make an “arm’s length” sale to a stranger.	.

Deal_With_Scoliosis_Surgery.txt	Begin_Revision	0.935	### Understanding Scoliosis	2249	If a teenager 's bones stop growing , the risk of scoliosis progression becomes very low .	### Understanding Scoliosis	2320	Once a teenager 's bones stop growing , the risk of scoliosis progression becomes very low .	<replace><If><1><Once><1>	True	"Understanding Scoliosis  1. Learn what scoliosis is. From a side (lateral) view, the spine is normally curved much like the letter ""S"" in order to best support the body, allow for flexibility and to protect the spinal cord. However, when viewed from behind (posterior), the spine should appear fairly straight and not deviate too much to either side. Many people have a few degrees of lateral deviation that's typically ignored and not diagnosed as scoliosis because it doesn't cause any problems. There are many potential causes of scoliosis, including congenital spine deformities (present at birth), spina bifida, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spinal infection, trauma from accidents and certain spinal tumors, although in more than 80% of cases the cause is unknown or a complete mystery. * Although boys and girls develop scoliosis at about equal rates, girls have a much higher risk of severe scoliosis, which often requires surgery. * Scoliosis can run in families (genetic link), but most people diagnosed with scoliosis don't have a family history of the condition. 2. Realize that scoliosis doesn't always require surgery. Scoliosis is relatively straightforward to measure on spinal x-rays, but curves are not considered significant until they are greater than 25-30 degrees. As such, mild and moderate curvatures are not even considered for surgery, regardless if they cause discomfort or not. Mild-to-moderate scoliosis may cause some noticeable deformity, but it's usually too difficult to tell with clothes on. In many cases, the diagnosis of scoliosis sounds much worse than how the condition actually presents or any symptoms that it may cause. People with mild-to-moderate scoliosis live normal lives and can even become top-class athletes, so don't get overly upset or concerned with an initial diagnosis of scoliosis. * Common deformities related to scoliosis include: a prominent shoulder blade that creates a hump, one hip higher than the other (uneven waist), ribs that protrude more on one side, listing to one side while standing or walking, a head that's not centered over the torso. * Most mild scoliotic curves develop without the child or parent realizing because they appear gradually and often don't cause back pain. 3. Recognize when surgery is needed. Although a scoliotic curve is considered significant at around 30 degrees, that's still not enough to warrant surgery. It's not until a curve reaches 40 degrees in an adolescent that a doctor starts to even consider surgery, and then only if there are signs of fairly rapid progression and/or serious symptoms. However, as curves approach 45-50 degrees in a younger teenager, then most doctors recommend surgery not only to combat the growing deformity for cosmetic reasons, but also to reduce the risk of disabling symptoms. Severe scoliosis can be disabling because it pushes the rib cage against the lungs and heart, making it difficult to breathe and forcing the heart to work harder. * Scoliotic curves located in the mid back (thoracic region) grow and worsen more often than curves in the upper (cervical) or lower (lumbar) regions of the spine. * Signs and symptoms of scoliosis typically begin during the growth spurt just prior to puberty — between the ages of 9-15 years old. *"	.

Be aware of the person's health issues. Older adults may have health problems that add difficulty to speaking and understanding. Be sure you consider the person's health before you engage in communication. For example, they may have hearing problems, speech problems, and memory loss. These factors complicate communication. And remember, chronological age is not always a true indicator of a person’s health (see Warnings). 2. Be attentive to the environment you are communicating in. Hearing and speech problems can create a barrier. Be sure to evaluate the environment you are communicating in. Is there any disturbing background noise? Are there many people speaking in the same room? Is there any intrusive music? Are there any distractions that can affect your communication? Ask the older adult if the environment is comfortable to them. If you sense any disturbance, try to go to a more peaceful and quiet place. 3. Speak clearly, articulate, and make eye contact. Older adults may have trouble hearing. It is important to articulate and speak clearly. Direct your speech at the individual and not to the side of the person. Do not eat your words. Move your mouth and pronounce each word carefully and precisely.	If your tongue “sleeps” and plays a passive role, you do not articulate.

Move your mouth and pronounce each word carefully and precisely. If your tongue “dances” inside your mouth when you talk, you articulate. If your tongue “sleeps” and plays a passive role, you do not articulate. 4. Adjust your volume appropriately. There is a difference between enunciating and talking loudly. Learn to adapt your voice to the needs of the individual. Evaluate the environment you are in and the person’s hearing. Sometimes, it is sufficient to interact in a quiet place. Never shout at an older adult. Treat the individual with respect by articulating and speaking at a comfortable volume that is suitable for both of you. 5. Use clear, precise questions and sentences. Do not hesitate to repeat and rephrase your sentences and questions if you sense there is an absence of comprehension. Complicated questions and sentences may confuse older adults who have memory and hearing loss. Clear and precise constructions are easier to comprehend. * Use direct questions: ""Did you have soup for lunch?"" ""Did you have salad for lunch?"" Instead of: ""What did you have for lunch?"" The more precise you are in your language, the less difficulty the elderly have to understand. * Reduce the ""noise"" in your sentences and questions. Limit your sentences and questions to 20 words or less. Don't use slang or filler words and phrases (""like,"" ""well"" and ""you know"" are a few examples). * Avoid confusion of mixed ideas and questions. Try to define your ideas and questions logically. If you mix ideas, it may be confusing for the older adult to understand. Express one idea and message at a time. For example, ""It is a good idea to call John. He is your brother."	"She is your sister."" A more complicated construction would be: ""I think we should call your brother, John, first, and then after we could call your sister, Susan."""

Choose a vampire you could date for a very long time--like forever. Even though you aren’t talking about marriage, attraction times ten has to be there in order for you to consider dating a vampire. Dating a vampire is like dating the ultimate “bad boy” who lives by his own rules. You need to really feel the attraction in order to take a leap of faith. Several elements to consider include: * Physical appearance: although film and television vampires are undoubtedly the hottest creatures around, make sure you feel a physical attraction to your vampire before agreeing to go out for a bite. * Personality: even though he or she may be hot, you will want a vampire who has it all--charm, intellect and a sense of humor. Traits that he most likely cultivated and perfected through the dozens or hundreds of years he’s walked the earth. * Mutual interests: there’s a good chance your vampire will have something in common with you, considering he has been around for some time. Find common ground or activities you both enjoy. * Stability: is your vampire transient to avoid the townspeople from questioning his eternal youth or does the vampire like to put down roots and stay put for a while? Knowing whether he moves around a lot will help you determine if this will be a fly by night romance or something more long term. 2. Determine if the vampire wants to eat you. Folklore differentiates as to what and how a vampire eats. Modern vampire fables suggest that some vampires can feed on humans without killing or turning them into vampires, whereas other chronicles point to either immediate death or transformation the minute a vampire sinks his teeth into the victim. Either way, get your story straight and know exactly how this vampire would turn or kill you and, most importantly, if he has any interest in doing so. * Ask about his diet. Is the vampire considered to be a “vegetarian,” meaning that he or she hunts and feeds off of animals instead of humans? Some vampires may still consume human blood but through blood bank blood bags. * Inquire about what sets the vampire off. In some cases, a vampire may become overwhelmed with thirst or hunger in situations where he is aroused, angered or is overwhelmed with certain smells. Figure out what will set him off and avoid those situations like the plague. 3. Avoid bleeding in your vampire date’s presence. While your vampire date may not want to eat you, the sight of your blood may overwhelm him. At dinner, use a butter knife to cut your steak and be careful opening gifts or books to avoid getting a paper cut--possibly enough blood to send your betrothed over the edge. 4. Embrace the vampire lifestyle.	.

Complete a credit counseling session. Before you can start on a debt management plan, you need to complete an initial credit counseling session. The credit counselor will evaluate your situation, decide whether you are a good fit for debt management, and tell you what your first steps should be. * Whether you compete the counseling session online or over the phone, you need to gather all of your account information—including utility bills, credit cards, and delinquent accounts—for any revolving accounts. You’ll also need to know specifically how much you and your financial partner make each month. * Debt management programs are designed to deal chiefly with unsecured debts, so mortgage and automobile debts are usually not part of a debt management plan. However, many debt management companies may offer counseling about both types of debt, so it's good to ask. 2. Work out a debt management plan. If you’re a good fit for the program, your credit counselor will work out a debt management plan with you. They’ll give you a budget and make payment arrangements with your creditors. You’ll make one or two payments per month to the credit counseling agency, and they will apportion the payment among your creditors. 3. Track your expenses. After you start on your plan, you should immediately begin tracking your expenses. Learning where you spend your money is the first step in deciding where you can cut back. There are a number of ways to do this. * Sometimes your bank will offer sophisticated online tools to help you track expenses, many of the credit counseling agencies have online and paper expense trackers, and there are a number of financial apps that keep track of spending. * Some of the more prominent financial tracking apps are Mint, DollarBird, and Goodbudget. Look at the features of each to see which one is right for you. 4. Revise your budget. After most people have tracked their finances for a period of time, they will notice areas where they spend more than they need to.	.

Deal_With_Friends_Who_Stab_You_in_the_Back.txt	Begin_Revision	0.696	### Forgiving Your Friend	2990	"""""""But I have decided to forgive and not let that impact out friendship . """""""""""""""	### Forgiving Your Friend	3076	"""""""However , I have decided to forgive you and not let that impact out friendship . """""""""""""""	<insert><However><1>|||<replace><But><1><,><2>|||<insert><you><7>	True	Forgiving Your Friend  1. Think about the benefits of forgiveness. It can be very hard to forgive someone who has stabbed you in the back. However, there are many emotional and physical benefits that occur when you forgive someone who has wronged you. When you are consciously aware that your own well-being will actually improve when you forgive your friend, you may be more motivated to do so. Here are some of the benefits of forgiving others: * Decreased depression and lessened anxiety * Greater overall psychological well-being * Reduced levels of stress * Greater spiritual connection * Strengthened immune system * Lower blood pressure and improved heart health * Better interpersonal relationships * Increased self-esteem 2. View the situation from the other person’s perspective. Sometimes unintentional betrayal happens because of a misunderstanding. Therefore, it’s important to consider the other person’s perspective. Taking time to reflect on the intention behind the behavior from the person’s perspective can really help you begin the process of forgiving him. 3. Focus on compassion. Showing compassion when someone betrays you is difficult but it is essential to the forgiveness process. The most effective way to demonstrate compassion is to consider how the other person may actually be feeling right now. There are multiple ways that you can cultivate greater compassion: * Remind yourself that everyone is ultimately doing the best that they can. It’s helpful to keep in mind that everyone misses the mark sometimes. Think back to a time when you may have unintentionally betrayed a friend. For instance, have you ever believed gossip about a friend and overreacted? * See the individual as a person and not as “the person who stabbed you in the back.” When you see her as a person who has flaws and sometimes makes mistakes, you may be more willing to forgive her. * Look for things that you have in common with the person. Do you have similar hobbies or do you have the same parenting style? When you see yourself as being similar to a person, you tend to have more compassion for her. * If you’re spiritual, it may be helpful to rely on the religious teachings of unity and grace. 4. Make the decision to forgive. Forgiveness is making a shift in your thinking so that you no longer have the desire to seek revenge or ill will toward the person that you feel has wronged you. Keep in mind that forgiving a person is not the same thing as condoning their actions. Forgiveness is the conscious decision to release your negative thoughts toward the other person so that your own well-being can improve. Remember, you can forgive and still take action to protect yourself from future betrayal. 5. Let go of the grudge. Decide whether you want to tell the person directly that you have forgiven her or whether you’d prefer to privately release the grudge. Your decision will probably depend on the specifics of the situations and your own individual comfort level. Here are ways that you can let go of the grudge: * Call the person up or ask to meet with her in person. Tell her directly that you forgive her. You can say something like, “I was upset that you said those things behind my back.	.

Create shelving. Since your cabinets are probably stocked to the brim, you'll probably need other methods to house what's left over (the decorative doodads and the like). For this, you basically have two options: * Floating shelves. If you have walls (and you probably do), you can install floating shelves with ease. They'll also draw the eye upward, so if your kitchen is small, it will distract from the cramped-ness of the rest of the room. * Cubed shelving. This is basically turning a wall into a series of boxes. They're artistic and utilitarian. For an added touch, decorate each box (or some of the boxes) with different types of shelf paper. Tada, kitchen innovation. 2. Stick with an accent color. A kitchen doesn't need too much going on, so sticking to black and white and other neutral tones is probably your best bet.	Maybe bright yellow or bright blue? All of a sudden, the eyes aren't concerned with the size and immediately focus on your great pieces.

Talk to the bus driver. See if there's a chance the driver can stop the bus at a nearby rest stop so you can use the bathroom (other passengers will probably take advantage, too). Be careful not to distract the bus driver, though. It's important not to raise your voice or do anything that could create a dangerous situation. * It is possible that the bus driver will say no, and you'll just have to keep waiting. If it's a charter bus on a schedule the driver isn't going to be likely to want to pull over. Still, it's worth a try. * If the driver says no, ask when you'll be stopping next, so you can resume your seat at least knowing when you'll get to relieve yourself. 2. See if you can discreetly pee into a container. When it comes, it comes, so have somewhere to put it. Cover your lap with a jacket or something and pee into a container of some kind. Choose one with a lid so you can keep things as sanitary as possible and close it up when you're done. * If your seatmate is a friend, have him or her stay positioned in front of you while you use the window seat to pee discreetly into the container. * Wait for a time when the bus is running over smooth highway and not driving through city streets and running over potholes. 3. Avoid peeing in your pants. You wouldn't be reading this article if you saw peeing in your pants as a viable option, but it's worth pointing out that peeing on a bus seat is unsanitary and rude to your fellow passengers. If there's just no way you can avoid it, and you can't find a container fit to use, do your best to hold in as much as possible until the bus finally comes to a stop. 4.	If you panic, you'll attract attention to your wet pants, adding to your embarrassment. Simply stay where you are until the bus stops and wait for others to leave, then inform the driver you've had an accident. If there are still others on board who notice you peed in your pants, don't sweat it! You may never have to see them again.

Depending on the car you have, some of these procedures may need a bit of alteration to work with your specific vehicle. When in doubt, get a better vehicle. * Front-wheel-drive (FWD) vehicles are likely the most restricted. In general, FWDs tend to under-steer (washout) while in a corner when the driver is giving the vehicle gas to accelerate the car out of a turn. This is a bad thing, and greatly restricts the turning capabilities of the vehicle. * Rear-wheel-drive (RWD) cars are more efficient than FWD for cornering and acceleration, but can become a hazard with an inexperienced driver. Donuts can be fun, but not during a critical situation. * All-wheel-drive (AWD) cars have a good balance, but can also under-steer badly if it is not a vehicle with an active or manual center differential (most AWD vehicles only wish they had this feature). * Knowing the characteristic of your vehicle is key to performing in extreme situations without putting yourself and others around you in danger. Please read the How to Choose a Car for Tactical Driving article for more information. 2. Stay alert: * Whenever you are driving, you should always be aware of your surroundings. You should know what cars are around you at all times. * If you are traveling fast, and cars in front of your are slamming on their brakes, you should first attempt to slow down, but you should also be scanning the area for an exit. There isn’t always an exit, but many times there is. * Sometimes the ""exit"" is not a clean exit, and may be a what-will-cause-the-least-damage (CTLD) exit. This may consist of choosing to going off the road completely instead of just onto a shoulder. Choose the safest route before you choose the cheapest route. * Many people become observably more alert after they have recently been in an accident, don’t let that be you. You should be alert to avoid your first accident as well as others around you who may not be paying attention. 3. Braking: (the all-important skill) * Braking is a lost skill. With so many cars with anti-lock brakes (ABS), people just slam on the brakes in any situation. This can be a good option, but it is not always the best. Braking (even with ABS) can cause reduced handling capabilities and actually place you in more danger. Turning while on the brakes can cause the vehicle to neither turn as well as it could without the brakes or cause the vehicle to slowdown less than it could have without turning (read some of the maneuvers for further explanation). * Race car drivers, who are always on the edge with their vehicles, have learned the needed skill of separating braking from turning. In 90% of corners, racers (of any race type) use their brakes before they get to the corner, make the corner, then use the gas. Each section of the corner (or the straights before and after the corner) has its own purpose and separation of brakes and turning gives the best traction for the vehicle to make a desired corner. * Using your brakes (if you do not have ABS) should be done smoothly. Depress your brake pedal, do not slam it to the ground. This is a method called squeezing your brakes, and is essential to get the best braking potential from your vehicle. You bring your vehicle’s tires just to the point of breaking traction. While some people say pumping your brakes is a good way to stop, especially on low traction surfaces, it is only a reliable way to stop if you are an inexperienced driver. * This can be easily practiced in an empty parking lot. Roll down your windows and start at one end of the lot. Accelerate to a safe speed (30-40MPH should be good) and slam your brakes as hard and you can. You should hear a good deal of squealing (if you do not, you may have ABS, you may not have disc brakes, or your brakes may need replacing). Now go back the other direction and this time quickly depresses your brakes until you get the squealing again. Go back and forth until you are able to apply your brakes while only hearing a whisper of squealing (this is called the optimal squeeze point – OSP). * What is the whisper of squealing I speak of? This is the point where your tire’s rubber is being twisted and contorted to a point that only parts of your tires are actually skidding; this is the absolute limit of your tire’s traction, and the quickest way to stop. * You can measure this by setting up markers as to when to start braking and when you stop the car, and you can visually see the difference between your tires locked up and not. * Extra practice: Purposely lock up your brakes. Now practice reducing pressure on the pedal until it stops locking up, then apply pressure again to the OSP again). * Take note: each surface and speed will have different OSPs. This is why you should practice while is dry, then while it is raining, and then when it is snowy (if available). Get yourself adequately adapted to different traction levels so nothing will surprise you. * Using your brakes (if you have ABS) is much simpler. In almost all cases, just depressing your brake pedal smoothly (albeit quickly) to the floor is often best. You will likely feel the pedal either vibrate (dependant ABS) or feel like it gives out altogether (independent ABS). Either way it is a sign of the ABS working. Of course, if the pedal feels like it gave out, and you aren’t stopping, your brakes probably gave out, in which case you should just say goodbye (or read the wikiHow article, 'How to Stop a Car with No Brakes'!). 4. Swerving: (S-swerve) * We start with a very simple maneuver, but a very viable skill for normal drivers and technical drivers. This skill can save your life when you need to make a sudden direction adjustment with your car. * The scenario: Driving down the freeway, at night, it is raining so there is reduced traction and visibility on the road. You are traveling at 70MPH and about 100-feet in front of you a large box is in the middle of the road. * This gives you almost exactly one second to decide what the best choice of action it, and execute it. * Being a large box, you deduce there may be something very heavy in the box, and it can damage your car severely and put you and your passengers in danger. * Solution 1 (no cars around you): You should already know if there are cars near you (read ""Stay alert"" above). Do not touch your brakes! With only one second to react braking will only reduce the amount of traction available to your front tires, and may knock your vehicle out of balance, and thus, out of control, during the quick maneuver. * Jerking the wheel toward the desired direction is not the safest way to swerve either (for all the same reasons as braking is unsafe). A controlled swerve is always best. If you out-steer your suspension, your car will only under-steer, possibly causing you to hit the box. You should steer swiftly without being jerky. Once out of the path of the box, roll the wheel the other way to straighten your vehicle out. Again, if you do it too fast you will spin out! Using your brakes before you straighten can also cause you to spin out. Once you are out of the way of the box, you have more time to correct your car’s direction, so do not be hasty, and do not overcorrect. * In this situation, no braking is involved, and the first turn away from the box should be done faster than the correction back in to the correct direction. * Solution 2 (cars are around you): This situation is much more tricky. If you are unable to move to the lane next to you, you should determine if there is a shoulder you can use. If there is no clean exit, the CTLD exit is likely hitting the box. Use the braking techniques from above and slow down as quickly as possible. A 70MPH car is not likely to be able to stop in 100-feet, but any reduction is speed will reduce the damage done to you, your passengers, and your car. * In a non-critical (non-tactical) situation: If the box ends up being empty, and no damage is taken, be aware of cars behind you which may rear-end you because you are going slow, or are stopped in the middle of a freeway. Find a safe way to remove the box from the freeway, and continue. If the box does damage your car, be sure you and your passengers are alright. If you are able to safely get the car to the side of the road, do so. Keep it off the road, and stay in the car, the freeway is a dangerous place to be. Call (hopefully you have a cell phone) the police, and report the accident. * In a critical (tactical) situation: if your car still functions properly after hitting the box (if you are trying to get somewhere) continue your journey. If you car does not function properly, hopefully you are not being chased and your life is not threatened by this problem. * If the object were a bit further away, the best decision would probably be to use your brakes for a short period of time, release them most of the way (all the way, and the transfer of weight off your front tires may cause your vehicle to become unstable when you try to swerve, or just under-steer), then swerve. The lower your speed is during the swerve the safer the swerve will be executed. 5. Reverse 180: (simple, fun, fast getaway) * This is a maneuver, which allows you to get your car moving in the opposite direction without having to perform a u-turn. * It is usually initiated from a stopped position, and can get you turned around even in a tight location (without an 8-point turn). * For this maneuver to be executed properly, you need enough room to have the car sideways, and then some. It is best practiced in an empty parking lot or dirt area (dirt will give you the same skills, but requires less speed, and will cause less tire wear). * Assuming you are in a parking lot: Drive to one end of the lot with your backend pointed in the direction you wish to go. Accelerate in reverse to about 20-30MPH. * In a FWD car, this is next step is easy. Turn the wheel in one direction to initiate the front end sliding. Giving a bit more gas as soon as you start the turn will help a bit. As soon as the front of the vehicle starts sliding, press the brakes lightly, put the car in neutral, and be ready to put it into gear. * In a RWD car, turn the wheel in one direction to initiate the front end sliding, but at the exact same time, press the brake pedal pretty hard, do not lock up your brakes, but this helps your vehicle pivot on the rear tires. Put the car in neutral, and be ready to put it into gear. * As soon as the slide is half-way through, put the car in gear (drive) and be prepared to step on the gas. As soon as you are pointed in the direction you desire to go, hit the accelerator and make any minor adjustments to your driving angle with your steering wheel. * Remember, when you initiate the spin, you car will not go straight back, it will move somewhat in the opposite direction that you slide the front end, so be aware that your backend may hit something (give it extra room, unless you are trying to mess up the back-end). * You should practice spinning in both directions. And experiment with different amounts of gas and brakes at the outset of the slide. * If you do not put the car in neutral soon enough, or put in the car in gear (drive) too soon, you have the possibility of messing up your transmission. 6. Make a tight turn, quickly: (make a turn around a small object as quick as possible) * The tighter the turn you make, the slower it must be, but if you play your cards right, and make the turn faster than the other guy, then it might give you the edge you need. * We’ll say (for practice sake) you are going to make a tight left-hand turn around a parking lot light post (one of those tall ones with the concrete base). * When you are practicing, you should lay down cones on either side of the car to represent a street. * Approaching the turn you should get as far to the right as possible. Use your brakes as late as possible (read the braking instructions above), keep as straight as possible, because turning will make your vehicle slow down...slower. * For a 90-degree turn (or less), it is a simple matter of making the turn by going from the right, getting as close to the concrete without hitting it, then exit the turn as far to the right as possible. This gives you the straightest line possible; naturally, it is also the fastest line. * For a 90-135-degree turn, you may need a little cooperation from your vehicle. Again, approach from the right, but this time use the hand-brake (if available) to bring the back of your car around. Do not use it for too long, else you will spinout. If a hand-brake is not available (i.e.: your vehicle has a foot-base e-brake), then you will have to just take the corner a little slower, so follow the 90-degree turn instructions. * For more than a 135-degree turn, an e-brake turn is necessary. Do not slow down as much as you would have normally for the turn, instead, drive a few feet past the turn (5 or more feet). While still going at a decent speed and going straight, pull the e-brake. Once the rear tires have locked up, turn the wheel to the left. The car’s back end will spin around and point you almost in 180-degrees of your original course. Release the e-brake and drive off. * Any of these maneuvers done with a RWD or AWD vehicle should not be with any drifting style (with your back-end sliding as you accelerate). Keeping your back-end ""tidy"" is always the fastest way around the corner. If your tires are slipping under power to the point that the back-end swings out, you are giving it too much gas, and letting off the gas would actually accelerate you, or get you through the turn, faster. 7. The Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT maneuver) is a procedure which has been used by law enforcement departments around the world. Vehicles at high speed are, by laws in physics and aerodynamics, inherently less stable than at lower speeds. The rear of the vehicle is also fundamentally less stable than the front of the vehicle (especially a RWD vehicle, under acceleration). This is even true of aerodynamically designed vehicles such as NASCAR; the PIT maneuver is even used in this sport, though most NASCAR drivers only complain when they are the victims of such a technique. * Before the PIT maneuver is performed, it is assumed that Car A is approaching Car B from behind. The faster the speed (freeway speeds), the greater the advantage Car A has. * Car A attempts to put the front quarter of the car next to the rear quarter of Car B. It is usually performed while the two cars are almost touching each other. A starting distance which is too great can cause danger to Car A. * At speeds greater than 70MPH, Car B requires not much more than a good strong kiss from Car A. At speeds closer to 40MPH, Car A may need to sacrifice a bit of the front-end of the car to give a strong slam to the rear of Car B. *"	Car A will need to straighten out, as to not follow through too much and lose control. Car A then needs to slow down immediately to avoid broadsiding Car B. For two comparable cars, Car A should always be able to slow down faster than Car B, due to efficiencies of braking in a straight line.

Get up and move around. Whether you're traveling by train, plane, or automobile, long-distance travel involves a lot of sitting. When you sit, you decrease circulation in your legs – especially if you sit with your legs crossed or with one foot under you. * If you're on a plane, try to get an aisle seat so you can get up and move around more easily. * Ideally, you want to get up and stretch your legs or walk up and down the aisle once every hour or so. * While sitting, keep your feet directly in front of you or stretch them under the seat or into the aisle when you can, rather than crossing your legs. 2. Exercise your feet and ankles while seated. In addition to walking the aisle occasionally, there are exercises you can do to improve circulation in your legs and keep your feet and ankles active without moving around too much or disturbing other passengers. * Clinching and widening your toes increases blood flow to your feet, as does circling each foot clockwise and counterclockwise at the ankle. * Press hard on the floor with the balls of your feet, keeping your leg muscles active. This increases blood circulation throughout your leg. * Wear loose-fitting clothing and shoes you can slip on and off while traveling. This will enable you to stretch and move more easily. 3. Stretch and move your legs frequently. Particularly if you're traveling a long distance, make sure you take breaks to stretch your legs and keep the blood flowing. You can do stretches while seated or by standing in place beside your seat. * One exercise you can do in the aisle or while seated is to extend one leg straight out in front of you. Flex your ankle, pulling your toes towards you. Hold this position for a few seconds, then release.

Portuguese Man-of-War is the most common species found on Hawaii's beaches. The tide may bring them to the shore, so be careful of where you walk. They can be as small as a dime in size and are glossy blue and white in color, so they look camouflaged on the sand and in the water. Please do not attempt to pop their bubble nor touch them. * Stinging limu (seaweed) may be seen from June through September. * Oahu has almost a million people, so there is crime. Watch for glass on the ground in parking lots to identify high crime areas. Make sure to lock your car, regardless of where you park it. Never leave your keys anywhere in the car as it is common for people to check hiding places like the gas cap. In addition, thieves know how to defeat the locks on common rental cars faster than you can walk from the parking area to the beach, so do not ever put anything valuable in the trunk within sight of anyone else (leave it at the hotel). For extra protection, and a little comfort when it is time to leave, try putting shades up in your windows, it will deter walk-by thieves.	.

Make a list of things that scare you. Grab a notepad and paper, and set aside some time for self contemplation free from distractions. Relax, let your thoughts wander freely, think of things that scare you, and write them in your pad. You might think of a few things immediately, but if you give yourself enough time, you might come up with things you hadn't expected. * For example, you might immediately write down public speaking and introducing yourself to new people. After some deep introspection, you might realize that both are connected to being afraid of looking foolish or of being rejected. 2. Break bigger fears into smaller steps. You’ll likely come up with several simpler fears that you can attack with easy actions, like being afraid to try new foods. Others might be larger and more complex. Break those complex fears up into smaller actionable steps so they’re not so overwhelming. * For example, if you’re afraid to try eating fish, it’s relatively simple to go to a restaurant and order a grilled salmon salad.	It might seem like an overwhelming fear at first, but you can solve it using clear steps: ask someone you trust to help you learn, use training wheels, and start riding on grass before pavement.

Let go of embarrassment. Comfort zones typically involve being afraid of embarrassment or looking foolish when trying something new. Remind yourself that no one was born an expert at anything. Even those who have mastered a skill or discipline were once novices who had to take a risk. * Tell yourself, “Even Tour de France champions fell off their bikes the first time they rode. If they were determined enough to compete in and win races, I can learn how to ride 50 feet without stopping.” 2. Overcome false beliefs and irrational fears. Overcoming our fears often involves letting go of irrational assumptions that we’ve built over a long period of time. Try to distinguish between fears that have logical foundations and those that are based on irrational beliefs. * For example, you might be afraid of bears, but you shouldn’t include giving a grizzly bear a hug on your list of scary things to do. *	.

Set chip values (see Step 3 to determine what these values should be). Think of these as dollar or euro values, even if it's a money-free game. This helps keep people off of reckless betting. 2. Your blinds and ante are set as a percentage, based on the number of people left in the game, of total chips in circulation. We will cover percentages from a ten handed game to a two handed one. 3. When playing ten handed, the ante should be miniscule. So small that it is hardly felt. If there is enough money or chips in circulation, your ante should only be 0.02% (!) of the total. Nine handed, the ante should be increased to 0.04%. Eight handed, 0.1%. Seven handed, 0.2%. Six handed, 0.4%. Five handed, 0.8%. Four handed, 1.5%. Three handed, 2.5%. Two handed, 15%. 4.	Ten handed through six handed, the big blind should be twice the ante. Five handed, it is 1.5 times the ante. Four handed, it is 2%, three handed it is 3%, and when two are left, there is no blind.

Watch to see if the plant is wilting. Wilting leaves and stems may be a sign that you are underwatering your plants. Wilting leaves usually appear limp, weak, and seem to hang downward. Healthy leaves should appear crisp and firm. Ultimately, if your plant is wilting, you may need to give it more water. * While it is more likely a sign of underwatering, wilting can also be a sign of overwatering. To properly determine whether wilting indicates underwatering or overwatering, consider other factors such as soil moisture. Usually, if the soil is dry and the plant is wilting, it needs more water. 2. Check to see if the soil is damp 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) deep. As a rule, the soil for most plants should be somewhat moist about 3 to 4 inches deep (7.6 to 10 cm). This is important, as you need to make sure moisture reaches the roots of the plant. If the soil is not moist below 3 or 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm), your plant may not be getting enough water. 3. Provide 1 inch of water (2.5 cm) per week to vegetables.	If you’re in an arid climate, provide 2 inches (5 cm). In addition, if you’re in an extra hot environment, add about ½ (1.25 cm) for every 10 degrees above 60 degrees. It is okay if this water is provided artificially or through rain.

Take an even mix of general education classes as well as engineering classes in the early college years. * This will allow you to gain fundamental skills in classes like English and Mathematics, and taking entry-level engineering classes will also expose you to certain projects and an engineering background that will certainly look good on your resume for potential employers in the near future. Additionally, this will help you start to get a feel for which engineering discipline you should consider as your major if you are still undecided. 2. Research what programs and skills are required/popular in your field. * Try to learn these skills and programs on your own time if they are not taught within your engineering or general education classes. Many specific programs are not taught in school, thus having a wide variety of programs or skills mastered will certainly boost your chances of being hired. 3. Make an effort to join engineering clubs. * Most require no prior or prerequisite knowledge, thus giving you access to a myriad of engineering skills. Majority of these clubs have sponsors from multiple engineering companies where you may potentially apply, so becoming an active member of these clubs can show these sponsors that you can perform just as well for their company as you are for the club. 4. Take the time to network! * At the end of the day, it always helps to know somebody! Build relationships with upper classmates and professors as you progress through your courses.They can help with referring you for an internship/job, and professors would make exceptional references to include on resumes. 5. Go to career fairs throughout the academic year. * There are multiple times when a variety of companies are looking to hire. To ensure that you have a productive experience while meeting with potential employers, make sure your resume is updated.	If you do not have much experience on your resume, don’t worry, focus on the above steps in order to build it.

Write a comprehensive resume. Create a resume that includes your current job position, any prior work experience, your professional skills, and educational background. Your name and contact information should appear at the very top of the document. Save your resume in a number of different formats, like pdf and doc, to make it easy to email out. * It’s also helpful if you tailor your resume to any particular job ads that catch your interest. For example, if you the job ad states that they are looking for a “experienced technician,” then you can use these exact words in your job description, too. * Once you upload your resume to online job search websites, try to make a few very minor changes each day. This will keep your resume popping up in searches conducted by possible employers. * Make sure that your contact information, your email in particular, is professional. Most employers are not looking to hire “funnyface19.” 2. Write an outstanding cover letter. Most jobs will ask that you upload an introductory letter along with your resume and contact information. In your cover letter spend some time expanding on the qualifications listed on your resume. Your goal should be to have your letter express both your personality and your professional skills. 3. Apply only if you are qualified. It’s a good idea to apply quickly to any jobs that fit your interests and qualifications.	Instead, spend your energy improving your resume and deepening your online search.

What are you going to use the computer for? Homework, games, internet, email etc. 3. Look for manufacturers. Which company do you want to buy from? 4. Seek out discounts and deals. If you or your parents have a job in a company that deals with computers find out if their company gets discounts through manufacturers. Many companies get discounts through DELL, HP, Compaq, Gateway, Apple because they buy a lot of computers and software through these companies. If you are a college student or high school student, find out if there is any financial aid or programs that offer computers to students.(may not be new but you might get it for free). 5. If you are going to go out and buy one from a store make sure you have your specifications written down.(keeps the pushy sales people off of you). 6.

Rinse well with warm water and pat dry with a clean towel. 2. Put egg on your face to regulate and smooth acne prone skin. The B vitamins and zinc properties in eggs will actually combat zits and regulate your skin to its natural state. * Crack three eggs into the bowl, separating yolk from whites. You will only be applying the egg whites to your face so consider saving the yolk for a recipe. * Whisk together until whites are fully combined and then apply to a clean face. You may want to consider doing this over the sink as this mask can be messy. * Allow whites to dry for up to 20 minutes and then rinse well with soap and water.	.

Know the Rotty basics. Rottweilers believed by many people to be aggressive. These dogs are just huge and loving. Sometimes, depending on the dog, they can play very roughly. That is probably why people think they're aggressive. They can be used for fighting dogs, most aren't. Fighting dog owners are just plain mean. So if you're ready for a Rotty, then know you can't let them fight. 2. Be prepared for the food bill. Rottweilers can eat a lot more then an average dog. That's why they're so colossal! Look below for how much they should eat depending on their weight: * 10 lbs: 1 cup per day * 10-20lbs: 1 1/2- 2 1/2 cups per day. * 25-50lbs: 2 1/4- 3 3/4 cups per day. * 50-75lbs: 3 3/4- 5 cups per day. * Over 75 lbs: 5- 8 cups per day. 3. Pour water in a dogs bowl every time they run out. Because living things need water and they can't get 'too much'. So just know dogs need water regularly. 4. Make sure you're ready to walk your dog(s) everyday! If you not that kind of person, a Rottweiler is not for you! These breeds are very active so they need to be moving! 5. Think of pros and cons for this breed in your own home. Like these: * Rottys can bark very loud and A LOT! So be ready for that. * Rottys can be really loving and make you feel better. * etc. 6. Rottys are very pulchritudinous dogs. They can shed fur.	They are still beautiful. They all have a different personality. They are great guard dogs! These are the types of dogs you should get!

Use the map Hosea gave you to pick a legendary animal to hunt and go to the relative location of it as marked by the map. Once you get close enough to the animal, Arthur will draw a picture of the animal with a crown on its head. This can be seen on your own map. Once it appears, head closer to the drawing. 2. Clear the area around the legendary animal of any activity. If there are a lot of chaos or people around the animal, it will not come out. This includes in-game NPC’s asking you for help, any gang camps such as the O’Driscoll’s, or bounty hunters. Deal with all disturbances before pursuing the animal. * If your bounty in the area is too high, go to the nearest railroad station to pay it off. If this is not done, bounty hunters will keep respawning. 3. Wander around the area until a black dialogue screen pops up on the upper left. It should say “You have entered Legendary Animal Territory. Hunt this legendary animal by finding and inspecting clues.” 4. Start searching for the first two clues. At this point, you should get off of your horse and sneak around to minimize noise. There are three clues that each animal leaves behind. They could be anything from broken sticks, dead prey, or feces. When you do find a clue, inspect it, and it will prompt you to find the next one. There are two ways to search for clues. * Activate Eagle Eye by clicking the left and right sticks (LS + RS) at the same time. This feature will show the tracks of the animal, indicated by an orange line. Follow this track to lead you to an orange particle cloud, where the clue is located. Beware though, as Eagle Eye will deplete your Dead Eye core. * Use the radar on the bottom left of your screen or open your map to locate small white question marks. These indicate the location of clues as well. 5. Prepare to investigate the last clue. This is usually when the animal will appear so be prepared with your strongest weapons. Make sure you are crouched and moving slowly so the animal does not attack you or escape.	.
Herd_Cattle.txt	Begin_Revision	0.918	### Understanding Human-Cattle Interactions	4854	So to take advantage of this pressure zone , you must apply pressure from either hip or either shoulder right up to the neck .	### Understanding Human-Cattle Interactions	4927	Instead , to take advantage of this pressure zone , you must apply pressure from either hip or either shoulder right up to the neck .	<insert><Instead><1>|||<replace><So><1><,><2>	True	"Understanding Human-Cattle Interactions  1. Acknowledge how your frame of mind and behaviour will influence animal movement. All animals, including cattle, are incredibly sensitive to our attitude and our frame of mind, and will always be a mirror to what we're actually feeling, even when we don't realize it at the time. If you are excited or tense, they will also be excited and tense. If you are calm and quiet, they will also be calm and quiet. * When working with cattle, then, it is so very important to be in the right frame of mind because cattle are more likely to respond well versus if you were not in the right frame of mind. * In other words, if you are working cattle in an anything-but-calm emotional state, those animals are surely going to be anything but calm too. * You may find that you can work with cattle--and this goes for any other animal, dogs, cats, goats, horses, or even chickens--if you allow yourself to have a clear head and a calm attitude. You may find that, by putting yourself in a calm state, you will be able to think more clearly and deliberately communicate your intentions to the animals you are working with. And the animals are less likely to be confused as well. * Your behaviour has a huge influence on how even an individual cow, not to mention an entire herd, regardless of size, will perceive you. If your behaviour is such that you don't care or are holding back too much, they'll take advantage of that and not interested in doing as you ask. On the opposite spectrum, if you're too aggressive and forceful, they also won't be interested in listening to you. So, to be successful, pick the middle of the road: Be intentional in your actions, be deliberate, and be assertive, but never to the point of being aggressive and forceful. 2. Understand the difference between human instinct versus bovine instinct. Just to give you a taste, humans and cattle sit at the opposite end of the spectrum: We have humans, which are predatory animals, and cattle, which are prey animals. * Humans, as predatory animals, aren't much different from other predatory animals in how we perceive ourselves and those around us. When working with animals, not just cattle, our instincts are to: * Slow or stop animals * Want animals to face us; give us eye-contact, not turn away (because, to us this means they're ""going to run away."") * Keep pushing or push from behind, even when animals are already on their way and know where they're going. * Circle around (classic predatory behaviour), to ""cut off"" or, as already mentioned, stop or slow down animals. * To give chase because we think something is trying to run away. (This goes right back to instinctually wanting to slow or stop an animal.) * Not to back up, but rather stay put or just keep pushing forward, or even turn away. * Cows and other prey animals (horses, goats, bison, sheep, chickens, elk, buffalo, and even pigs) think differently from us. Their instincts are to: * Want to see what is pressuring them. * Move in the direction they are headed (i.e., if they want to go to that patch of woods, that's where they'll go; if they're heading straight they'll go straight). * Follow other animals. * Have very little patience. In other words, they won't wait around for long if you're trying to figure out how to move them, so they'll just keep going or doing what they were going to do in the first place, or whatever first pops in their heads. 3. Recognize the possibility that instinctual human behaviour has a significant influence on how animals are going to respond. We have to remember that, because cattle are prey animals, they are going to respond as prey animals will, and that is if they find any animal acting as a predator, regardless if it's a wolf or a man, they will act as any prey animal will and choose flight first before stopping and facing said predator as a last-ditch defence. Cattle instinctually know how to avoid predators; those that have had to live for extended periods without human contact (and there are many of such animals that exist in many parts of the world), have had to tap into those instincts to survive. * Some livestock handling methods recommend to ""act like a predator"" to successfully move cattle, but these methods may not always work, because it doesn't build trust nor give your animals the means to believe that you are not there to hurt them or cause fear. Instinctively, predatory actions induce fear into prey animals, which goes hand-in-hand with mistrust. Just like you'd want your horse to trust you enough to allow you on his back, you should want your cattle to trust that you are going to move them to some place where they feel safe, and also move them in a way that they are all going to willingly go there. * You can easily tell if your animals do not trust you and don't want to do as you are ""asking"" by the way their heads are held (high up, ears pricked, bodies tense with that ""look"" like they're ready to flee), and how they are hesitate and resistant to move. 4. Understand how cattle think and what they like to do. Going back to the second part of step 2 above, the instincts of cattle are basically from that of a one-track mind: They just want to go where they're headed, see what's pressuring them, and follow others. Going beyond that, when working closely with cattle, some extra points to realize that livestock like doing: * Livestock like to go by us; * They also like to go around us. * Cattle always like to go back the same way they came from; they prefer to go back to the last place they felt safe. 5. Familiarize yourself with how cattle move in response to pressure. Each individual animal has what is called a ""flight bubble"" or ""flight zone"", which can also be called a ""pressure zone"", though arguably the pressure zone is just slightly outside of the true flight zone. This zone is basically an invisible oval bubble surrounding the animal. Its size varies for each animal, from almost no discernible zone, to a zone that can be least in size. For example, bison typically have a larger pressure/flight zone bubble than cattle do. * This ""bubble"" is used as a means to move animals, done so in a way that it takes advantage of an animal's zone of comfort as well as point of vision. Thus, when moving an animal, you should always be where the animal can see you. * Cattle have a 330º field of vision. They don't see very well right in front of their noses and can't see directly behind them."	.

Think about the type of movie you want to make. 2. Watch movies similar to the one you are trying to make. Watch some well-directed movies and observe how the camera and sound effects have been used to lead inspiration into your film. 3. Decide if you want to create a narrative (""tell a story"") film, a documentary (showing reality) or a compilation film (putting together vintage footage and/or photos). 4. If you want a narrative, decide if you want to write a story yourself, base it from a book you read, or base it from a real life story. Don't confuse a documentary with a narrative. Narratives tell the story with characters and plots, so you can make a real life event into a narrative. Documentaries, on the other hand, are behind the scenes footage of an event or a life of someone, with real life people discussing these things, while providing information to the audience about a person or an event. 5. Decide on a theme or plot. Making a film about something you know is a good way to start. If you're excited and knowledgeable about the information or story, it will be apparent to your audience. 6. Write the script/screenplay. If you want to submit your script to a professional, the screenplay will need to be in a special formats. If you're simply filming the movie yourself you can write it like a play script. Your screenplay should detail every scene, all actions performed by the characters, the settings/locations, and when each scenes changes. 7. Make storyboards and a shot list from your script. Planning what shots you want to film will make the shoot go smoother. 8. Cast your film (Find actors). People in your community might work for screen credits in low budget films. Of course, it would be advantageous to have a well-known name starring in your movie. 9. Location scout: find a place and decide on the time to shoot it! Home movies will be relatively spontaneous, but structured films should have a schedule so your cast and crew know when and where to gather. 10. If you can't find the right location, create sets. You can use wood and paint for very simple set modifications. (If possible, using actual locations is easier. It's simpler to film in a diner than make a room look like one.) 11. Before your scheduled shoot, get (and test) your equipment. You will need a video camera and tripod, additional microphones, lighting equipment, and spare tapes/discs. 12. Pick out some costumes and makeup for your actors, if needed. 13. Film your movie. The shots you decide to take will make the difference between a ""home movie"" or a professional looking movie. Some people say to shoot multiple takes from multiple angles because it will be more interesting in the end. As a very general rule, professional filmmakers shoot each scene in a wide shot, medium shot and close up of important elements."	.

Formal does not mean you are being submissive. It means you are capable of being nice. You will be shown respect and consideration in return for your efforts to really understand how to speak Japanese well. * Avoid learning dialects (hogen/ben) if you live in Japan. It really should go without saying, but standard Japanese language, referred to as hyojungo, is what you should focus on for at least the first several years. Granted, sometimes it's impossible for you to know therefore you have no choice, but students of the English language do not begin with a regional dialect. If you end up living in Japan and learn some of the local dialect, your neighborhood friends will find it amusing and appreciate your effort to learn what is theirs.	And that's not good.

Become familiar with Hindi nouns. Nouns are words for objects, places, emotions, animals, and people. In Hindi, all nouns have a gender: masculine (M) or feminine (F). The gender of Hindi nouns is essential for proper grammar and communication, so when learning Hindi nouns, you must also learn its gender so you can use the nouns correctly. * A very general rule to determine the gender for a noun is words that end with the vowel आ aa are usually masculine and words that end with the vowel ई ee are usually feminine. But this rule does not always apply, as there are many nouns in Hindi that are exceptions to this rule. So it is essential that you learn the gender of every noun through memorization and practice, rather than rely on this general rule. * For example: The noun for boy is: लड़का larkaa (M) and the noun for girl is: लड़की larkee (F). So in the case of these nouns, the general rule of gender applies. *	.

Know that silk screens are the best way to produce a lot of identical shirts quickly. Silk screening uses a pre-made design to apply ink onto a shirt quickly. You can then remove the shirt, put another one under the screen, and apply the same design to that shirt. To silk-screen shirts, you will need some supplies, most of which should be available at your local art store: * Silk Screen ink * Photo Emulsion * Silk Screen and frame. * A squeegee * A bright light (minimum 150 Watts) * A large black, flat surface (chalkboard, poster, etc) * Poster board * Scissors or X-Exto knife * T-Shirt ink (make sure it matches your fabric) * A design * A t-shirt 2. Create a stencil of your design. Silk screen can only apply one color at a time, so create a simple shape or outline to begin learning. Your design will be what eventually is colored onto your shirt. Draw your design on piece of poster board and then cut it out. 3. Use the squeegee to coat your silk screen with photo emulsion. Photo emulsion is a special substance which reacts to light. Pour a line of emulsion along the entire side of the screen and use the squeegee to spread it along the entire screen. * Apply emulsion to the bottom of your screen -- the side that is not surrounded by the frame on all four sides. * Do this in a dark room so that the emulsion does not begin to react. * You want the thinnest coat you can get. * Let the emulsion dry in a dark space. 4. Set up your exposure area. Following the specification on the photo emulsion bottle, set up a light above your flat black surface. Each emulsion has different times, watts, and distances needed for proper exposure. *	.

Empty most of the Mountain Dew from the bottle. Drink the soda or pour it into a glass, leaving only 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.635 to 1.25 cm) left inside the bottle itself. * Warmer temperatures tend to produce a stronger reaction, so for best results, leave the Mountain Dew out at room temperature before you begin. Do not use one straight from the refrigerator. 2. Snap open a glow stick. Use sharp scissors or a sharp utility knife to open a standard size glow stick. Make sure that both compartments are open. * Work carefully with the blade so that you do not accidentally cut yourself. * As you cut open the glow stick, make sure that the fluid does not spill out onto your skin, clothes, or any other surfaces. You might want to work over a sink, bowl, or plastic mat, just to be on the safe side. * Glow sticks usually have two separate compartments. In the first, there should be a pre-mixed solution of hydrogen peroxide and a fluorescent dye. In the second, there is a chemical known as diphenyl oxalate, which triggers the reaction with hydrogen peroxide and the dye. Both must be present in the Mountain Dew to produce a glow, just as both must be present in the glow stick to make the tube glow. * For consistency's sake, try using a green glow stick instead of one in another color. 3. Add the contents of the glow stick to the Mountain Dew. Carefully pour the ingredients from both compartments into the Mountain Dew bottle, using up the entire glow stick. * Even though the Mountain Dew and glow stick fluid should produce a little glow, the fact that the glow stick fluid has now been diluted in the Mountain Dew will cause the brightness of the glow to be muted, as well. In order to produce a brighter glow, you will need to add a few more ingredients to the mix. 4. Squirt in a little dish-washing liquid. Add a good squirt of standard liquid dish soap to the contents of the Mountain Dew bottle. * Clear dish soap or green dish soap are your best options. * The dish-washing liquid can help enhance the shine and luminosity of the glowing liquid simply in the way that it reflects light. It will not be involved in the chemical reaction itself, but it can enhance the appearance. 5. Add 1 to 3 capfuls of hydrogen peroxide. You need to drop hydrogen peroxide into the Mountain Dew to help produce a stronger glow. More peroxide will cause a brighter glow, while less will cause a more subtle glow. *	As a result, the glow fluid will become less diluted and produce a brighter effect.

Look over the dog's records. You will want to look at the dog’s health records and veterinarian examination findings. If a breeder can't give you these, it's a good sign that you should walk away from the situation. 2. Spend some time with a prospective dog. Regardless of where you find that “perfect” dog, you will need to spend a minimum of two hours with it before you commit to adopting it. Play with it to gauge its personality or try taking it for a walk to see how it deals with the world. * One big issue with adult dogs is bad behaviors. You will want to make sure the dog is friendly to you, that it doesn’t have any bad habits (like biting or growling at you), and make sure you are generally comfortable with the dog. * If you are unsure after a few hours with the dog then sleep on the decision. Don't adopt the dog if you have misgivings. Instead, come back the next day and assess the dog again. 3. Assess the dog's health through its general appearance. Look at the dog closely as you play and interact with it. Check the following: * Ears: Dirty ears may indicate an infection or ear mites. There should be no redness or foul odor to the ears. * Teeth: The teeth should be clear from any tartar or calculus (brown residue sticking to the teeth starting at the gum line). In dogs over five years of age there may be a small amount of tartar on the big canine teeth and the teeth may be stained yellow.	.

Place your tiddlywinks mat on a table that is able to support it. You can play on the floor, but it's not recommended for reasons of ergonomics. 2. Assemble four players and have them choose pairs and colors. Alternatively, you can play with two players; each player will take two colors. Red and Blue always partner each other against Yellow and Green. Three players can likewise play two-against-one. 3. Place the pot in the center of the mat, and the winks of the four colors in the four corners. It doesn't matter which color takes which corner as long as their clockwise order is blue, green, red, yellow. This corresponds to their alphabetical order. 4. ""Squidge off"" to decide which player goes first. Each color plays one wink as close to the pot as they can. All winks that go off the mat are counted as equally far away, and all winks that go into the pot are equally near. In the event of a tie, only the colors that tied repeat the process. The color nearest the pot goes first. 5. Start a timer at the start of the game: 25 minutes is normal, or 20 minutes for a two-player game. Remember who plays first! They will also play last, which is another advantage. 6. Take turns, proceeding in a clockwise order. Each player gets one shot per turn, unless they pot a wink of their own color, in which case they get an extra shot. So it is possible to pot all 6 in one turn, but this can be a risky strategy. 7. Capture enemy winks. Any wink which is underneath another wink, even by a tiny margin, cannot be played. It is said to be squopped. This rule is responsible for the tactical and strategic elements of the game. 8. Adopt a strategy. There are many possible game plans, but a standard strategy is to try to build an area of friendly winks close to the pot, and to squop as many enemy winks as possible. Trying to put winks in the pot too early may end in disaster as your remaining playable winks become captured and your opponents can work their winks into the pot at leisure. 9. Keep your winks on the mat. If any winks go off the mat, they are replaced at the edge. If you send any winks of your own color off the mat, you lose your next turn. 10. Play 5 more rounds after time expires, each round ending with the color that won the squidge-off. During rounds, look to maximize your score by potting winks if possible. 11. Stop the timer (or abandon counting the rounds) if one color does pot all 6 winks. This is called a pot-out. Free any squopped winks, subject to all winks remaining at their same distance from the pot. The remaining players are then in a race to pot their winks (in turn, of course). Any squops which occur accidentally are likewise dismantled. 12. Count the points. If the game ended without a pot-out, count the points for each color: any winks in the pot are worth 3 points each. Any unsquopped winks outside the pot are worth 1 point each. Any unplayed winks still in the corner are not worth any points. 13. Score the game as follows: the person with the most points scores 4. The second person scores 2, and the third person scores 1. In the event of a tie in points, the game scores are shared equally. For example, if Red gets 6 points, and Blue and Green each get 3 points, and Yellow 1 point, the game scores are Red 4, Blue and Green 1 1/2 each (they share the 2 and 1 positions), and Yellow 0. Partnerships add their scores to give the final game score, which in this case would be 5 1/2 - 1 1/2 (Red and Blue win). 14. Score a pot-out game by assigning 4, 2, and 1 according to which color potted out first, second and third. As before, partnerships add their scores."	Hence it is possible to win 7-0 this way.

Every Spy has a deadly and accurate 6/24 Revolver (Primary), the class based Sapper (Secondary) and a deadly Knife (Melee). Fore shadowing all of this, he has an Invisibility Watch to cloak him completely, rendering him impossible to see (Secondary Fire) and a Disguise Case, useful to fooling the opposing team (Four key). 2. Understand the nature of disguising. There are several points to consider when attempting to disguise. * One of the major improvements for Spies in TF2 is the effect of movement speed on the Spy, depending on your current disguise. For example, you will slow down to a Heavy's movement speed while disguised as a Heavy. * Keep in mind that you will not speed up to a Scout's or Medic's(although the medic's speed is not much different from your speed.) * Make sure that your disguise makes some sense. You probably wouldn't find a Scout running down to your own intelligence room, just as you wouldn't find a Pyro defending in the water,or a Sniper charging the frontlines. The general idea here is that you want to blend in with the other team as much as possible, so don't do things that they wouldn't do, otherwise. Also try not to disguise as an enemy Spy because most enemies go crazy when they see a Spy, theirs or the enemy's and instantly attack them. Also, try to stay away from your team mates;when the enemy sees you close to your team mates without you shooting at them or vice versa they will get suspicious. * Remember that enemy Medics can heal you when you are disguised. Your health will match that of the person you're disguising as, so you will often appear to need a heal. Calling for a Medic while disguised can often give you an excuse to retreat into the enemy base, which is particularly useful with the Dead Ringer. * Enemy Engineer dispensers will also heal you while disguised. Level 3 dispensers restore cloak in both the vanilla watch and Dead Ringer more quickly than cloak is used, so you can stay invisible near a level 3 dispenser indefinitely. * thumb|Disguised as a Sniper.Back in Team Fortress Classic (TFC), a disguised Spy would resemble an enemy player to your teammates, which proved to be very confusing. When disguised in TF2, you will resemble a Spy wearing a ""cardboard-cutout mask"" of your chosen class, to your teammates. This will help to distinguish you from an actual enemy player. * Before the Sniper vs. Spy update, the enemy spy disguise was useless, as it didn't wear a disguise mask; disguising as a friendly player was the preferred way to approach the front lines. Now, with the update, you will disguise as a disguised spy, making an enemy spy disguise much more effective. 3. Don't hide from the battle. The Cloak and Dagger allows spies to remain cloaked indefinitely, but a good spy won't take advantage of that ability. While you're cloaked, you aren't helping your team. 4. Be deceptive and unpredictable. Players are humans, and will be more careful as you become more successful. Hide somewhere different every time, don't always camp the same place. When you are disguised and an enemy becomes suspicious and starts shooting you, the best thing to do would be to cloak and hide. This is because the Spy's revolver and knife will not do a remarkable amount of damage in head-on-head combat."	.

Check Tire Pressure  Why? Riding on under-inflated tires can cause flats and damage your wheels. And pumping up tires is a lot easier than fixing bent wheels. How? It's hard to tell with your thumb if a tire is under-inflated, especially on narrower, higher pressure tires. Instead, use a pressure gauge or a floor pump with one built-in.What if there's a problem? It's good to know how to change a tube yourself, and a lot of you reading this probably already do. But if you're not sure, have a mechanic at your local shop give you a quick lesson. Rear wheels can be a little tricky to remove and install because of the chain & derailleurs. Mechanic's Tip: Don't just throw a new tube into the tire without finding out what caused the flat - if the sharp object is still stuck in your tire, it will be happy to flat yet another tube. Safety Pointer: Under-inflated or over-inflated tires can both cause accidents, though it's more common with under-inflation. 2. Check Your Chain Lube Why? Riding with a dry chain wears the chain's moving parts out faster. This, in turn, wears out everything else on your drive train faster: cassette, chain rings, even the little pulleys on your derailleurHow? Before throwing a leg over the bike, back-pedal a half-revolution and listen for squeaking from your chain. If it's squeaky, looks dry, or even if it's just been a while since you lubed it last, take a second to apply some fresh oil to the chain.  What if there's a problem? Steady a drip bottle of chain lube so that it's just above the chain, then backpedal through three or four revolutions while gently squeezing the lube out onto the top, not the sides, of the chain. If you don't want to get messy, a local shop will usually do it for a dollar or two. They can also tell you what oil to use in your locale.  Mechanic's Tip: Every climate has its own best chain lube. Seattlites might want something not too far removed from motor oil, while we Coloradoans favor fairly thin lubricants that don't attract too much dust. But WD-40, Liquid Wrench and similar ""penetrants"" are never a good idea. Safety Pointer: Don't use aerosols, as the overspray can get on the rim and interfere with your rear brake. 3. Check Your Brakes Why? Because people with bad brakes lead shorter, more painful lives.  How? Before you start rolling, squeeze each brake a couple times to make sure they're working. Squeeze them again lightly as you start rolling to feel for uneven braking due to wheel damage, or the change in braking vibration that can mean your brakes are rubbing the tire rather than the metallic braking surface of the rim.  Mechanic's Tip: This is especially important if you frequently take the wheels off for transportation or storage -- it's common to forget to hook up the brakes again.  What if there's a problem? It may be as simple as taking up a little slack in the brake cable with a barrel adjuster or as complicated as a loose or broken part.  Safety Pointer: These are your brakes we're talking about, so if you don't know what you're doing, take it to a shop. 4. Check Your Clipless Pedals, If You Have Them Why? If you find something that interferes with disengaging your pedals, you might just save yourself from keeling over at the next stop sign. It's hard to look cool when you're on the ground with your feet stuck in your pedals.  How? As you engage the cleat and pedal, take a minute to clip out and back in again once or twice.  What if there's a problem? If it feels rough or stuck, it might be a pebble stuck in your cleat. That's easy to fix. But if it feels sloppy and loose, or feels uneven but doesn't improve with a little light oil on the retention mechanism, you might have a broken cleat or pedal. That's more likely to require a trip to the bike shop.  Mechanic's Tip: If you're riding in muddy, sandy, rocky or snowy conditions, a couple moderate sideways whacks of shoe against pedal can help you clear the interfering grit and gunk without dismounting. Safety Pointer: In my shop days, I saw more than one customer injured by falling over in clipless pedals they couldn't get out of. Don't monkey with the cleat tension unless you understand what you're doing, and give yourself a chance to get used to any changes in a safe test-ride environment. 5. Feel for Loose Parts Why? Some loose parts will cause things to wear out faster, while others can cause crashes. Either reason is good enough for me. How? As you mount and push off, feel for anything unusual. The force of your weight on the bike and the first couple pedal strokes will usually make serious problems like loose wheels, saddles, handlebars or accessories apparent with a clunking sensation.  What if there's a problem? Depends on what it is. If you can find it and fix it, great; if not, you shouldn't ride until you know what's causing any big clunk.  Mechanic's Tip: Again, people who frequently remove wheels for transportation or storage are most likely to encounter forgotten quick release levers.  Safety Pointer: Novice cyclists are often mystified by quick-release levers (if you're not certain that you're doing it right, ask someone who knows). But any significant clunking sensation means something's about to fall off or fall apart, and that's never safe. 6. Listen for Unusual Noises Why?"	Early detection means less expensive repairs and safer riding. How? As you start out on your ride, listen for unusual sounds of scraping, rattling, rubbing, or creaking. What if there's a problem? Stop and see if you can figure it out. If you can't, it might not always be necessary to scrap the ride. Little noises can be really hard to track down, and if there aren't any other symptoms, it might not require immediate attention. Mechanic's Tip: Pay attention to rhythm. Noises that start & stop with your pedaling are usually symptoms of something in the drive train or parts of the bike that bear your weight. Wheel & brake noises will get faster as the bike accelerates, and continue whether or not you're pedaling. Safety Pointer Noises relating to wheel rotation are always worth finding before you ride anywhere, since they often indicate unsafe conditions in your brakes, tires or wheels. On the other hand, creaking sounds that seem to occur when you shift your weight around on the bike can be as benign as a stem or seat post that needs lubrication, or as serious as a small crack developing somewhere important. Take it to a mechanic if the creaking gets louder or fails to go away.

Get them to put their PJ's on well before bed, so they are ready and then tell them if they want a story they need to go five minutes early, and make them use the bathroom or have a drink then. If you make a kid go to bed early and they know it, they won't be happy with you, and that means you probably won't be hired again. * You'll get further with a kind word and some crayons than you will with just a kind word. * If the weather is nice and there's a safe, enclosed area outdoors, and if it's okay with the parents, let the child run around outside. Just remember that outside play requires constant supervision. * Try and have fun with the children. Chances are, they'll have fun too! * Any good babysitter knows that if you're babysitting in the evening a bedtime story is the bee's knees.

Learn as many of the open chords and chord shapes as you can. Open chords are those that utilize unfretted, or ""open,"" notes when played. They are far and away the most common chords in bluegrass, as open notes will keep ringing out after being played, which creates wonderful sustain and lasting melody. If you're just starting, the essentials are C, G, and D, which can form hundreds of songs on their own: * C-Chord | G-Chord | D-Chord | * |e|----x-----|------3------|-----2------| * |B|----1----|------3------|-----3------| * |G|----0----|------0------|-----2------| * |D|----2----|------0------|-----0------| * |A|----3----|------2------|-----x------| * |E|----x----|------3------|-----x------| 2. Learn the ""boom & chick"" pattern most common in bluegrass rhythm guitar. This is the classic and most essential bluegrass rhythm, and can be played on any chord. Start with an open G, fingering it like normal, and count out a basic ""1, 2, 3, 4 / 1, 2, 3, 4/ etc."" rhythm. You need to get this picking pattern down pat with any chord and any speed. * Beat 1: Pluck the root note, in this case the 6th string, 3rd fret. * Beat 2: Strum the bottom 3-4 strings of the cord, coming up with the pick. * Beat 3: Pluck 4th string note of the chord, in this case the open D string. * Beat 4: Strum the bottom 3-4 strings of the chord, coming up with the pick. 3. Lay additional emphasis on the second and forth beats to really swing. This means, if playing your basic ""boom-chick,"" you're leaning a little harder on the strummed notes than the chords. This provides a regular rhythmic backbone to the song, not unlike the ""lub-DUB"" of your heartbeat. Other instruments, in general, will fill the other spaces in the rhythm with their own emphasis. * This frequently means emphasizing your upstroke while picking. A solid, strong upstroke will usually give a song a swinging feel. * Remember that tension is created through opposites."	.

Sanitize all your tools and containers * For this step simply dissolve your one step cleaner into warm water and let everything soak. The ratio for most cleaners is one tablespoon of cleaner per one gallon of water. Many of these cleaners say that there is no need to rinse after use, but I recommend rinsing anyway. After you have cleaned and rinsed everything either dry with a clean towel or let air dry. 2. Activate your yeast * This step is as simple, all you must do is take your yeast and put in a clean bowl with some of your distilled water. This is necessary because your yeast is dehydrated in its packet and works best when hydrated prior to being put with honey. 3. Choose the amount of honey. For a sweeter mead use between 3.5 and 4 pounds of honey, and for a drier mead use between 2 and 2.5 pounds. If you are not using fruit I recommend using a slightly higher amount of honey. If you are using fruit around 3 pounds of honey will be sufficient. 4. Create the initial must * The mixture of honey and water is called the must. For this step start by pouring some boiling water into a bowl and let the containers of honey sit in it. This is so that the honey becomes more fluid and pours into the fermenter better. After this, you are going to man to add some water to your fermenter. Next using your funnel pour all your honey into the fermenter. Now you are going to add one serving of your yeast nutrient and energizer. Now shake up nicely and add bits of water until honey is one hundred percent dissolved. 5. Add optional fruit or spice. * Now this is the time to adding fruit or spices. Adding fruit or spices can be a very nice addition to a mead, but it can also be very disastrous if you add too much. Just like with the honey, the more fruit you add the sweeter it can be. When using fruits 16-32 ounces of fruit should work well. Be advised when using fruits that contain pits, to make sure you remove them. You can see in the picture above that the fruit does not take up much room in most meads. * At this stage you may also choose to add some sort of spice; Peppercorns, cloves, or cinnamon work nicely. Just be advised not to use too many because spices tend to have a dominate flavor. Shake up one last time. 6. Add yeast. * Now you are going to want to grab your yeast water mixture and add this to the must. After adding it you may choose to gently shake it but is not necessary. After you add the yeast top off the container leaving 1-2 inches of headroom depending on the type of container. After this add put the stopper or lid on fermenter and add the airlock. 7. Monitor for the next 24 hours * During the next 24-72 hours watch to see if your airlock starts to bubble. I will take a few hours to get going, but once it starts you are usually good to go for the next month or so.	This means that your yeast is not doing its job and eating the sugars in the honey. When the yeast eats the sugar is then creates alcohol and CO2, causing the CO2 to bubble out the airlock.

Let the ink dry. Touching the ink before it’s dried might smudge or smear the signature. If you’re wearing the signed piece of clothing, it may be best to carefully remove it to allow the ink to dry. Set the clothing down where it won’t be disturbed until it’s dried. You can usually tell that it’s dried by looking at it in the light; if it doesn’t shine, it’s probably dry. 2. Lay your article of clothing on an ironing board. Make sure the signature is pointing upwards, towards you. You don’t have to worry about all of the clothing fitting on the ironing board, you just need to have the signature on the ironing board. * Note that you won’t be able to do this with all fabrics. Leather, for instance, can’t be ironed. You should strongly consider storing such clothing to preserve signatures rather than wearing it. 3. Use the cotton setting to iron the clothing. After letting the iron warm up, press it onto the signature. Don’t slide the iron as you usually would; this might smudge or smear the ink. Press the iron just for a few seconds, otherwise you might burn the garment. * Make sure there’s no steam coming from the iron. Water will prevent the ink from setting, and will actually help remove the signature. 4. Put the clothing in the dryer. Don’t put your signed garment in with any other clothing. Use the hottest setting and leave the clothing in the dryer for about 30 minutes. After removing it, the ink should have completely set, make it more resistant if you choose to wash the clothing. * Be aware that not all types of clothing can be put in the dryer. For these, you should strongly consider storing them rather than wearing them if you want to preserve the signatures. 5. Wash any clothing that can’t be ironed in cold water. If you’re set on wearing autographed clothing that can’t be ironed, you should only wash it in cold water; hot water can cause the ink to fade if you haven’t helped it set. * Use a coat of resolene on leather. Since you can’t iron leather or put it in the dryer, you need to take this extra step to protect the ink. All you need is to add a bit of the product to a soft sponge, then swipe the sponge along the autograph. The clear coating will help to preserve the ink. 6. Air dry any fabrics that can’t be put in the dryer.	Hang up any clothing made of these to dry after washing, making sure to keep them out of the sun.

Let yourself grieve. If you’re dealing with the loss of someone you love, then you should give yourself the time you need to grieve and come to terms with your feelings. You won’t be able to stop missing the person if you don’t give yourself the time to slow down, let your emotions out, and to feel the loss of the person who is gone. If you don’t give yourself the time to do that, then you’ll never be able to stop missing that person. * Every person’s grieving process is different. If you need to be alone for a while, make sure your friends and family members are understanding of that. However, if you spend too much time by yourself and are feeling lonely as a result, make sure to spend some time with others. * You can write in a journal, talk about your feelings aloud, go through old photos of the person you lost, or just cry. If you don’t cry, though, don’t feel guilty about it; everyone has a different way of expressing sadness. 2. Honor the person’s memory. You can honor the memory of the person you love without missing them all the time. This is a healthy way to move forward and to remember the person who is gone in a positive light. This can mean talking about the person with your friends or family members, sticking to some of the traditions the person used to love, whether it was volunteering in your community or reading to your children, or even listening to the music the person liked. * Of course, doing the things the person used to love may make you feel more sadness and longing. If that’s the case, then you need to change your routine a bit first. However, once you feel yourself beginning to move forward, you can return to doing some of the things the person loved; this will make you remember him or her in a positive light without missing the person too much. * Remember that you’re not trying to forget the person or never think of him or her again. You want to work on remembering the person in a positive light instead of longing for him or her. 3. Talk to other people who miss him. Though you may think that never mentioning the person again or getting rid of anything that reminds you of him or her is the best way to stop missing him. However, in reality, while you can do this temporarily if it hurts too much, in the long run, you’ll become more comfortable with talking about the person again. This will make your loss feel more natural, and you may find that you can even laugh about funny things the person said or did and feel less sadness about it. * Recreating fond memories of the person you lost can make you feel more at peace with the fact that the person is gone. Though you can’t bring the person back, talking about the memories that he or she gave you can help the healing process. * You don’t have to expect to find “closure” or to ever fully “move on,” but you can work on dealing with the loss in a more healthy way. 4. Know that you will never have to stop thinking about that person completely. Don’t think that when you stop missing the person, you’ll have to erase him or her from your memory forever. You can always be reminded of the great times you had or all of the memories you shared with that person without constantly wishing he or she was by your side. You also shouldn’t think that you’re somehow betraying the person by trying not to miss him or her—if the person loved you, then he or she would be happy that you’re trying to move forward. * Of course, it’ll be impossible to not miss the person completely, especially on anniversaries, holidays, or other important moments that you shared together. But you can make an effort to miss the person less. * It’s healthy to miss the person sometimes, but it’s also healthy to want to enjoy the present instead of longing for the past. 5. Spend more time with your friends and family. Your friends and family will be there to support you and lift you up during this difficult time. They may be grieving, too, and you can lean on each other and spend more time feeling loved, cared for, and even just occupied. You need love and affection more than you know during this time and spending it with the people you love will help you miss the person you’ve lost a little bit less. * Of course, you shouldn’t think that new friends or other family members can ever replace the person in your heart and can make you forget the person completely. They will never be able to do that, but they can help you deal with your grief and work to live a happier, more complete life. * Everyone reacts to losses differently. If you find that some of your friends or family members seem to be “getting over” the loss more quickly, don’t be frustrated. You don’t know what’s going on in another person’s head and you may not know how the person is really feeling. Anyway, it’s important to focus on your own feelings. 6. Consider therapy. If you want to work on not missing the person that you lost and on moving forward, then you may want to seek therapy if you feel like you just can’t do it on your own. While getting support from your loved ones and talking about your pain can be a big help, you may need the help that a professional can give. If you’re not sure if it’s for you, you can give it a try before you decide you don’t need to do it. Talking to a trained professional about your situation can give you new insight and can make you feel less self-conscious about talking about your troubles. * You shouldn’t feel ashamed or weak about wanting to try therapy. In fact, you should feel the opposite way and should be proud of yourself for seeking further help. 7. Write down your thoughts. Another way you can work on missing the person less is to write down all of the thoughts you have about the loss. Instead of having it weigh on you during all parts of the day, it can help to get some of those feelings out in a journal. You can write in it every evening to check in with yourself and to decompress, or you can write in it just when you’re having thoughts about the person you lost. Find whatever works for you and you should see that this helps you deal with your feelings of longing. * If you find that journal writing really isn’t for you, you can try going for a walk and setting some time aside for really thinking about your loss. Having this set time to be in touch with your thoughts and feelings can really be a big help. 8. Find a soothing routine. When you’ve lost someone, you may be so focused on the loss and on the person who is gone to remember that you need to take care of yourself. If you really want to be on your way to missing the person less, then you need to make sure that you’re in a routine that can help you feel better. This means getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep a night, eating three meals a day even if you don’t feel hungry, and making time for at least 30 minutes of exercise each day so you feel healthier and more together. * You may not think that eating and sleeping regularly can make a difference when you’re in the throes of grief, but it definitely can. Make a commitment to taking care of yourself while you work on missing the person you lost less and you’ll see that it’s taking effect. * Try to avoid things that tend to stress you out during this difficult time. That could mean traffic jams, loud concerts, extra responsibilities at work, or spending time with a dramatic friend.	.

Each item you shop for will allow you the opportunity to focus on her, do something for her, and then send all that love to your spouse. * Communicate via skype, email, letters and cards. * Set aside a night of the week that you and your children make arts and crafts that can be sent to your spouse. *	This will give you and your spouse something to look forward to and will give you accountability to live up to your promise.

Bluff. Bluffing involves pretending your cards are better than they are, and making aggressive bets to force out all the other players—thus winning the pot with a poor or mediocre hand. Bluffing is risky, however, since you never know when an opponent might have a strong enough hand to call you all the way to the showdown.center 2. Semi-Bluff. If you have a draw to a likely winning hand, say you have AK of spades and there are two spades on the board, you may want to bet or raise with your drawing hand. Semi-bluff tends to be a higher percentage play than a pure bluff, by giving you two ways to win the pot. Your opponents may fold, or they may call and you hit your draw on the turn or the river. 3. Slow-play your monster hands. If you flopped a monster (the nuts or at least trips), just check and call any bets to induce a bluff or let your opponents catch a card on the turn or river. Slow-playing works best with loose aggressive players that will try to bluff when no one bets. If you flopped a full house and bet out, everyone folds and you only win a small pot. So just check and let others lead out or catch a card on later streets. Be careful, though, that you don't slow play too much, especially when draws are possible against many opponents. For example, if you hold T(♥) - T(♠), and the flop comes T(♣) - 9(♦) - 3(♣), and you have three or more opponents in the pot, don't slow play here, especially if you raised preflop and are known to make continuation bets. Just bet a third of the pot to make the flush draws and straight draws pay to see the next card. 4. Check-raise. If you have a reasonable good, but not a monster, hand in early position, say top pair, top kicker after the flop, you probably have the best hand. You could bet out here, but everyone might fold and you don't win more money than what's already in the pot preflop. Alternatively, check, and hope that someone else bets. Then when it comes back to you, raise! Now your opponent bet with something like middle pair, he will likely fold here and you win an extra bet. If you get called or re-raised, you need to consider folding if facing a tight player. When you don't have a hand, the check-raise bluff works against a weak-tight player. The check-raise bluff is a high risk play, so you probably want to see the opponent fold to a raise before you attempt this ploy against him. 5. Read your opponents. Poker isn't just a game of chance—it's a game of psychology. Watch your opponents carefully for ""tells""—involuntary ticks of body language that reveal when a player if bluffing or has a good hand. Also learn your opponent's attitudes and habits. You don't want to try to bluff against someone who will call every time; on the other hand, you don't want to slow-play someone who only bets with the nuts.center 6. Juice the pot. If you have a hand you are positive is going to win, you want to get other players to bet as much as possible. To do this, don't bet too aggressively."	Don't go all-in; let your opponents go all-in.center

Pick the song you want to memorize. Obviously, it cannot be an instrumental song. It helps if it is a song you like and listen to all the time. 3. Find the song and the lyrics. By having the song on CD, iPod, or on your computer, you will quickly be able to pick up on the rhythm, which will aid you a lot when you memorize the actual lyrics. However, a sheet with the lyrics of the song is also important: this way, you know exactly what the words are, as lyrics can be hard to hear sometimes. 4. Starting from the beginning, memorize the first line. Cover it up and say it out loud. When you are done, check to see if you got it right. If you did, add the next line. If not, try again. Over time, you will be able to keep adding lines until you know the whole song. 5. Play the song with the music while you sing along and see if you have the words memorized correctly. 6. Just write down the lyrics on a notebook after listening to it a couple of times,and you should be able to memorize it better 7. Alternatively, just listen to the song repeatedly, going over the lyrics in your head as you listen. 8. Finally, try it without the words, and if you can do it, congratulations! If not then just keep on trying. You'll get there in the end! 9. Do a search for the lyrics online. Make sure that where you get the lyrics from are the same. Sometimes different websites give you different information. Try to look them up on the artists website or the play or shows website, they will be correct there. 10. After listening to the song for one time, find the lyrics on a lyrics-site such as www.songmeanings.net and print them out. 11. Go on to YouTube and see if the song is there in karaoke style. 12. Listen to the song while you are sleeping even though you aren't conscious your brain will take in the information. Before bed read over the lyrics a few times before reading a book or watching TV. Do not use earphones when sleeping, because the cord could tangle around your neck and you could choke. 13.	.

Pay attention to the name. The best way to learn a person's name is to really pay attention. When you're meeting someone, you may get caught up in the moment and not pay as much attention to the person's name as you should. Therefore, it's important to make sure the person's name actually enters your brain, instead of going in one ear and out the other. * If you realize a person's name flew by you, ask for it again. Most people are very understanding and will repeat their name for you. 2. Repeat the person's name.	"One way you can repeat the person's name is to say, ""Hello, Robert, nice to meet you."" Repeating it helps solidify it in your brain because you've both heard and said it."

It will increase your photo quality and your marketability. 2. Practice a variety of shots and techniques. When you’re selling photos, you have to consider what the customer wants. It’s best to learn a variety of photo shots and techniques so you have a wide range of products to sell. Plus, practicing will improve your photography skills! 3. Look at stock photo sites to see what kinds of photos are popular. Selfies, pictures of your friends, and other everyday photos probably won’t sell as well as pictures of landscapes or still lifes. Spend some time looking at stock photo sites to see the kinds of pictures they buy. 4. Ask any people in your pictures to sign a model release. If your pictures show anybody’s face, you’ll need to have them sign a model release before you can sell a picture of them. You can download model release forms online, or write up your own. * A standard model release simply gives the photographer permission to sell or distribute the photo, and clarifies what kind of payment the model will get. You can pay your models a flat fee or a percentage of the photo’s future earnings. Some models, especially friends or family, will pose for free. 5. Make sure you own the copyright for your pictures. If you’re selling pictures you took yourself, you automatically own the copyright and you don’t need to register or file anything. But if you are using an existing image, you need to make sure you are allowed to use it. This applies even if you are Photoshopping or otherwise altering an image. *	.

Determine if you are sensitive to certain sounds. Any sound can potentially be disturbing to a person with misophonia. Usually, these are sounds that other people don’t even notice or find casually annoying. They are also often sounds that other people make, such as tapping on a table or desk, clicking a pen, chewing food, or lip smacking. * If you are overly sensitive to certain sounds, then you may have misophonia. 2. Interpret your reaction to these sounds. The main difference between someone who suffers from misophonia and someone who has developed another kind of sound sensitivity is the person’s reaction to the sound. Typically, a person with misophonia becomes incensed and completely enraged, often screaming and crying when they encounter these sounds, or struggling with great difficulty to contain their emotions. Ask yourself the following questions: * Do you feel fear, panic, terror, anger, or like you are being caged when you hear the sound? * Do you want to yell at the source to stop or be quiet? * Does the noise cause you to think or act aggressively (fight response)? * Do you feel the need to get away from the source of the sound (flight response)? 3. Determine if your reaction is misophonia or simply annoyance. Reactions to trigger sounds can vary in intensity level for people with misophonia.	.

Shower every day. Use exfoliating shower gel to clean off the grime. Turn the water to hot to start the shower (because it cleans you more effectively), but towards the end of your shower, turn the water to a lukewarm or cool setting. This lowers your body temperature to make you feel cooler (and wakes you right up in the morning!). 2. Moisturize right after you step out of the shower. A great trick is to use baby oil instead of the normal lotions.	It's light and it lasts. If you prefer scented lotions, use something light and scented with citrus or flowers for a nice crisp scent. Heavy scents like Vanilla or Coconut can make you feel warm. Bath and Body works has lots of nice scents (Sweet Pea and Cucumber Melon are ideal for summer), and they usually have coupons and sales.

Complementary colours blend very well with each other. 3. Select curtains whose colour shade is different from that of the wall. If the wall has a dark shade, select curtains with a lighter shade.

Ensure that your wood has not been chemically treated. Chemically treated lumber (the most common form of this treatment is pressure treating) contains high levels of arsenic, chromium, and copper and is not suitable for composting. * Pressure-treated lumber can be identified through the characteristic green tint of the treating compound. If your wood has been painted or you can otherwise not clearly identify this tinting, cut into a piece and examine the cross section. Pressure-treated wood will have a very distinct ring of green color that penetrates only about a half an inch (1 cm) into the wood (soft woods only. * When you are working with both treated and untreated wood, take care to keep the sawdust from the 2 types separated when you plan to compost the untreated sawdust. This is best done by working with the untreated lumber first and sweeping up the sawdust before cutting any treated lumber. 2. Measure the amount of sawdust you have. Sawdust is a carbon-rich or ""brown"" composting material, and therefore it will need to be paired with nitrogen-rich or ""green"" materials. Combining browns to greens in about a 4 to 1 ratio by volume will yield the ideal setting for decomposition; this ratio can be altered as necessary of course. * Most organic materials that are still living or close to their living state are considered ""green"" materials. Examples of these materials include food scraps, fresh grass clipping, coffee grounds, and tea leaves. * As an example, if you have around 8 liters of sawdust, you will want to add it to your compost pile along with about 2 liters of nitrogen-rich material. An easy way to quickly gather nitrogen-rich material is to cut your lawn and use the clippings. 3. Add the sawdust to your compost pile. Once you have prepared both the sawdust and the green material to go along with it, both can be added directly to your compost pile. * Ideally, the outermost layer of your compost pile should be completely composed of carbon-rich materials (like sawdust). To achieve this, you can add the green materials and then spread sawdust on top of them. 4. Adjust the moisture level of the compost pile. The beneficial microorganisms that aid in decomposition need moisture to proceed, and it is a good idea to check the moisture content of your compost pile any time you add new materials. Ideally, a handful of compost should feel like a wrung-out sponge. Adding water after introducing sawdust is especially important for 2 reasons. * The first reason is that sawdust is hygroscopic, meaning that it will tend to absorb a high amount of water. If it is added dry to a compost pile, it will pull moisture away from your existing compost and dry those materials out. * The second reason is that sawdust poses the risk of flying away in windy weather. This risk can be mitigated by dampening the sawdust with water. 5. Keep the compost pile thoroughly aerated. Aeration is important in any compost pile, as aerobic bacteria need a continual supply of oxygen to break down your compost. This task becomes especially important when adding large amounts of sawdust to your compost pile. *"	.

Purchase a serrated knife sharpening tool. Serrated knives need different sharpeners than straight-edged blades. A serrated knife sharpener is a rod-shaped tool, usually with a taper to accommodate different sized serrations. The most effective material for a sharpening tool's construction is ceramic. 2. Locate the side of your knife with a beveled edge. Serrated knives generally do not look the same from both sides. On 1 side, the face of the blade will continue at the same angle until the blade's edge. On the other, the face of the blade will angle down slightly just before the serrated edge; this is called the bevel. Only apply a sharpening tool to the beveled edge. 3. Place the sharpening rod in one of the serrated grooves (also called a ""gullet""), keeping the rod at a very shallow angle in relation to the beveled edge. If your sharpening rod is tapered, locate the rod in the gullet so that they are the same diameter. 4. Sharpen each gullet. Using short strokes, and always stroking away from the blade (for safety's sake), run the sharpening rod along each groove. A few strokes should suffice. After sharpening each groove, run your fingers along the backside of the groove to check for a ""burr,"" or metal shavings."	.

Stop being a people pleaser. If you constantly smile in order to be polite and agreeable, you're tightly controlling your countenance and not giving your Duchenne smile much of a chance to shine through. Plus, if you're focused on everyone else's happiness, you're neglecting your own. A real smile arises from your own personal joy, not someone else's. People with martyr syndrome will often say that they derive their greatest personal joy from helping others, and sometimes this is true, but other times, it's an easy way to justify their self-sacrifice and avoid stepping out of their comfort zone.

Stop distorted thoughts of following: do not use another person's goals and ambitions. Seek liberty for yourself and other people, or if you received life by a drawing, by chance, then would your life be expendable and probably lacking value? 2. Lead to help realize your own dreams by pursuing them. It’s not too late to dream big. * Dreams can be started fresh -- or can be renovated. 3. Decide to explore new opportunities and your possibilities. * Whatever your calling in life, age or situation, there are unrealized possibilities that you can form from new dreams and plans to be lived-out. 4. Develop leadership skills, by valuing and supporting individual life and actions as personal opportunities. So, you can then appreciate your unique, personal value, and your fulfillment which centers upon finding opportunity for yourself and others to live fully by ones own plans based on a set of goals and ambitions. * Avoid being expendable by being different, not droning on the same as others. That means work-out your dreams, and goals. 5. Seek freedom defined as: 1. Freed ""to"" act (and not freed ""from"" actions), example: ""have freedom to believe in and seek your goals""; 2. Freed ""for"" a cause (and not freed ""of"" responsibility), example: ""use freedom and make the effort to create your success or failure, by trying, striving for your goals such as betterment for you and others""; 3. Seek your own individual vision that fits your ambition and your own industriousness, example: ""Take hold of freedom to decide with the freedom of choosing your own way."" 6. Be competitive in personal and group efforts for success versus mediocrity as your decision without being condemned or restricted. Consider retiring later, if you wish, be productive longer; seek to compete and fulfill visions of personal self-fulfillment. * It is not too late, example: Colonel Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), was 62 years of age when he sold his first KFC franchise (he had worked for over 30 in his own, small chicken place). He sold KFC for millions of dollars at age 74, AND lived to be 90! * Break from family and friends ways, if they have failed to show you better ways and have even dragged your ideas down until now. You may have been discouraged from dreaming; or acting in your own upward mobility and expecting that for your family: some may be accused of acting like you are better than others of your people. * Move-on, in upward mobility. If some resent the fact that you now want to move up or to do something significant with your life, so what."	.

Always trim the jib first! 2. Try to get the telltales on both sides pointing aft. When they're ""flying"" that means the air is flowing over the sail efficiently. The reason behind this lies in Bernoulli's principle. When air flows over the top of an airfoil (the sail's curve) it travels faster than the air traveling over the flat surface (the imaginary line from the front tip to the back tip of the sail). The faster flowing air has less pressure which generates lift, this lift actually pulls the boat when going upwind. More lift equals more speed. Your sail trim is most efficient when all telltales are streaming aft. 3. After trimming the jib, it's time to trim the mainsail."	.

Is anyone mean to you? All goody-goodies get ""that"" treatment from those modern, ""cool"" divas in their class - you know, they sometimes say stuff to your face, mostly behind your back. Usually goody-goodies run away crying, but normal people would blink away their tears and shoot back a cool comeback. Still, make sure your comebacks are polite and non-offensive, but are still sassy and enough to shut them up. Add some cool-cat actions to add the awesomeness to your comebacks. * Roll your head and put your hand behind your neck like you're stretching, then say to them ""If you're waiting for me to care, you better pack a lunch. It's going to take a while..."" then put your head to the side, smile at them and walk away. * Raise your eyebrows and say to them ""When you try to bring me down, that really means you think I'm above you. Well, thanks for telling the truth!"" or ""Well, thanks for the compliment!"" for a kinder version, then smile at them. * Put your hand on your hip, give them a pitying smile and say to them ""If making me feel bad was a school subject, you would fail it. I don't really care what you think of me!"" and you can add ""so you can stop studying now..."" then give them a nice smile like you never done anything. * Turn your head (use this time to blink away your tears) and laugh realistically, then turn back round so you're facing them, make a serious face and say to them ""Wait...was that supposed to be nasty?"" while raising your eyebrows. * Put 3 fingers up and say to them in a very serious and very exasperated voice ""3 words: I. Don't. Care!"" then fold your arms and sigh like you're exasperated with them, then walk away. If they say another snarky remark about you caring, just walk away saying ""Does it look like I care?"" or ""I still don't care!"" like a boss. 2. Flirt cutely, shyly and playfully, but not in an obvious way. While most of the ""cool"" girls would try to flirt with boys by making their skirt only half-of-their-thigh-length and then practically cuddle into them while sitting next to them at lunchtime. Of course you could shorten your skirt just a little, but snuggling into boys is out of the question! Even though it's not obvious, still make your little flirting cute, shy and playful. Boys love that. * Smile your adorable smile at everyone 24/7! That's right, not just at the boys - at the teachers, shopkeepers, family, people in the street...even your enemies! Practise smiling in the mirror. Make sure your lips are glossed, slightly plump and a little pursed up, but don't forget to flash your pearly whites. Whiten them (more on that later) and smile, smile, smile! * Widen your pretty eyes and smile with your eyes! Raise your eyebrows a little bit, but not too much so they disappear. Make sure your eyelashes are nice and long - don't use mascara, but use an eyelash comb, and also comb your eyebrows! Don't wear any eye-makeup at all, or your eyes won't look pretty. When you're looking down at your lunch, look up slowly...through your lashes! It looks so cute and flirty. * Twirl your gorgeous locks. Do it slowly, shyly and coyly. Smile your adorable smile while twirling. It takes a lot of practise to do it perfectly - not years, mind you, but lots and lots of days. Make sure you twirl the lock of hair closest to your face (the lock that brushes against your chest if you have long hair) with your index finger. It looks ultra-cute with an adorable bow. * Show those divas that wearing a really really short skirt, covering your face with makeup and practically snuggling into boys ain't the way to flirt! It ain't pretty, charming or talented...it's just showing off! But, of course, shortening your skirt a little is harmless, just not too much or you'll look slutty. 3. One of the most helpful things to stop being a goody-goody is being breathtakingly beautiful, absolutely perfect in boys' eyes...not everyone is born beautiful but it can work. You don't need to go on an extreme diet till you get anorexia or ruin your skin with makeup. Just look after yourself till you become a blooming beauty! * You want to lose weight? First step, cut back on sugar and starches, such as fizzy sweets and bread, respectively. Eat your 5-a-day - even 10-a-day if you eat 5 fruits and 5 vegetables. More tips are at http://authoritynutrition.com/how-to-lose-weight-as-fast-as-possible/ but there are some cons about this method. * Brush your teeth for 2 minutes (use a timer or alarm) every morning after your breakfast and every evening before you go to bed, with minty-fresh, tartar control, extra-brightening, mouthwash-strength, cavity-fighting, gel toothpaste and a trusty toothbrush. If you can floss, floss your teeth every morning and night. * Wash your face every morning with a daytime facial moisturizer and maybe a wipe, then wash your face with an (optional) nighttime facial moisturizer. In your bath/shower, wash your face properly using T-Zone Pore Cleansing Deep Wash, which helps your spots a lot. * Take multi-vitamins, zinc supplements and any other medicines. It sounds little, but those vitamins take serious, good effects on your health and that affects your beauty, so take your medicines and supplements so you look healthy and beautiful! 4. Be good and kind, but not a goody-goody doormat. Don't say yes to everything, even if someone just asks you to pick up something that's close to you on the floor. Don't wave your hand in class and always answer, but answer if you seriously know that you have the solution. If the teacher tells the class to be quiet, don't sit up with your arms folded like the goody-goodies, but sit with good posture, not all slumped. * If someone asks you to do something (even if it's little) say ""I'm doing something right now, sorry!"" then continue what you're doing or act like you're doing something then smile an apologetic smile at them while they do whatever they wanted you to do with them/for them. * If you know the answer, put your hand up with your index finger up, not your whole hand. Don't stretch your hand right up like you're doing stretches, just bend your elbow a little and relax your arm. Try not to put your hand up all the time or you'll look like a goody-goody know-it-all. *"	Don't fold your arms unless the teacher tells you too, just sit with your hands on the desk. Try to sit elegantly with good posture - don't slouch, but don't sit stiff like a fancy doll.

Write_a_Business_Contract.txt	Begin_Revision	0.918	### Writing the Contract	2145	Also , ADR is a private proceeding , which is good for businesses that do not want to hurt their reputation in public litigation .	### Writing the Contract	2224	In addition , ADR is a private proceeding , which is good for businesses that do not want to hurt their reputation in public litigation .	<insert><In><1>|||<replace><Also><1><addition><2>	True	"Writing the Contract  1. Begin with the basic information. Write the date at the top of the page, then write the names or company names of both parties in this format: ""This contract is between ___ and ___."" If there is identifying information you want to include, such as a title or business designation, include it here. If you are contracting on behalf of a business, include both the business name as well as the names of the people who are authorized to contract on behalf of the business. This would include names of the CEO, President or Director. 2. Detail the exchange of items. In clear, readable language describe what services or goods are being exchanged. For example, write ""Business A agrees to provide 100 sweaters per month to Business B. Business A will charge $20 dollars per sweater for a total of $2,000 to be paid in full by business B within 30 days of delivery."" * Use plain language, rather than legalese. If you end up going to court, the judge will adjudicate the case on how the contract would be interpreted by the average person. * Use concise language. It should explain what one business is offering and promising to deliver and what the other business agrees to pay or do in exchange. State exactly what is being sold. * If payments are to be made, include acceptable means of making payments (cash, check, or credit card, for example) as well as the amounts that will be due and due dates. * If your business is selling property, provide a legal description of the property and its exact location. The description pinpoints the location of the subject property within its particular Township, Range and Section. To find the legal description of a property, go to the records office in the town the property is located. The clerk of the records office can look up the legal description based on the address. Additionally, you can look on your property deed to see if it includes the legal description (some deeds do and some do not). * When selling goods or services, describe them in detail. Describe the color, size, make, model, delivery date and any other identifying details. If services are in consideration, say what services will be performed. Specify who will perform the services, for whom, where, when, for how long and for how much money. 3. Consider adding a confidentiality clause. If you don't want the other party to share the information in the contract with others, you can add a confidentiality clause. All businesses have some important confidential information, be it a sales plan, a recipe, or the company's marketing strategy. Companies often insert a confidentiality clause into an employment contract if the employee will deal with sensitive information. This type of clause is not necessary when the other party to the contract will not be exposed to any secret information. * The basic principles of a confidentiality clause are like those of non-disclosure agreements. * You may also want to include a non-compete clause, which would prohibit someone from engaging in a similar service for a competitor for a given period of time (such as 1 year) after termination of employment. * A confidentiality clause can be worded the following way: “The parties acknowledge that each may receive or have access to confidential information. For the purposes of this agreement, the party that receives the confidential information will not reveal this information to anyone for any reason.” 4. Add dispute resolution terms to the contract. The contract should specify how the issue will be handled if a breach occurs. Note who will pay attorney's fees and court costs, and what the remedy for breach is. Also note the state or district in which disputes will be settled, particularly if the parties to the contract reside or are licensed in different states. * If a party to the contract breaches and lawyers get involved, it is usually customary for each party to pay their own legal fees. However, parties can require the losing side in a legal dispute to pay the winner's attorney’s fees. To include a provision for payment of attorneys fees, including language such as: “The winning party has the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs and attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing this Agreement.” * If the contract is for a small business, consider adding an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) clause. Alternative dispute resolution is a term for the methods of settling a legal dispute short of litigation. ADR is usually faster, simpler, more efficient and more flexible than litigation."	Types of ADR include mediation, arbitration, and negotiation. In mediation proceedings, a neutral third party helps the contracting parties talk through their dispute and find a compromise. Arbitration is more like a trial, but outside the court system. An “arbitrator” hears evidence from both sides and then makes a binding decision. In negotiation, the parties resolve the dispute themselves, possibly with attorneys.

Explain regular business/work absences with consideration for the reasons. If the absence is predictable and regular, for example, business trips, tell your child when the other parent is coming back by showing them a calendar and talking it over with them. Make it a point of open family discussion to discuss regular travel, so that it becomes a normal expectation within the family and all members do not feel it reflects upon them and can plan for impacts such as special sports, awards and celebratory occasions well in advance. 2. Explain sudden absences according to what has happened and the age of your child.  * If it is a business trip out of the blue, it is a good idea to explain to your child that sometimes mommy or daddy need to travel for work and that they won't be gone for long. Have the other parent promise to bring back a toy/souvenir or a special photo or memory. * If the absence is unpredictable (say, for instance, that a parent is in the hospital after an accident), explain what has happened, give a generous estimate of when mommy or daddy will be back and tell your child that whilst you are not sure exactly when the parent will be back, you think it'll be by X or Y date/day. Keep your child updated on progress and changes to the dates.Discuss sudden absence according to need. 3. Explain military absence according to the advice that your deployment officers provide. Some additional ideas include: * Be as honest as the age group permits. A toddler only needs to know that daddy will be back by Christmas; a teenager will need to know the truth about the length of time of deployment and where. * Reassure toddlers who are ""egocentric"" in their world view; the longer the absence, the more a toddler might feel he or she did something wrong. Allay this by being very clear that the absence is to do with work. 4. Spend extra time with your child during other parental absence and try to cover some of the things the other parent might have done, for example, read a book but do not try to replace the other parent. Keep your own style and be thoughtful about telling your child that some activities are those reserved for your son or daughter and the other parent, to keep those things special and to ensure retention of the sacredness of their bonding. 5. Be honest if the absence is forever."	"For example: ""Daddy loves you but was unhappy with his life, he's gone to live in Vegas. We'll do our best to keep in touch but it will be hard sometimes. I can give you his address if you'd like to write/call to see how he is doing."""

Mute all kinds of background noise, such as television, music, a crying baby, etc. Being able to concentrate as intently as possible will facilitate flavor detection. 2. Clear your palate. This means that your mouth should not contain residual flavors from a previous meal. Eat a wedge of apple or piece of bread if necessary. This is crucial because we want to taste the subtleties of chocolate's complex flavor. 3. Make sure that the piece of chocolate is large enough to accommodate full evolution of the flavor profile. A piece too small may not allow you to detect every subtle nuance as the chocolate slowly melts. The important thing to remember is that flavor notes gradually evolve and unfold on the tongue rather than open up in one large package. So remember, don't think small here. 10g should be a minimum starting point. 4. Allow the chocolate to rest at room temperature before tasting. Why? Cold temperatures will hinder your ability to detect the flavor. Sometimes it is advised to even rub the chocolate briefly between your fingers to coax the flavor. This procedure is optional. 5. Look at the chocolate. The surface should be free of blemishes, such as white marks (called bloom). Observe the color and manufacturer's job at molding and tempering. Does the chocolate appear to have been crafted carefully or slovenly? The bar should have a radiant sheen. Chocolate comes in a multifarious brown rainbow with various tints, such as pinks, purples, reds, and oranges. What do you see? 6. Smell the chocolate. The aroma can be a precursor to flavor but sometimes it's not. Inhaling the fragrance will prime the tongue for the incoming chocolate. It also allows the nose a chance to pick up the various nuances of the aroma. After all, taste and smell are closely linked by nearly 80%. 7. Break the piece in half. It should resonate with a resounding ""SNAP!"" and exhibit a fine gradient along the broken edge. This is quality stuff! 8. Place the chocolate on the tongue and allow it to arrive at body temperature. Let it melt. This step is crucial, for it allows the cocoa butter to distribute evenly in the mouth, which therefore mutes any astringencies or bitterness of the chocolate. Biting will release these volatile components and cause displeasure. 9. Observe the taste and texture. As the chocolate melts, concentrate on the flavors that are enveloping the tongue. Close your eyes, take notes, enjoy this moment of bliss and bask in complacency. Revisit when the time comes. 10. Chew if you so desire."	After all, we're tasting and not eating!

Depending on your computer type, these instructions for installation may vary so read closely. 3. Open the program. You'll see that there is a set of three axes provided immediately, so that you get the 3D feel at the outset. Have a look at the tools available. There is a Line tool, a Circle tool and a Polygon tool. Each of these presents you with a variety of possible options to create your desired shapes. 4. Get to know a few basics to help you navigate around the program: * The first thing you have to know about Google SketchUp is that it has 10 simple tools that are all useful for making a model. The first group of tools are the orbit, pan, and zoom tools. These are used for you to move around and get different views of your subject and are briefly explained in this overview article. * To move the whole viewing screen, push the centre mouse button and hold down the Shift key on your keyboard. * To delete, click the arrow button on the toolbar; when something is selected to delete it will turn blue. Hit the delete key on your keyboard. * To save something, click on ""file"" (in the upper left corner) then click on ""Save As"". Choose where to save the file. Type the name of your file and click on Save. The file will be saved as a .SKP file 5. Draw some lines. The line tool is selected by default when you first open SketchUp. Obviously, this is for drawing lines. Give it a try to see what you can create and just to get a feel for the lines but be aware they're one dimensional so you won't be able to snap to axes, etc. * See How to be precise when using SketchUp. 6. Draw some shapes. Beyond lines, you can draw two dimensional shapes using the tools for shapes. Draw some rectangles, circles and polygons just to try them out. All you need to do is to click on the corresponding tool. * Given that you're working with a 3D program, you'll find that the 2D figure is horizontal."	.

This can often cause related symptoms such as a dry mouth or a dry tongue. 2. Monitor your urine color. Check the toilet bowl after you pee. Your urine color can be an indication of health. Urine could be pale, straw colored, or light yellow. Darker urine may indicate dehydration. * Urine that's somewhat dark yellow indicates you're mildly dehydrated and should drink some water soon. * When urine becomes amber colored or brown, this can indicate severe dehydration. You need to start drinking water right away and contact a doctor if the problem persists. 3. Tune in to your emotions. Dehydration can cause changes in mood. You may feel confused, frustrated, or angry. If you notice that your mood seems off, then this could indicate dehydration if you also notice physical symptoms. * You may notice you're irritable and struggling to concentrate with daily tasks if you're dehydrated. You also may be quick to anger. 4. Note changes in vision. If your vision is becoming blurry, this can be a sign of dehydration. Your eyes will also begin to feel dry, which can lead to pain or irritation in the eyes. 5. Pay attention to any pain.	Headaches and muscle cramps are common symptoms of dehydration.

Treat_Epstein_Barr_Virus_(EBV).txt	Begin_Revision	0.943	### Considering Your Treatment Options	2194	Although , keep in mind that antiviral therapy is generally ineffective for less serious cases of the disease .	### Considering Your Treatment Options	2258	However , keep in mind that antiviral therapy is generally ineffective for less serious cases of the disease .	<replace><Although><1><However><1>	True	Considering Your Treatment Options  1. Treat symptoms if they are significant. There is no standard medical treatment for EBV because it often doesn't cause symptoms, and even mononucleosis is self-limiting and tends to go away within a few months. However, if your symptoms are causing significant discomfort, then acetaminophen (Tylenol) and anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, naproxen) can be used to treat high fevers, inflamed lymph nodes and throat pain. For severe throat swelling, you doctor may prescribe a short course of steroidal-type drugs. Bed rest isn't often recommended, although some people with mononucleosis often feel exhausted. In fact, EBV may be a cause of so-called chronic fatigue syndrome in some cases. * Keep in mind that many over-the-counter medications for adults are not recommended in children (aspirin and ibuprofen, in particular). * In up to 1/2 of mononucleosis cases the spleen becomes swollen due to filtering all the abnormal blood cells out of the blood. Avoid excessive activity and any trauma to the abdomen if your spleen is inflamed (the area below your heart). * Rare complications related to EBV include brain inflammation (encephalitis or meningitis), lymphoma and some other cancers. 2. Consider colloidal silver. Colloidal silver is a liquid preparation containing small atomic clusters of electrically charged silver. The medical literature shows numerous viruses successfully treated w/ silver solutions, but efficacy depends on: size (particles should be less than 10nm in diameter) and purity (no salts or protein in the solution). Subnanometer-sized silver particles become highly electrically charged and can destroy the most rapidly mutating viral pathogens. However, it's unknown if and how silver particles specifically destroy the EBV, so more research is currently needed before any definitive recommendations can be made. * Silver solutions are generally considered non-toxic even in high concentrations, but protein-based ones increase risk of argyria — discoloration due to the silver compounds getting trapped within the skin. * Colloidal silver products are widely available in health and supplements stores, but learning to make it at home is typically the safest and most cost-effective strategy. 3. Consult with your doctor if your infection is chronic. If your EBV infection or mononucleosis persists for many months, then ask your doctor about the effectiveness of antivirals or other potent medications. Chronic EBV infection is not common, but when it persists for many months it has a significantly negative impact on the immune system and quality of life.
