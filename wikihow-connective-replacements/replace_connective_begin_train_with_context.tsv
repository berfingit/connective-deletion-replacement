Nobody gets embarrassed about buying toilet paper, even though everyone uses it while their pants are down. Every other person on average uses feminine products. * The cashiers handle customers who buy feminine products all day long. They're used to it and they've seen it a million times - to them it's just another regular customer. If they're women, they're probably using the very same products. * If you are really embarrassed about buying feminine products, use a self-checkout. A lot of grocery stores have them. * If it makes you extremely self conscious, you can always order them online. * Look into reusable products, like cloth pads and menstrual cups. Generally you have to order these online in the privacy of your home. Also you need to restock less often; one cup lasts for about ten years, and a couple pads can be used a hundred or so times.

If you do, the officer could react by arresting you or retaliating in some other way. * A police officer cannot pull you over because of your age, race or the type of car you drive.

First you need to realize what you are getting yourself into by auditioning for a play or film. This is a huge time commitment you may be subjecting yourself to, so if you work full time, have other major projects, or have a family to take care of then this may not be the best time to pursue a role in a production.	Also, it takes loads of time outside of rehearsal to memorize plays, monologues, and stage directions so be prepared for some work outside of rehearsal. Also be aware of play types. We all knowthere are dramas and there are comedies, but within those there are classics such as Shakespeare, Chekov, and the Greek Playwrigths, and they at times have very complicated language structure and very, very long passages of text. But don't be frightened, it'll eventually get easier once the director gets involved and you've had time to go over the play. And lastly, make sure you are a team player. Other actors don't take kindly to people who come in and automatically think they are the star. Especially in things like community or university theatre, there is no room to think you are better than anyone else there. It is to be a fun learning experience, and since no one is being paid (much at least) to be there no one really owes you anything, even if you do get the lead role. So with all that, on to what you need to prepare for the audition.

Take time to meditate on the Word, look for understanding and try to apply it to your life. * Praying does not mean you have to spend 30 minutes talking to God. You don't have to be wordy. You don't have to kneel, fold your hands, or even close your eyes. You can pray standing up or on your knees with your eyes and hands lifted to heaven. That prayer is only two words reaped several times, ""Fill me"". It's simple, but God understands that it means, ""Fill me with your spirit, your joy, your love for others."" * Worship doesn't have to be only at church. You can worship anywhere, even in the car on the way to school. Get a group of good Christian friends together if you can and take the time to worship. Remember, worship should occasionally be only between you and God, with no one else around. 2. Stay close with your family. Get along with your parents; take time with each of them. Having a healthy relationship with your parents is always a good thing. Also talk to your parents about God; they can help your faith if they are Christian too."	.

For example, if you live in an apartment, a Golden Retriever would cause trouble, and a Chihuahua instead would be better. Then go to the local shelter to find your puppy. Or, if you'd rather, go to the pet shop. However, the dogs there have a chance of originating from illegal puppy mills. Never be fibbed off by the lies Shopkeepers tell you about why a puppy is in that state, or feel sorry it was the last one left and adopt it. Ask to play with the pup and observe it.

A bigger opponent can inflict much damage because of heavier, stronger blows. But having a strategy and brains is much more important. If he is bigger than you, you must be wiser than him. * Always guard your head with your forearms, a bigger guy could easily land a blow to your head because of his reach advantage. * To penetrate the inside range and intercept your fist towards the target, have the proper timing to parry (diverting your opponent's strike to a different direction) or slip his blow while shifting forward your feet (to compensate your disadvantage in reach) finding an opening simultaneously projecting the punch. This is a relatively risky maneuver but effective if only properly executed. * Never fight fair as you're already at a disadvantage because of his size. The main essence is to use your common sense, practicality, and to protect yourself. In a street fight there are no rules. If you have something in your hand(like a pen, bottle, or a rock) turn it into a defensive weapon. Throw a handful of sand in his eyes or slit his legs with a cutter. Poking the eye with hot sauce or chili powder is a clever way to temporarily incapacitate your foe and will give you the opportunity to give him combination of strikes or escape. As much as possible, do not engage in a street fight empty handed. Unlike in combat sports nothing is fair in a real fight. A weapon is a great equalizer, just imagine how David could have been badly beaten up by Goliath if they fought toe to toe, fair and square and armless. * Play dirty. Kick his groin, finger jab his eyes, throw a chopping blow to his throat, bite his ear (like Iron Mike against a bigger Holyfield). A hair grab is a very effective and practical move leaving him a lesser chance for mobility. By pulling his hair in a downward direction it will give you the opportunity to throw an uppercut or knee strike to the face. * These are the ways to break the and escape the when being grabbed. Deliver a headbutt to the face or bite the skin ( the massater which is the biting muscle is the strongest muscle in the human body.	.

Its custom-ability makes it adaptable to lots of different situations. * The Nerf raider is good for sabotage. Because of its slam fire you can fear the zombies with it. It is a good surprise weapon. * The stampede is a good support weapon. Use few of them though because they waste a lot of ammo with the 18 dart clip the 18 dart clips can be used by others while using the regular 6 dart clip just seems ineffective with the stampede. * Snipers are a good support for your team. Make them be well back from zombies and camouflaged if you wish. These people should be able to pick off zombies that are about to strike. Good sniper weapons are long strikes and long shots. Optionally you can modify these weapons for longer range. * Single loaded weapons like nite finders and reflexes are recommended as a secondary weapon. These are not really used as primary because of the long reload time.	.

Research the product itself. Some products last a long time, some do not last as long.	Read online reviews, then you can ask the owner questions to get an idea of if the product may have these problems. For example, let's say a certain electronic shows several complaints about the handle coming off, or the unit overheating when it sits idle for a few minutes--you can look closely at the used electronic in person to see if these defects are present. If you hadn't done the preliminary research, you would've never known to look! Another thing to consider, what does the device come with if you buy it new? This way, you'll know if there is anything missing, and the price should be adjusted to suit.

Your staff works how ever many hours for you and then lives the remainder in his or her personal life, which may leave a big impact, bleeding into work hours. Your employee may be cranky or have an off, low-producing day due to any number of personal reasons. (Still, remember it is their responsibility to deal with their personal lives on their time. You must remind them of this if they continually have the problem, but if it's a rare occurrence, do allow for the human limitation.) * Understand that things beyond your staff's control are bound to come up from time to time. As long as it's not habitual, it's in your best interest to treat your people like PEOPLE, not objects or numbers or cogs in your grand wheel. Give them the freedom to handle their personal issues, even if they come up on your time - as long as it isn't continual or egregious. * If you are on a tight budget, becoming a good boss can save you a ton of money. Many studies show how a staff that feels you care for them and value them will be far less motivated by money, and far more motivated by their sense of empowerment, value to you and the company, and the feeling that they have significant responsibilities. * Have fun with your staff. Joking with them and allowing them to see you as a human being binds them to you with feelings of friendship. Letting them address you as ""My King"" or ""Captain"" may amuse them. It's okay, then, should your staff start doing something like this, to address them occasionally as ""My Prince,"" or ""Lieutenant Commander!"" etc. This is charming to them and lets them know they are not simple minions, but essential members of your crew or ""royal court."" While it's important to maintain the reality of your position as their leader, it's also important that you be accessible. (And it's quite telling as to how they feel about you - being addressed with a bow and ""My Queen,"" even privately or in a light-hearted way says this person respects and admires you, and is willing to defer to you). * The owner or manager of a small company may be able to afford only a very meager year-end bonus. Instead of giving your team a teeny bonus of less than $50 each person, consider throwing a party for them - host it at your own home if you can. Your staff will be very touched that you have (A) invited them to your home, (B) spent money to cater for them, (C) provided a warm, fun event for them to share each other's company, and yours. Remember that $50 is a tank of gas that will be forgotten in a few days, but that party will give them a memory they may carry with them all their lives. A few themed party favors cost little but create loads of fun and good feelings. * Being a good boss really is a lot like being a king or queen. You have to rely on your people for so much, it's important that they feel loyal to you, and do things the way you want them done. Telling them to remember that wherever they go, even on their own time, they stand for you and your company, and to remember who they are in that light - it's actually a good thing. It makes them feel invested in the company in a very deep way, and those who are your very best will always go far above and beyond the call of duty to serve you to the best of their abilities. * Recognize that you need to learn to be a boss. Many of us are promoted to be a boss because we did a good job as employees."	Without some level of effort, you may not grow into a good boss. Instead, you may continue to be just a good employee to your new boss.

Be_Honest_Without_Being_Harsh.txt	Begin_Revision	0.956	## Steps	3261	But until you can be honest about your own weaknesses or share of the blame , you risk using lying or evasion of the truth to cover up your own sense of failing , especially if you have a tendency to compare yourself to others .	## Steps	3324	However , until you can be honest about your own weaknesses or share of the blame , you risk using lying or evasion of the truth to cover up your own sense of failing , especially if you have a tendency to compare yourself to others .	<insert><However><1>|||<replace><But><1><,><2>	True	"Steps  1. Remember that honesty is the basis of all healthy relationships, whether with a friend, a significant other, co-worker or any other person. Honesty gives rise to trust, which is absolutely essential for maintaining relationships. Honesty also establishes consistency, allowing the other person to rely on what you say as carrying true meaning. Most importantly of all, honesty is about respect and valuing the dignity of the other person. 2. Recognize how dishonesty plays itself out within a relationship. Lying to a friend or other person can ruin a relationship, sometimes instantly. Even if dishonest behavior goes undetected for a time, it will white ant your relationship––insincerity and a lack of investment in the well-being of the other person burrows into the subconscious of those at the receiving end, even through the most finely crafted lies and pretense. Dishonest behavior in relationships can include: * Fawning over someone even though you don't particularly like them. Sometimes this is to get something you want (such as a promotion, a role, a gift, money, etc.), while other times it is simply because you're too insecure to own up to not liking this person much. While it can be difficult to maintain relations with a person you don't much get along with, you can agree to respect each other's differences instead of lying outright. * Pretending you like something someone has done or made for you/given you/shared with you. For example, you might pretend to like a friend's rock-hard baking or pretend that your boss's presentation is fantastic even though it's a bore. In each case, you have an opportunity to enlighten the person that they need to improve but lying is a way of sidestepping this teaching role. Lying will often cause more of the same behavior and you'll have to endure more rock solid cakes and boring speeches when you could have compassionately shone a light on making improvements. A no-win for both of you. * Enabling bad behavior. Although more complex than there is room for discussion here, enabling behavior is a form of dishonesty. In letting the alcoholic have ""just one more drink"", or the internet-obsessed ""just another after-midnight hour online"", etc., you fail to address the root problem and enable the bad behavior. This type of dishonesty can let problems fester or grow, damaging both the other person and the relationship. * Brushing someone off. Sometimes dishonesty is as simple as saying ""Yes, that looks all right on you"", just because you can't be bothered or don't really care. This is a failure of paying attention and is insincere because you fail to want the best for the other person, giving your own wants greater attention. 3. Acknowledge why you feel a desire to lie instead of speak honestly. Honesty is often embarrassing or confronting. It requires clarity of thought, very carefully chosen words of candor and a commitment not to stray from the facts (keeping away from the minefield of emotional interpretations). Other reasons for lying include covering up your own weaknesses, maintaining compromises that make life easier to cope with and avoiding getting into trouble. And many people have been raised to see honesty as too ""blunt"" or ""rude""; yet rather than being an issue of etiquette, this stems from a misunderstanding as to how to put forward honest messages compassionately. There is a world of difference between being tactless and being considerately and respectfully open. 4. Be honest with yourself first. This may seem unusual, given that you're wanting to know how to be honest to others."	Being honest with yourself is about knowing––and accepting––yourself, warts and all. Good self knowledge means that you're less likely to try and conform to other people's expectations of you, lessening the need to lie to them. If you're not pretending to be someone you're not, then people already know what they can expect from you and you can spend more time focused on having a compassionate outlook toward other people instead of worrying about how you come across.

Find a bicycle in good working condition to modify. Make sure it is comfortable and has good brakes. Any problems the bike has when you start are going to be magnified once it has 40 pounds of electric ""stuff"" added to it and an extra horsepower pushing it around. It'll be harder to stop and the ride will be rougher. Full suspension department store bikes actually work well, but you'll probably want to change the low pressure knobby tires to some higher pressure street tires (going from 35 to 65psi makes a huge difference! this is a cheaper way to get extra range rather than buying more batteries). For this bike build, you want a bike with some space in the triangle between the rider's legs. 2. If your bike doesn't have multiple sprockets on the cranks (the part that your legs spins), you'll need one that does. Or, you can get the crank+sprockets from another bike and transplant them to the side of *your* bike that has no sprockets. 3. Get a rear rack for the bike. This is where your batteries will go. Want some extra storage capacity? You can use U bolts and some cheap plastic, rectangular trash cans from a place like Big Lots. Just attach them to the side of the rack using the U bolts. 4. Find some batteries. You need to know the voltage of your battery pack before you start buying the other parts. 24 volts and 36 volts are very common voltages for electric bikes. You can go higher but all the parts start to get more expensive and harder to find. The easiest to obtain and cheapest batteries are small gel cell lead acid batteries often used in uninterruptable power supplies (UPS). These come rated at 12 volts and 7 to 12 amp-hour capacity. Car batteries won't work! First off, if they turn over, the acid can spill out."	.

Know the duties of the job. A launch driver is responsible primarily for the operation of a launch boat, usually a 24-30 foot open-top, diesel-powered vessel. The launch driver often handles the operation and maintenance of the vessel, in addition to providing passengers with friendly service and useful information. Duties include: * Starting up the boat at the beginning of the day, making sure to check routine fluids including: * The level and condition of the engine oil (should be at the proper level as indicated on the dipstick and not too dirty). * The level of the coolant (should be visible when the cap is removed) (warning: never check coolant after running the engine, because hot coolant could spray out under pressure, causing injury). * The condition of the transmission fluid (should be dark red and translucent – if it is white and milky, salt has penetrated the transmission housing and must be flushed out before the transmission is engaged). * The amount of fuel in the tank – you don’t want to run out while untied in open water! * Tying the launch boat off while picking passengers up at the dock/pier. * Greeting the passengers warmly as they enter the boat and providing up-to-date weather information and harbor information. * Assisting passengers with stowing additional gear aboard the boat if they require help. * Navigating the waterways safely and in accordance with local navigational rules. * Planning and executing an efficient drop-off and pickup route around the harbor. * Approaching and landing safely on customers’ boats. * Helping boaters who need battery jump starts, boat tows, and mooring assistance. 2. Understand that there are pros and cons. In many ways, working as launch driver is a great occupation. Passing workdays under the sun on the open water is relaxing and fun. Often, launch drivers receive benefits such as free boat services at the boat yard or yacht club they work for, discounts on marine products, and flexible schedules. Some launch drivers are fortunate enough to work where tipping is the norm and may make a handsome amount of money in cash daily.	Working under the sun may sound nice at first, but after twelve hours it can be quite taxing. Additionally, it is often the sole responsibility of the driver(s) on duty to remember on the go which customers have radioed requesting future pickups, while at the same time completing pickups already on their route. This can lead to stress, as sometimes a pickup will slip your mind and anger a customer who has been waiting.

Buy a new vehicle with a good quality. Start from D class (or your own lever class). Don't buy a High Speed vehicle! Remember, if your car has a High Speed acceleration, it's hard for you to control your car. Choose good handling so it is easier for you to control your car. * For D class, it's a good idea to buy Audi R8 E-tron for beginning.  2. Start a race in Single Player. Choose which control you feel comfortable with. Start knockdown other racer and try to complete all levels with complete star!  3. Know the shortcut road! Remember to choose your way during race. Some of them are long, some of them are short. To find the short road, easy! Just across the road without nitro, the road without nitro is a shorter road. * Please keep on mind that you need Nitro to win the race, so use a long road when you need it! 4. Play Multiplayer mode! Race with a people from around the world is hard than you think! But remember the shortcut road, plan your strategy and your way to across before race. 5. Do an awesome skill to get enough nitro! Make a barrel roll, flat spin and other amazing movement to gain nitro and hit it up. * Barrel roll is easy, but the problem is Flat Spin. Many player having a trouble they don't know how to make a Flat Spin. Easy and simple, just make a drift when arrived at ramp and it will automatic do a Flat Spin. 6. Upgrade your car! If you have a enough money to upgrade your car, take this chance to upgrade your car to get a best result during race.  * Be clever, remember that acceleration and Top Speed will not lead you to victory, upgrade your handling so you easily to control your car. Upgrade handling before make another upgrade is better to evade from been crash during race. * Acceleration can push your car fast! Upgrade it if you need some extra speed. * Top Speed upgrade maximum speed into your car! Upgrade it to upgrade your speed and acceleration! * Nitro, the most powerful thing and must have if you want to win the race! Upgrade it so you can cut another racer easily and knockdown other racer easily in Single Player!!! 7. Play aggressive. Don't worry about other racer, play aggressive is need in Asphalt 8 to burn down your friend (or enemy) place and let's you lead to victory. So knockdown as many car you can! To knockdown other racer, hit up your nitro and ram them or hit them to knockdown them all! * in multiplayer mode, it's hard to knockdown other player because Gameloft just change their game knockdown mode to balance so everybody can safety play the game. But it's not a bad news. To knockdown in multiplayer mode, flank them from the side and push them to the wall as hard as you can and it will automatic knockdown! Or, simply hit up a maximum 100% Nitro with a Top Speed nitro (more than 35km/h nitro speed) and hit them from their back to knockdown it! * Another way to knockdown in multiplayer mode is to use Death From Above tactical strike! Go and ram into ramp and hit them from the skies! 8. Keep train yourself to become a better racer from before! * Try to drift perfectly without been hit or crash! 9. Refuel your nitro. * to refuel your nitro, just go and do some skill when across a ramp! Make barrel roll, flat spin and more! * knockdown can refuel your nitro, but just for 20% only. * drift perfectly as much as you can without crash! It will automatic refuel your nitro.

Be_Humble.txt	Begin_Revision	0.97	### Part Two: Appreciating Others	17584	Though saying you 're sorry to someone else is painful , you 'll have to get over your pride and tell another person that you 're sorry for the harm you 've done .	### Part Two: Appreciating Others	17680	Even though saying you 're sorry to someone else is painful , you 'll have to get over your pride and tell another person that you 're sorry for the harm you 've done .	<insert><Even><1>|||<replace><Though><1><though><2>	True	"Part Two: Appreciating Others  1. Appreciate the talents and qualities of others. Challenge yourself to look at others and appreciate the things they can do and, more generally, to appreciate people for who they are. Understand that everybody is different and relish the chance you have to experience different people. You will still have your personal tastes, your likes and dislikes, but train yourself to separate your opinions from your fears and you will appreciate others more - you will be humbler. * Being able to appreciate the talents and qualities of other people can also make you recognize qualities that you want to improve or attain within yourself. 2. Stop comparing yourself to others. It's nearly impossible to be humble when we're striving to be the ""best"" or trying to be better than others. Instead, try describing things more objectively. Rather than saying that so and so is the best guitarist ever, say what exactly it is that you appreciate about his skills, or simply say that you like his playing style. Let go of meaningless, simplistic comparisons, and you'll be able to enjoy doing things without worrying about whether you're better or worse at them than others. * Every individual is unique, and it's hard to truly say who is ""the best"" at something. 3. Don't be afraid to defer to others' judgment. It's easy to acknowledge that you make mistakes and that you're not always right. Somewhat more difficult however, is the ability to acknowledge that in many cases other people — even people who disagree with you — may be right. Deferring to your spouse's wishes, to a law you don't agree with, or even, sometimes, to your child's opinion takes your recognition of your limitations to a different level. * Instead of simply saying that you know that you're fallible, you take action based on that fact. * Of course, if you know that a particular course of action is wrong, you shouldn't follow it. On closer inspection, though, you may realize that you don't actually know this as often as you think you do. 4. Seek guidance from written texts. This is another way of appreciating others. Contemplate moral texts and proverbs about humility. Pray for it,meditate on it, do whatever it takes to get your attention off yourself. You can read inspiring biographies, memoirs, The Bible, nonfiction on how to improve your life, or whatever it is that makes you be more humble and appreciate the insight that others have to offer. * If you're not into spirituality, consider the scientific method. Science requires humility. It requires that you let go of your preconceived notions and judgments and understand that you don't know as much as you think you do. 5. Remain teachable. Find people you aspire to be like in certain areas, and ask them to mentor you. Under mentorship; good boundary setting, confidentiality and discernment is required. As soon as you cross the line of being 'unteachable', bring yourself back down to earth again. Being teachable means that you admit that you always have more to learn about life. * You can be more humble by taking classes in something you know nothing about, such as pottery or screen writing, and knowing that you will let others teach you. 6. Help others. A big part of being humble is respecting others, and part of respecting others is helping them. Treat other people as equals and help them because it is the right thing to do. It's been said that when you can help others who cannot possibly help you in return, you have learned humility. Helping people in need will also make you appreciate what you have even more, and will make you less proud. * It goes without saying: don't brag about all the volunteering you've done. 7. Go last. If you're in line with friends, picking prizes at an arcade, or scooping food onto your plate at a pot luck, go last. Let your friends, significant others, elders, total strangers, whoever, get in line ahead of you and don't rush to satisfy your own needs right away. It is more rewarding to let others have what they want and to sit back and wait your turn. * Ask yourself, ""Do I really need to do this first so badly?"" The answer will always be no. 8. Compliment others. Give someone you love, or even someone you barely know, a compliment just because. Tell your girlfriend she looks pretty today; compliment your co-workers new hairdo, or tell the check-out girl at the grocery store that you like her earrings. Or you can go deeper, and compliment important aspects of people's personalities. Give at least one compliment a day and you will see that other people have so much to offer to the world. * Focus on the positive attributes of others instead of always looking for their flaws. 9. Apologize. If you've made a mistake, then fess up and admit that you're wrong."	This will show the person that you value him or her greatly and that you acknowledge that you've made a mistake.

BE PREPARED. How will you pass your project without anything to show your teacher? Most teachers take off a chunk of points for late projects. Procrastination is one of the worst things that can happen when it comes to projects. Try getting to work on it the day or the day after it is assigned. Even if all you do is type up the title on the computer... that's still progress. Do a little bit each day. Don't overwhelm yourself. 2. PLAN AHEAD. Planning ahead will keep you more organized and more focused on what you want to do. Let's say it is October 5th and your project on the history of France is due October 26th... three solid weeks of work. Break up your project into a schedule. Make two columns. Write down each day from the day the project is assigned to the day the project is due in the left column and what you plan to accomplish in the right column. Make sure you're consistent with this and follow your schedule, otherwise you will be lost and confused. 3. FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES. If your teacher gives you the guidelines for your project, make sure you do EXACTLY what it says to do. Try not to overlook anything. Your teacher probably wants it in a specific way so it will be easier for him/her to grade it. Nothing says, ""I didn't read the guidelines and I don't really care,"" like a messy project with half of what you need missing. Even if you do not get everything because you couldn't find it, your teacher will give you credit for trying, as long as you can show them you did. 4. LOOK YOUR BEST. If you fix yourself up a little more than usual the day you give your presentation, you will feel more confident about yourself. Feeling and looking like you just rolled out of bed late on a Monday morning will just add twice as much stress for you. Fix your hair in a different way. Wear your best outfit. Splash on your favorite perfume/cologne. If you be the best you can be, you will feel at your best. 5. VOLUNTEER FIRST. Really, who likes presenting first? But the thing about being first to present means you get to get it over with as soon as possible. Some teachers even give bonus points to students who are brave enough to present first. The day you're supposed to present, volunteer to give your project first. You will definitely feel a lot better after it's over. Think about it... would you rather let everyone else go before you, with the the thought, ""I'm going next. I can't believe I have to present next! I don't want to do this!"" floating around in your head? You will just be putting more pressure on yourself. Don't be afraid. Remember, it's just a project. 6. SPEAK LOUDLY AND CLEARLY. How many times have you watched your classmates presentations and noticed how quietly they spoke and how their heads were hung low? I bet you can name a few. Don't do this. For one thing, major points will be taken off. Second of all, you will give off the impression that you're unprepared, which will take off even more points. Stand up straight; keep your shoulders back at ALL times. This will help you speak louder. Make sure you speak loud enough so the students in the back can hear you. You don't have to yell. Pretend you've given this project dozens of times already."	There's no rush. Relax.
Be_Gothic_As_a_Teenager.txt	Begin_Revision	0.974	## Steps	2839	Since you ca n't wear makeup , or at least not much of it at this age , stick to grooming techniques that do n't require it , but are at least a little disturbingly mature for your age .	## Steps	2886	If you ca n't wear makeup , or at least not much of it at this age , stick to grooming techniques that do n't require it , but are at least a little disturbingly mature for your age .	<replace><Since><1><If><1>	True	Steps  1. Think about why you want to be Gothic. Is it because, even at such a young age, your realize your mortality? Is it because people started to reject you for who you are? If so, those are bad reasons. as with If it's just to fit in, then consider other styles(if you choose the latter 3,please prepare to be deemed a poseur.). As a Goth, being in is out.Good reasons are if you can identify with the underlying philosophy behind the Literature movement Gothic(no it is not about death or gore.). 2. Make big changes over the summer. If you do this during school you're easily be named a 'wannabe' or a poser. You may still be called a wannabe or a poser if you do this over the summer, but your chances are better this way. You'll also have lots of time to convince your parents into your new 'experiment,' and more time to change your wardrobe into that 'gothic' look. 3. Convince your parents into letting you shop with friends. If you don't want your parents to know about your dramatic change, don't tell them. If you can have a sit down with your parents, explain in a different way why you want to do this. Tell them you want to find your individuality. If this doesn't work, ease into your change. They'll barely notice it, but it's a good idea to have a backup plan for when they do. 4. Research Gothic ways. Do your Gothic homework. Learn something of the bohemian movement, Sartre, Calmus, Nietzsche, all the way to Depeche Mode and The Cure. Most Goths are serious activists who care about animals and who love poetry, the arts, designing things, and making them unique. They express themselves in different ways. Find a way to express yourself in things you love, not what others like to do. Plus read realeated wiki-hows 5. Get a new wardrobe. Your closet has to be decked in dark colors. Don't worry about suspicion from your parents. A few key items can make your style totally Goth. Wear cross pendants, spikey bracelets and combat boots. Beat-up Docs work, also--no skater shoes such as Vans or Chucks. Put your own spin on these though, do not just merely give in to the post modern machine that further digs upon the western worlds grave every dying minute.Wear the crosses out of deep personal meaning or satire. Don't dress in all black. Thats what a wannabe does. Wear purples, reds and grays along with black. 6. Hair also adds into the Gothic appeal. Convince your parents to let you colour it. If that doesn't work, sneak in clip-on colour hair pieces when you're at school. Telling your parents to let you cut your hair into layers will help.It definitely works on boys. On girls, do the same. Get pomades to keep your hair in place where ever you put it, or leave your hair alone and let be natural, but still add some contrasting colour clip-on pieces. 7.	Keep good posture, maintain your fingernails well, and look after your skin and hair well. You will need these when you start wearing nail polish and lipstick when you're older.

Obtain the necessary licenses. To fly as a bush pilot, you will need at least 2 licenses granted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): a private pilot license and a commercial pilot license. You can obtain these licenses by attending an FAA-certified flight school and taking the required tests at the completion of your course. * A private pilot license allows you to legally operate an aircraft for private use, meaning you cannot charge money for your service. This is the most basic certification for flying a plane, and can be achieved in under a year if you attend flight school full-time. * A commercial pilot license allows you to legally be paid for services rendered with the use of your aircraft. You must have a private pilot license first to obtain this certification, and a commercial license is necessary to become a paid bush pilot. * A third permit which may be necessary is an air transport pilot license. This permit allows you to ferry passengers in your aircraft, which is a service often performed by Alaska bush pilots. 2. Attend a flight school course in bush flying. Once you have the necessary licenses to begin working as a commercial pilot, you will need to attend an additional course specifically designed to train bush pilots. * These courses, offered by several flight schools in the United States, are designed to teach skills specific to flying in adverse conditions. Taking off and landing without an airstrip, flying in low-visibility conditions, and taking off and landing on water are all necessary skills for bush pilots. * There is no FAA-administered certification that specifically targets 'bush' flying. However, before working as a bush pilot in Alaska, employers, airfield administrators, and customers will want you to have bush-specific training. 3. Begin contacting potential employers about being a bush pilot. You will not be able to begin flying as an independent contractor unless you already have a vast network of potential customers. Therefore, your career as a bush pilot begins with employment at one of a number of different types of companies. * There are several types of companies that hire trained bush pilots. Some act as mail carriers; some ferry passengers to remote resorts and hunting grounds; and some deliver supplies to remote areas. These companies usually maintain a staff of several trained pilots so that they can be available to meet any customer need. *	Working with the company in a non-pilot capacity for a while will make you a more attractive candidate when a pilot job becomes available.

Know your marking strategy. Marking helps protect your defensive zone of the field by covering space or opposing players to keeping them from scoring. Different coaches and teams have different preferences for how they like to mark, and often switch between techniques. The two main types of marking techniques are zone and man-to-man, and many teams use a mix of both depending on the situation. * Zone marking means a player is responsible for the space around them. For example, the right back is responsible for the back right corner of the field. Any opposing player who enters that space is their responsibility. It’s important to be clear on what each player’s zone is so that there is no “dead space” that is unaccounted for. This marking strategy is best when gameplay is spread out and opponents are interchanging positions, so that you can simply “switch” marks with your teammates instead of chasing them down the field. * Man-to-man marking means each player chooses an opponent to mark and always sticks with them, no matter where they go on the field. If you are man-to-man marking, it might be useful to memorize the number on your mark’s jersey so that you never lose her. This marking strategy is best when gameplay is past-paced and confined near the goal you are defending because it limits confusion on who is marking whom amidst potential chaos. Every single opponent who enters your defensive circle surrounding the goal should be closely marked at all times. * Marking is not just for defenders. Make it clear to your team (especially the midfielders) that they should be helping out with marking as well. Even your forwards should be sprinting back during a counterattack. 2. Place yourself on the correct side of your mark according to the situation. Sometimes it is best to step in front of your mark to block her from receiving a pass and intercepting it yourself. Other times it is better to stay close behind your mark (in between her and the goal) so that even if she receives the ball she cannot go straight to goal. * Deciding the best way to position yourself while marking should come naturally as you assess each scenario. When in doubt, ask your coach for advice. 3. Communicate to your teammates about who they should be marking.	.
Become_a_Dentist.txt	Begin_Revision	0.955	## Steps	3750	But , this will help you gain much needed behind-the-scenes experience at a dental office that you will not learn in dental school .	### Getting a Job	3826	However , this will help you gain much needed behind-the-scenes experience at a dental office that you will not learn in dental school .	<replace><But><1><However><1>	True	Steps  1. Determine whether you possess general characteristics to become a dentist. You'll need a high aptitude for science, outstanding manual dexterity, and good communication skills. You will also need time and family support. You will have to take the required undergraduate courses, which will take 3-4 years, followed by 4 years of dental school. * A dentist who runs his or her own practice needs employee management skills, a willingness to work 60+ hours weekly (at least in the early years), good business sense, plus capital for the investment. 2. Complete your prerequisite educational requirements. In the US you will need to attend high school and college before you are qualified to apply to dental school. Take useful courses in high school, such as chemistry, biology, physics, math, and health so that you will be prepared for your college coursework. You will take your prerequisite courses for dental school at a college or university. 3. Be smart about the undergraduate classes you choose. Also, be aware that most dental schools will require that you to have a bachelor's degree. Many undergraduate students who apply to dental school choose a science major, though it is not required. * All US dental schools have undergraduate course requirements, which will be published on their websites. If you do not have credit in these courses, your applications will not be considered complete. Fortunately, most dental schools require similar courses. Nonetheless, it is your responsibility to know where you plan to apply, and what each particular school requires. * 2014 example course requirement list from Baylor College of Dentistry: 6 hours of English, 8 hours of Chemistry, 8 hours of Organic Chemistry, 8 hours of Physics, 3 hours of Biochemistry, 14 hours of Biology, 3 hours of Statistics. * Take an anatomy and/or comparative anatomy course in your biology mix. This will give you a head start in Gross Anatomy, which is one of your first major classes in dental school. Universally, Gross Anatomy is an extremely demanding and heavily weighted course. If you have familiarity with mammalian anatomy you will find it a little easier. * Take at least one 2D and one 3D studio art class. Your fine motor skills are imperative to your success as a dentist. If you do not enjoy and do well in the studio courses you may want to reconsider applying to dental school. Unfortunately, many academically strong students will start dental school, only to find later in the game that they do not have the necessary natural talent or interest to succeed as a clinical practitioner. 4. Take the Dental Admissions Test (DAT). Taking the test requires paying a fee and scheduling a date to take the test at a Prometric Test Center. See the ADA (American Dental Association) website for more information. 5. Apply for admission to a dental school. Most applicants apply to more than one dental school. Only apply to dental schools that are accredited by the ADA's Commission on Dental Accreditation. * Your undergraduate grades, score on the DAT, recommendations, and interviews are considered in the admission process. 6. Attend dental school. Once accepted, you will attend for 4 years. * Take didactic courses. You will continue to study anatomy, microbiology, biochemistry, and physiology in the classroom and lab. * Take clinical courses. You will also learn how to treat patients in the school's dental clinics. The clinical courses you will take include but are not limited to pedodontics, restorative dentistry, endodontics, dental radiology, oral surgery, removable prosthodontics, fixed prosthodontics, periodontics, and oral diagnosis. 7. Get professional experience. If you can manage your time effectively, get a part-time job in a dental office as a dental assistant or receptionist while you are in dental school. Chances are, you will not be able to work more than 10 hours a week.	.

Consider a prescription diet. If your cat has kidney failure, talk to your veterinarian. He or she may prescribe a special renal diet that contains restricted amounts of high-quality protein and minimal amounts of phosphate and certain minerals. Protein, phosphate, and minerals are very difficult for the kidney to filter, so prescription diets that restrict these substances place less strain on the organ. * Studies show that phosphate can also cause scar tissue to build up on the kidney, so it is doubly important to restrict phosphate in your cat’s diet. 2. Discuss the best protein and nutrient sources with your veterinarian if you plan to use a home-prepared diet. Veterinarians used to suggest relying primarily on white meats – chicken, turkey, and white fish – because they are easier to digest and place less strain on the kidney than other foods. However, a cat with kidney failure still needs to consume a balanced diet, including good sources of vitamins and certain minerals – especially calcium, which is essential for the heart, bones, and eyes. Your veterinarian may therefore recommend a more balanced mix of foods. * Over time, a diet made up only of white meat may cause your cat to develop swollen joints, fragile bones, failing vision, or heart failure. 3. Provide foods that your cat likes. The most important thing, for a cat with kidney failure, is to make sure it eats something. Some cats will starve themselves if they don’t like the food they are offered; there’s no point, then, in providing a prescription or home-prepared renal diet that remains uneaten. It’s better to compromise and give your cat something appealing to eat.	.

Also practice climbing objects, unreachable by yourself, with a friend. * When spying in public look like your doing something. Its more likely you won't be noticed if you look like your busy. * If you are wearing sneakers or any type of hard footwear, walk on the outside edges of your feet. This is what soldiers in combat boots do! * Try to walk around, moving around your ankle to make sure to get any cracks out of your foot before sneaking around. Cracks can be give-away noises. * Remember when you're outside in the dark and they are in doors with the light on looking out side they can't see you like you can them, enjoy cat walking. * Don't bring a cell phone, iPod, or anything electronic of that nature. The light from these devices are a dead giveaway. Bringing a small video camera is okay, as long as it is small, and there are no lights that flash on it. You wouldn't want to be caught because your friend texted you. * Bring a buddy -- two heads are better than one. Be careful who you choose. Be sure you've considered the situation before you bring a friend. * One of the biggest problems when using stealth is dogs. If they see you, they bark. If they bark, the owner knows something is there. If he knows something is there, he will investigate. If he investigates, he could find you. * If you need to run, stay low and land on the balls of your feet to reduce the noise. * Never wear pure black in the woods, because pure black doesn't naturally occur, and should instead wear a dark navy blue, or a dark green. * When working with a buddy, try to keep to hand signals and vision signals. For instance, if you are trying to get from point A to point B without being seen, use signals such as hold two fingers up to your eyes to indicate that you see someone, then hold up the amount of fingers representative of the amount of people. * Always be mindful of any shadow or reflection you might make. This could very well give you away. * If you step down heel first then slowly move your foot down to the ground you will make no noise audible to the naked ear. * When going through a door, inside or out, turn the knob slowly while lifting the door as much as possible. This will take strain off off the hinges and prevent the door from squeaking.	The surface of a door will magnify creaking hinges, pushing firmly on it can reduce this effect.

Download music. Nobody wants to hang out with some poser scene kid. Listen to the music while following the steps below. * If you like metal, listen to hardcore bands like job for a cowboy, first blood, bring me the horizon, all shall perish, orchid, stick to your guns, acacia strain, terror or from a second story window. * If you're more interested in pop, listen to some electronic like hellogoodbye, katy perry, panic at the disco, daft punk, postal service or even Gwen Stefani. * Want something mellow/soft? Try indie like bright eyes, death cab for cutie, ben kweller, peter and the wolf or voxtrot. * If you're looking for something in between try screamo. Examples include chiodos, silverstein, the used, thursday, senses fail, underoath, my chemical romance, tokio hotel, and saosin. 2. It should be assumed that you have a myspace unless you've been living under a rock. If you don't have one, get one. 3. Get your pretty on. The most important part of the scene look is the hair. You can get away with any clothes as long as your hair is perfect. The typical scene hairstyle is unisex and works for all lengths/hair types. Just make sure you have short layers at the top and side bangs. Cut them yourself if you can. Women can also have straight bangs. Don't forget to get your hair thinned out. 4. STYLE it! Straighten your hair completely flat. If your hair seems frizzy, add shine serum. If you're a boy with longer hair, stop here because you're done. Everyone else, grab those teasing combs. Only tease the uppermost shortest layers if you have short hair. If you have long hair, tease the upper half of your head. Everybody also DON'T FORGET TO HAIRSPRAY! Obviously don't tease your bangs. 5. Hair color isn't that important. Why? Sure, you can go ahead and dye your whole head green but its a lot easier/healthier/trendier to add a few streaks of any color into your hair using extentions. Fashioncore needs to be up to the minute, so this is the way to go. At the moment neon is in style, but check out hair on the runways to see what's in the next season. Also, some people add coontails to their hair, which is probably on the outs by the time you'll read this. Either go to your local ghetto hair place and buy the extensions or go to sally's or even buy them on myspace. You can glue them to your hair or clip them in. Just make sure to trim the extention to the length of your actual hair when doing streaks. Make it look real. Its not that difficult. 6. ZOMGFASHIONZ! Boys have it easy here. Buy tightest pants possible. Add tight graphic tee or band tee. Go to next step. Ladies have the real options. Here are a few looks a scene girl could try out[at least for this season]: * A casual look can be skinny jeans in a black or light wash ripped with a tight graphic or band tee. * You could substitute t shirts with other tops like beater tanks or regular tanks in the summer. Try one white or black tank with a neon color underneath. * Another idea is to swap out the skinny jeans for shorts. * A more glam look can be leggings with an oversize t shirt. Just make sure the shirt is large enough to cover your crotch. * Try high waisted shorts with a striped shirt tucked into it. * In the winter, wear a cardigan sweater or a hoodie. This is a unisex look. Just make sure your choice fits you snugly. 7. Make your face all VOGUE PRETTY. Seriously, no guyliner unless you're actually a rock star. You will still need to be flawless. Drink 8 glasses of water each day. It really does clear up skin, even better than proactiv. Girls have more options. * For the casual look, start with whatever you usually use to cover blemishes. Add blush and cheek highlighter. Smooth a white eyeshadow underneath your eyebrow and above your top lash. Then apply a black eyeliner on top and bottom and follow with 2 coats of mascara. * When getting dressed up, use a color eyeshadow on your lids and follow the rest of the directions for the casual look. The eyeshadow can be black or neon. Use whatever colors compliment your eyecolor. Use blue for blue eyes, pink for hazel, yellow for brown and green or purple for green eyes. 8. Shoes! Unisex shoes are great for casual looks. These include converse, vans, reebok freestyles and nike dunks. Girls can wear ballet flats or pumps with any outfit and probably get away with it. 9. Now for the trimmings. Guy accessories include bandannas[worn around neck, face or wrist and folded in back pocket], huge sunglasses, white studded belts, and oversized novelty belt buckles. Scene girls can wear these for a casual look as well but just add an oversize purse. Girls also wear necklaces with oversized pendants as well. They should also wear a hairbow or a headband. Tiaras are for birthdays only. Also, if you need to wear glasses, they should be plastic. The current trend is to get your grammas old huge plastic frames and get them filled with your prescription. If you don't have those, get prescription raybans. 10. Facial piercings, plugs and tattoos are scene too. When getting a tattoo, just make sure not to get any tribal tattoos. Nothing in this step is mandatory though. 11. Take FLATTERING pictures of yourself and put them on your myspace. Try not to do the hold the camera pose or the peace sign. Find one of your favorite beauty products/foods/beverage/cds and hold it up. Use the timer on your camera and take a picture of yourself with it. Upload! 12. Add, add, add friends on myspace. Have you added everyone in your area in your age range? That's a good start, but if you want fame, which you DO, you're going to need a higher friend count than that. Go to friend adding sites. Add kids who look scene. Myspace only lets you add 400 people a day, so hop to it! Strive for a six figure friend list. 13. By now, you should have listened to some scene music with all the dance parties you must have had while getting your fashioncore on. Add all the bands you liked on myspace and find what dates they are coming to your town. Go to every show you can even if its local. You need to be seen to be scene. Bring a friend so you don't look lame and make sure you look your absolute best. Learn to do the dances you see at the shows. If you have a band, talk to the band after the show. They probably know people who can get you gigs. 14. Get an internet capable phone like a sidekick, iphone, instinct or dare. The more you are on it, the more popular you look. This will annoy your friends and family. When they confront you, ask them, ""Are you judging me?"" This is an amazing zinger. 15. Post bulletins on myspace from your phone whenever you're about to do something[playing video games, going to shows, going to the mall, etc.]. Also ask people to leave you comments and talk to you. Doing this ensures that everyone knows where all the action is at. After a fun night, post a blog detailing all the upscale things you did. They don't need to be upscale, just make them seem like they are. For example, if a friend comes over, don't talk about how you guys just chilled. Talk about how cool they are."	Don't divulge every detail of your life.

Name beneficiaries on your life insurance policies. Because life insurance is paid directly to the named beneficiary, the funds never become a part of the probate estate, and are therefore not subject to probate taxes and fees. You may also wish to name a secondary beneficiary, in case the primary beneficiary predeceases you. 2. Hold your assets in cash and/or bearer certificates. Assets held in cash or bearer certificates, such as stock, may be excluded from the probate estate, reducing the amount of fees and taxes charged to it. A bearer certificate is a financial instrument, such as a check payable to ‘cash’, which may be redeemed by any party possessing it. 3. Add a Pay on Death (“POD”) or Transfer on Death (“TOD”) designation to your accounts.This can only be done in the USA. Canada does not have such a law for non-registered investment accounts. Only Registered accounts such as an RRSP, RRIF, TFSA accounts can have named beneficiaries. Joint Ownership is the only way to avoid probate for non-registered accounts. * A POD or TOD designation allows you to decide to whom the property will transfer or be paid upon your death.	To name a POD or TOD, contact the bank or investment firm where the account is held. The procedure will vary from company to company and will most often involve filling out and returning a simple form.

The Joker usually spoke in a low, husky voice. Sometimes he would randomly shout out things to catch people off guard. Try saying some stuff in a low whisper. Then yell out a few sentences randomly and with evil glee. 3. Practice the Joker's unsettling laugh. The Joker's laugh is a sort of husky cackle that sounds pretty deranged.	That will help you sound huskier. Then laugh long and hard. Think about how witches cackle in movies. Aim for something like that, but crazier.

Avoid listening to music. When walking in public, you should avoid listening to music on a cell phone or other personal listening device. The music could distract you to various dangers, and someone could take advantage of you as you’re listening to your music. 2. Don’t play with your smart phone. While it may seem like a normal thing to do, playing with or checking texts on your smart phone could distract you. A mugger may see this and identify you as a potential victim. Thus, avoid playing with your smart phone if you think you might be in danger. * In addition to your phone being a distraction, it might also be something a mugger wants to steal. 3. Look around. As you walk, make sure to look around. Walk with your head up and look from side to side occasionally. Ultimately, the more you are aware of your surroundings, the easier you’ll be able to avoid being mugged. * If you see someone suspicious or threatening, walk away from them. * Be careful turning corners. Try to make a long turn so you can see what’s around a corner before you turn it. After all, there could be a mugger waiting on the other side of the corner. 4. Travel on well-lit streets. The more light on a street, the less likely a person will try to mug you without fear.	In addition, avoid dark streets and dark areas of town.

Talk to others about their experiences while high. Even if you don't use marijuana, chances are you know someone who either does or did in the past. Explain to the person you are preparing for dramatic role, and ask questions about his or her experiences. * You can attain an even better understanding of your friend's memories by asking him or her to reenact their experiences rather than simply describing them. * You can best prepare to act high by recording your sessions. Each time you speak with a person about their memories of being high, record the discussion. You will get an even better grasp of the behaviors by watching the sessions multiple times. 3. Watch others smoke marijuana. If you live in a place where marijuana use is legal, you can see how to act high firsthand by watching others smoke the plant or ingest it through edibles. Pay attention to their mannerisms, actions, speech patterns and behaviors. 4. Try some marijuana."	Only try a small amount if you are not an experienced smoker.

You don't necessarily need to get designer names- flared jeans that fit sightly around your hips but loosely around your legs are a great start,a few Hollister and Abercrombie wont hurt though. Double layered shirt with a sheer top layer and silky under layer make you look thinner. Bright or light colors in clothing are best, stand out but don't wear revealing clothes, because that will follow you to high school and people will call you names. Spend cheap- having a lot of unique clothes is better then having one expensive shirt. * You dont need to have a cool gadgets. But if you want you can get a laptop, digital camera, ipod, and cell phone. All of those are nice to have but you can live without them until like middle school...execpt I couldnt live without an ipod. Lol. Not because everyone had one but just because I love to listen to music. Lol. :) 1. Do well in school. Get A's and B's. People will think you are perfect if you're popular and smart.

Spend time with people who are doing ""positive activities"" that you want to do. It's getting increasingly easy to spend too much time alone. While some solitude can be good, even loners have to come out to work, play or eat sometimes. To act normally and behave in a well-adjusted manner (not too different), it's important to spend time around other people, socializing and learning from them, so you can interact more directly and easily get involved. Just being around a variety of people in a coffee shop, or at a restaurant, or at the movies, can help you learn about others and feel less isolated. This will make you more comfortable in your own skin, the more experienced at opening up and interacting you can become.center|550px * Find places and go where you're likely to run into like-minded people. Love comics? Quit buying them online and hit up your local comic shop. Love to make art? Head to an art class, craft store or the museum. Take a class in one of your interests and talk some with others learning the same topic or skill. Get in a choir or take music lessons. Some churches have music school and sport activities. * Online friends exist in a gray area. They're ""real"" a lot of the time, but our interactions online are much different than our up close, mano-a-mano interactions. Try to balance your time socializing online with at least as much, if not more, face-to-face interactions. 2. Be happier, by not hanging around with people who act out in negative, too wild or crazy ways. They may get themselves and you into unwanted difficulties and disgrace, so to speak. Avoid getting closer or hooked up with hateful, troubled, mean, destructive or too angry acting persons.center|550px * You might help other people do (make or fix) something you would like to, if they want your opinion or assistance. * Don't go looking for trouble; let it come to you (and try to stay out of it). 3. Pay attention to the body language of others. When you're around people, pay attention to the cues they're giving you about how to behave to get some cues for what ""normal"" might mean in that situation.center|550px * Mirror the behavior of others, if it makes you comfortable. When you're in the library and everyone looks very studious, quiet, and absorbed in their work, it's probably not the best time to start cutting up and trying to make jokes. If everyone's dancing at a school dance, it might be normal to dance, but you don't have to. It's normal to feel both ways. * If your neighbor at the lunch table keeps trying to make eye contact and smiling at you, it's probably a good time for a conversation, if you feel open. Try being friendly. Available communicating people often use open posture–shoulders back, head up, not too relaxed. Relaxing but not acting open may be about, instead, acting tired, sleepy, angry, shy or grumpy. Arms and legs crossed may be a sign that they are satisfied to sit alone, not looking to be friendly. Learn to recognize and not act that way in your own interactions. * If people are uncommunicative or closed off to you–head down, arms crossed–they probably don't want to talk. If you press the issue, it's possible that you might make them feel uncomfortable. Learn to recognize this and disengage from the conversation or interaction. Give them some space. 4. Be a good listener and wait for your turn to speak. When you're talking with someone, or with a group of people, try and balance listening and talking in equal measure. You don't have to be the one to contribute the most if you want to be noticed–it's just as important to be an active listener. Look at the person who is talking, nod your head to show that you're listening, and really listen to what is being said.center|550px * Stay on topic. If everyone in a group is going around telling stories about their weekend, tell a story about your weekend, if you have one. It would be kind of strange to break the spirit of the moment: ""I had to watch my dad eat pickled herring. He eats weird stuff all the time."" That's not really about your weekend; we hope. Don't hijack a conversation and take it elsewhere, or else, expect groans and protests at your [sense of humor] breaking the line of thought -- unless it's time to change the topic! * Listening doesn't mean: looking across the room or thinking of what you're going to say until a moment of silence appears in a conversation for you to fill."	"Accept the others point as worthwhile -- even if you heard it already. Then without a yawn or cut-down say, ""Hey, yeah, [excellent point/that's true] -- and have you ever [been to/done this] ___..."""

Learn how to coach all the positions on your team. Although you always want to concentrate on consistency and working together as a team, it’s important that you learn how to develop each player’s individual skills. Every player will have different strengths, weaknesses, and temperaments. A good coach will know how to use these attributes to their team’s advantage. The more you win, the more you'll receive offers from bigger teams to coach. * If you don’t know how to coach all positions including, receiving, blocking, defending, catching, running, and throwing, you are severely limiting your players' development. * You don’t have to be good at everything, just make sure that you have an understanding of all positions. Maintain and hire a staff who will make up for your weaknesses. 2. Communicate effectively to your team and staff. A good coach must have good communication. You should be concise with your goals to both your staff and your team. Set clear expectations and be consistent with your rules. Coaching on a professional level requires that you can choose talented staff and delegate responsibilities to create the most effective team. * This means taking your staff or player complaints seriously and potentially altering your coaching methods based off them. * Become friends with your staff so you can speak candidly and open with them. 3. Attend football clinics, conferences, and camps. A coaching clinic or camp is a gathering of successful coaches with the aim of improving coaching technique and strategy. At these events you’ll learn about player development and expand your coaching knowledge. Attending a conference is also another great opportunity to network with other coaches and find potential job openings. * Other coaches may know about job openings or may have vacant assistant coach positions on their teams. Always be friendly and try to meet as many people as you can. 4. Motivate your players to achieve better results. Having all the knowledge is a start, but you also need to have the charisma to motivate your team when they have had a difficult game or practice.	Work on listening to your players and figure out what motivates and drives them and be passionate and remain interested in their development.

Apply wax to the ledge so you can slide easier. Use specialty skateboard wax for best results. Rub a small amount over the entire surface of the ledge. Rub the block of wax directly onto the surface to cover the top, sides, and corners. If the board sticks to the surface, apply more wax as needed. * You can purchase wax at a skateboard shop or online. * Without wax, it may be hard to slide across the surface. * Do not apply wax to private property to avoid damages. Only use wax on public property or you may get charged with damages. 2. Roll toward the ledge at a comfortable speed. For best results, position your skateboard at a 45-degree angle as you ride closer. The slight angle helps you easily get onto the ledge. Skate at a moderate speed that feels comfortable for you. * Avoid going too fast when you start. If you have too much speed, it may be hard to adjust your footing. 3. Do an ollie to get onto the ledge. Performing the ollie trick helps you get onto the ledge. Put 1 foot toward the tail of the skateboard, and place your other foot directly behind the front hardware. Bend your knees to crouch down, and jump upward with moderate force. The board jumps up with you.	.

Set specific goals. General consistency is great, but being consistent is a lot easier and more likely to succeed if you set specific goals. These goals will help you behave consistently and give you something to strive for. You can set a variety of goals in different areas of your life * Consider how you want to use consistency to achieve your specific goals. For example, if your specific goal is to lose weight, you would need to work on being consistent with exercise, with your diet (eating healthy foods), etc. * As another example: if you want to get a book published, you would need to be consistent about writing each day, about devoting time to editing, about figuring out the publishing world, and sending your manuscript off. * A list of goals might look something like this: save up money for retirement, be on time to work, remember to help your significant other at home, getting all your reading completed for your class. Being consistent will mean setting aside a part of your paycheck each month, setting your alarm clock for earlier, taking care of the baby so your significant other can have certain nights off, and carving out time to do all the reading for your class. 2. Make change slowly. If you try to do everything at once all you're going to do is overwhelm yourself. It will make it a lot harder for you to be consistent. Make gradual changes instead of jumping in head first. * If you can do something for three weeks, it will become part of your routine. Pick 1 thing you'll work to be consistent in for a month. When that month is up, add another thing to be consistent in. * For example: If you have a goal to be a better team player at work, choose a few things that will help you achieve that goal. For a month, practice deferring to others in group projects, or finding ways to incorporate your ideas into theirs. Once you've gotten a handle on that, add another change to your routine. 3. Set specific boundaries. Boundaries will make it easier to be consistent, because then you have a specific limit in which to function, rather than a vague ""I'm going to be consistent."" Setting a boundary really just means setting constraints on exactly how and when you're going to do certain things. * For example: instead of just saying ""I'm going to be consistent about appreciating my significant other"" you might say ""I'm going to thank my significant other when they do things like wash the dishes or make dinner or help out around the house."" * Another example might be making quality markers for your work. This would mean figuring out certain standards to set. This could mean having your boss at work describe what they thought your best work has been, and trying to make your work consistently up to that standard. 4. Hold yourself accountable. To be consistent you have to make sure that you recognize when you don't come up to the standards and goals that you've set. When you don't act consistently with your goals. * On a calendar write down each day whether you succeeded or failed in following your consistency goals. If you failed, explain why you didn't follow them. This will help keep you accountable to when you don't follow your goals and your boundaries and will also serve as a marker of your progress. * Tell people you trust about your goals and your attempts to be consistent about various aspects of your life."	.

Wear practical clothes, not stylish clothes. If you’re willing to get deer blood and mud on whatever you’re wearing, then you’re dressed good enough for a redneck. Redneck life is about being prepared and capable for what comes at you, not looking any particular way. There are some associated styles, brands, and “looks” with being a redneck, but mostly that just comes from those looks being functional.center * Try to wear “work clothes” as much as possible. That might mean jeans, but it might not. You just want to wear clothes that aren’t fancy, and can take a beating. * For some people, North Face gear is pretty practical, if you work in a very cold mountain climate in the outdoors. For others, it’s luxury wear. Just make sure what you’re wearing serves a purpose for your lifestyle. 2. Get some boots. Rednecks need practical footwear, appropriate for working on cars, trampling through the woods, and getting dirty. Rednecks don’t wear pumps, flip-flops, or sneakers. They wear work boots, and are ready to get ‘em muddy.center * Thick-soled low-top shoes are also perfectly appropriate, you just want to make sure you’re in some shoes that you’d be comfortable in if you ended up in some wilderness. Hiking boots, riding boots, or motorcycle boots will all work in a pinch. * Cowboy boots are often worn for special occasions, or if you actually work on a ranch, but they’re not usually every day wear. 3. Wear denim and flannel. For men and women, redneck style can be pretty similar. You want to look like you’re ready to get to work, or like you’ve just stepped off the ranch. Flannel shirts, printed t-shirts, and denim jeans are the most common attire of the redneck, at any time of year.center * Given the option, opt for Wranglers. Boot cut. * Layering a good deer hunting tee under your thin flannel shirt? Always looks good. 4. Shop at the right stores. Rednecks fit clothes shopping in somewhere between town trips to the auto parts store, the feed store, and a quick pit stop at an uncle’s house. The less time spent shopping for clothes, the better. Tighten up your clothes-shopping by getting clothes at sporting goods stores and rural outfitters, who sell outdoors gear. Two birds, one stone.center * The mall? Not so much. Rednecks love a deal, the type of which can be found at any box store with things on the cheap. Get clothes on sale at K-Mart, Wal-Mart, and other places with good deals. * To save money, wear hand-me-downs and second-hand clothes. New shirts are just going to get dirty and ragged. Might as well use some old ones.	.

There are many options, but in reality, there are only 7 which you should pay attention to; ignore all the other options and just focus on one of those. Once you have chosen, make everyone you know aware of your decision to audition for this corps and devote all of your appreciation towards that one corps alone - indecision is viewed as a sign of weakness in the drum corps world, and you might find yourself barred from ever joining a corps before you even set foot in an audition. 2. Register for the Audition Camp. Once your decisions has been finalized, make sure that you register to attend only the audition camp for this corps (this usually takes place in November). They will know if you are trying to audition in more than one place, and this will be seen as a lack of commitment and loyalty. Drum corps people hate people from other drum corps that they compete against, and they will view members of other corps as ""tainted"". Plus, you will waste money trying to go to multiple camps. 3. Gear up. It is very important that you have a nice practice pad, such as an Invader or Xymox. If you show up with a cheap ""Real Feal"" or some junk like that, not only will every one else laugh at you, but the staff will think that you are not serious or committed. Also make sure that you buy and wear a sweatshirt sporting the logo of the corps so that everyone will know that you are interested in that corps while you are at the audition camp for that same corps. PRO TIP: do not worry about getting new sticks for your audition. In fact, the more broken they are, the better. When the staff sees you playing with broken sticks, they will be thinking something like this: ""Woaw, if he can play THIS good with broken sticks, then just IMAGINE how good he must be with a fresh pair!"" 4. Practice for the audition. Before the audition, make sure you learn the packet that is given to you before the camp. However, as you know, the packet is probably pretty easy, and almost everyone auditioning will be able to play it. The truth is the packet is just a test; if you show up for the audition and you only know the packet, then the staff will think you made no initiative to go above and beyond. Make sure you know all of the drum features that the corps has played in the last 5 years, and especially the drum feature from the corps's previous summer. Make sure you play the feature with any vets who might be present so that the vets and the staff will know that you are good enough to have potentially been on the line last year. 5. Pick a solo piece. Sometimes, during your individual audition you will be required to play a solo piece. This will be the most important part of your audition because it will demonstrate the best of your abilities. This solo should be played as fast as possible and contain a variety of stick tricks. A good idea would be to transcribe a 1st place I&E solo, such as Keelan Tobia's ""10 Second Lick"". 6. How to act at the audition. So you finally made it to the audition! What do you do now? Your primary goal is to demonstrate that you are better than everyone else there. Make sure you are constantly playing on your pad. Pick your best lick and play it over and over to ensure that everyone will see you playing it at least once. When you are on a drum, make sure that you do not listen to the person inside of you . This way, the staff will see when you are right and the person inside you is wrong, and they will know that you are better. Do you best to get on a drum next to a vet, even if you have to shove someone else out of the way - this will basically guarantee that you will be getting a spot because it will show how badly you want to get a spot. Make sure to act as arrogant as possible - because as we all know, a drum line must be exude a confident, and almost cocky image. When you make mistakes, make upset faces - this will let the staff know that you are aware of your short comings, and that you are disappointing in yourself and you could have done better. Remember, if you forget the notes to a certain part, it is always better to try your luck and guess what the part is than it is to break; even though it is only the first camp, DCI members must be able to learn on the fly and memorize music the instant they get it, and if you break it will show that you are not ready. Above all else remember this: this activity is not about blending in with everyone - it's about showing you, as an individual, are the best one around. 7. The Individual Audition. The individual audition is the most important part because it tests how you play under pressure."	"First, before you play a single note, start off with a speech about how marching DCI is your dream and talk about how hard you've been working for your audition. If your speech is good enough, you might even be given a 1 based on that alone and not even have to play a single note. When you are asked to play an exercize, it is imperative that you mark time, bring your sticks out on 3, and dut yourself in - just as if you were playing in a line, even though you are by yourself. I can't stress enough importance of your self-duts. If your duts aren't good enough, you might as well just give up right then and there because you are going to get cut. Make sure your self-duts are long, delicate, and child-like so that the sound of your drum will appear to sound louder by comparison. If you make a mistake, stop, apologize, and start over so that the staff knows that you know you made a mistake, and so you can show off your proper manners. If you make a lot of mistakes, make sure to explain how nervous you are so that the staff will know to apply the ""nervous formula"". Basically, the way this works is that the staff knows that a drummer will play worse while nervous than if he was calm, so they take all the nervous auditioner's scores and multiply it by anywhere from x2 to x10 (depending on HOW nervous they were) to try to figure out how good they would have been if they had not been nervous."
Be_the_Dream_Boy.txt	Inside_Revision	0.603	## Steps	230	Because when that happens girls tell their friends & family , every person they know , about it .	## Steps	286	And when that happens girls tell their friends & family , every person they know , about it .	<replace><Because><1><And><1>	True	"Steps  1. Work on your attitude. Attitude is really important, be sweet, confident, not ""touchy feely"" (one day it will be your time), be smart (most girls love smart guys, with a north & a bright future) 2. Be confident, most girls love confident guys in our side, guys who look us in the eyes, and like themselves, but don't get full of yourself (lots of girls will hate you if you're cocky). 3. JUST BE A GENTLEMEN WITH HER. However, don't be a gentlemen with a different girl, it will just make her jealous,(but you can open the door for both girls of course,) and don't talk about your ex-girlfriends. Talk about your life & ask her questions about her life & stuff (but don't ask anything freaky.) 4. When you're on a date, here are some simple things you can do to be a gentleman. * Open the car door, and the building doors for your date * Pay for your dinners * If you've been in a relationship with her a while give her a smooth good night kiss. It's romantic & sweet. 5. Have eyes only for your couple. Any girl will hate it when their boyfriend looks at other girls in a flirty way. 6. If you're in solid relationship & you haven't take the next step, don't push it. No girl will like it when boys push us to have sex (if you're nice and patient your time will come.) 7. Get a new look. If your dirty looking, make your self eleagent, classy, or like a normal guy, with t-shirts, jean (skinny jeans or normal jeans, but no baggy pants.) Wear Bostonian shoes, or converse, sneakers, vans, etc... They are nice shoes to wear to a date in a park or whatever. 8. Use a clock. Say, you're making out in a car with your girlfriend, it's late, her parents are freaking out, they don't know where you guys are, they might even call the police! You can make out in the car, but you need to make sure at what hour take your girl home. Thats why the clock its important. 9. Get a haircut, it can short, long, emo, afro... it needs to look good, so keep it clean. Personally I like emo hair, but I've seen many guys with long hair, and afros that they look really cute also.. 10. If your in bad shape, workout. Girls love touching abs! If your super thin, gain some weight & workout. If your over weight, make a healthy diet & workout,also. 11. If your shy, don't be the guy in the corner, try to socialize. 12. When you're with your signifigant other and you get a call, ignore it, unless are your parents or a sick relative. But if is a guy in your group inviting you to go drink some beers, decline, it'll be rude to your date. 13. If you move to the next level, use a condom. After you have ""you know what"", don't leave her, 'cause it will be mean, and you will get a reputation of being a male whore (it could happen)."	So be careful with that.
Avoid_Traffic.txt	Begin_Revision	0.946	### Preparing Your Drive	664	And sometimes they can take longer , especially if they involve many traffic lights or take a significant detour .	### Preparing Your Drive	719	But sometimes they can take longer , especially if they involve many traffic lights or take a significant detour .	<replace><And><1><But><1>	True	Preparing Your Drive  1. Check traffic before you leave. Many local and national government websites offer up-to-the-minute traffic data for most major roads. Checking these can give you an idea about travel times, and help you to decide whether to take an alternate route. * Useful national traffic information sites include the USDOT Federal Highway Administration’s National Traffic and Road Closure Information, and Traffic England. 2. Use online public traffic maps and traffic counts. Check the official websites of your city, county, and the department of transportation for your state for traffic information. Search on these sites for traffic maps and traffic counts, which give a general idea of when to expect congestion on the roads in particular areas. 3. Avoid construction areas. If you’ll be travelling on highways during the warmer months, there is a good chance you could encounter traffic caused by road construction. In this case, you might want to plan an alternate route. You can find out just where construction is taking place by using the local and national governmental sites that provide real-time information on roads under construction. * Some national sites with road construction information include Highways England, and the USDOT Federal Highway Administration’s National Traffic and Road Closure Information. 4. Check for sporting events and festivals. Highways near sports stadiums can become congested two hours before and two hours after games. Check your local professional teams’ schedules to see whether a match will be taking place in this time frame, and if there is one, consider alternative routes. Take similar precautions with large city festivals. 5. Sign up for a carpool. Driving with friends or co-workers during high traffic times is an excellent way to reduce traffic. By carpooling you can save money on gas while reducing pollution. Carpooling vehicles can also take advantage of usually traffic-free carpool lanes in some cities. * Ask your co-workers about setting up a carpool, or connect to onlinle carpooling networks such as Ridesharing.com or Erideshare.com. 6. Plan an alternate route. Check traffic websites, and use GPS systems and software to help you plan alternate routes. Sometimes an alternate route of city streets or state highways can get you to your destination faster than the congested road.	.

Give air plants a dose of fertilizer every four weeks. Liquid, water-soluble fertilizer with a 10-5-5 ratio is fine. * Dilute the fertilizer to one-fourth the recommended strength and mist the air plant with the solution in the morning. 2. Know when your plant needs more fertilizer. An air plant that is getting enough fertilizer will grow vigorously and have a healthy color, usually bright gray-green but this varies. * Not enough fertilizer will result in slow growth and too much fertilizer will turn the leaves brown and brittle. 3. Make sure your plant gets plenty of air. Air plants require good air circulation.	Do not place them too close to other plants, walls or furniture.
Become_a_Millionaire.txt	Begin_Revision	0.736	### The actions	42388	And the certainty of customers should not be overlooked lightly .	### The actions	42561	In addition , the certainty of customers should not be overlooked lightly .	<insert><In><1>|||<insert><addition><1>|||<replace><And><1><,><3>	True	The actions  1. Think about becoming a millionaire. Now you've done that, stop it. It's time to start doing something instead. However, do spend some time reading other millionaires' advice. Some suitable books to read include: * Thomas J Stanley, The Millionaire Next Door (2004) and Stop Acting Rich... and Start Living Like a Real Millionaire (2009) * Alexander Green, The Gone Fishin' Portfolio. 2. Stop spending and be thrifty. This is a key element of becoming a millionaire. Either you have the money in savings or you're spending it on things. You can't have both if you're aiming to become a millionaire. Most millionaires (a net worth of $1 million to $10 million) are living a very frugal and cost-effective life, without hyper-expenditure. This includes:  * Keep the cost of your residence under half a million dollars. * Don't buy a second home; rent your holiday homes instead. * Don't buy a boat. Rent one when you need it. * Buy quality clothing but don't pay ridiculous prices. A suit under $400 is about what you should pay. * Wear inexpensive watches, jewelery and accessories. * Don't collect things. * Drive a reliable but affordable car of an ordinary brand. * Avoid prestige and luxury brands. They're the same thing over-packaged and targeted at aspirationals and those with millions more than you'll probably ever get. But remember, you can have some millions if you spend wisely. * Stop equating spending with happiness. A total no-win way to think. * Stop comparing yourself to others and trying to keep up with them through spending. 3. Enjoy the finer and often free or least expensive things in life. If racing about the city in a Ferrari and living a champagne lifestyle on your wage thrills you, forget becoming a millionaire anytime soon. Becoming a millionaire means enjoying the less showy, simpler things in life, such as: * Visiting museums, art galleries, zoos, nature reserves, parks, sporting events * Entertaining friends and spending time with friends * Community volunteering and activities, being involved * Visiting the library and other civic places * Gardening, craft, painting, caring for pets, etc. * Raising money for charities and beloved causes or lending a hand * Following spiritual pursuits including thinking about the bigger picture * Spending time with family of all ages * Exercising such as jogging, walking, running, cycling and swimming * Studying, attending lectures, writing poems, etc. 4. Live beneath your means. Whether or not you choose to follow the subsequent suggestions about getting into business, living beneath your means is an important part of accumulating wealth over stuff. In order to do this realign your focus of what matters to you. What sorts of achievements and recognition do you want in life that doesn't involve consumption? 5. Consider what you're doing now. If you're in a regular, salaried job, the chances are that you're not going to become a millionaire, even if you forgo almost everything and live like a total hermit and save most of your salary. At that rate, you might be lucky to be a millionaire by the time you're bitter enough to enjoy it. And look at it this way – you're making your employer richer, not yourself. Does that feel good? This requires you to step outside of your comfort zone - are you ready for that?  * If you define yourself by a profession or trade, you're going to find it hard to let go and wander around the world of being an entrepreneur. While your trained skills can be of great importance to you in a wider context, they can hamper you in the pursuit of becoming a millionaire. Millionaire teachers and plumbers aren't as commonplace as you might like to dream. 6. Be prepared to get into business. Salaried jobs are going to be a much slower and possibly impossible way to become the millionaire you're wanting to become. A salaried job might make some CEOs into millionaires quickly but the responsibility and the potential for huge liabilities are somewhat off-putting for most people and it's a slow and not necessarily sure rise to the top of companies large enough to pay salaries in the millions. Are you prepared to sit around and wait for such a possibility, that may or may not happen, or would you rather be at the helm of your millionaire status? 7. Look at what people need, not necessarily at what you want when deciding on a business. When deciding on a business, you might be drawn to all the pretty and glamorous opportunities in the world. Things like making movies, iPods and pretty dresses. The trouble is, many people have already truly cornered those markets. However, there will always be things people need and they need them to be done well. Things like garbage disposal, energy creation, providing products to the health and dying industries, etc. These may not be as glamorous as you'd like but they're essential and noble in their own right.	People won't die without an iPod but they will die if their drinking water is either inaccessible or unclean. Choose a business that provides what people really need and be prepared to put in the effort to make your products and services either the best, the most price efficient or the most unique.

Create a budget. Stop ignoring your bills and commit to seeing how much you spend each month. Sit down and calculate the following: * Your monthly income. Add up everything: salary, wages, tips, unemployment benefits, etc. * Your fixed expenses. These are things that cost about the same every month, such as your rent/mortgage, health insurance premiums, car payment, etc. * Your discretionary spending. This spending varies depending on the month. Most of your bad spending habits will be for discretionary items. 2. Reduce the amount you spend on clothing. You can certainly look good without stopping into a store every week to buy something new. Go through your closet and find clothes in good repair. Then organize a clothes swap with your friends. * If you need to buy something new, shop at thrift and consignment stores to save money. 3. Lower your grocery bill. Everyone needs to eat, so you can’t reduce food expenses entirely. However, you can save money by buying generic label products in bulk. Clip coupons for added savings. * Instead of eating out, learn to cook at home. There are recipes for many 15-minute meals online that you can easily find, or you might buy a new cookbook. * If you want to entertain, then throw a potluck and ask every guest to bring one small dish. 4. Cut entertainment expenses. There are many free options for entertainment. All you need to do is look around. Consider the following cheap substitutes: * Rent DVDs from the library instead of going to the movies. * Check books out of the library instead of buying them at a bookstore. * Play board games with your family or friends. * Listen to music for free over the radio instead of buying CDs or downloading songs. 5. Identify when you spend. You may spend at certain times of the day. For example, you might buy a coffee early in the morning or have a drink after work each evening. You have gotten into the habit of spending money at certain times of the day. Often, you spend as a way to reward yourself. * Everyone needs their little rituals to get through the day, so you won’t cut out spending altogether.	.

Earn a college degree. As with many careers, a formal education will greatly benefit you, but the exact course of study is up to you. You may be able to find talent agent courses at some institutions, but business, marketing, film, communication, law, and public relations are all fields of study that will give you a good foundation. * These degrees do not automatically qualify you for the career, but they will give you a lot of the knowledge you need to succeed as an agent. * If you can pair any of these studies with minors such as theater, production, or acting, you’ll have a well-rounded starting place. * If you know of a specific talent agency that you want to work for, find out what college requirements they have when they hire. 2. Call talent agencies and ask about opportunities. Many talent agency jobs will not be advertised, so you may need to call and ask directly. If you know anyone in the industry, never be afraid to ask for a referral. Agencies look for people who are highly motivated, so calling shows that you take initiative. * You may have to take an unpaid or part-time position to start with, but don’t let this deter you. It’s an industry where you usually start at the bottom and work your way up. * If you call once and are turned down, wait a week or two and call again. You never know when a position is going to open up and you don’t want to miss it. 3. Get an internship with a talent agency.	Search on internship websites or call talent agencies directly to ask them what internships the offer.

Swaddle your baby in a blanket with her arms down. Colicky babies don’t just cry during feedings. Swaddling your baby will calm them down, regardless of whether they are breast or formula fed. 2. Hold your baby on her side or stomach. This will help to relax and calm her down. However, only position a baby on their backs when you them put to sleep. 3. Try singing or speaking to her. More “face time” like singing or speaking to her while you hold her will comfort her. 4. Gently swing or bounce your baby. The rocking motion may be similar to the gentle motion of being in your uterus before birth. 5. Give your baby a pacifier. Many babies will calm down by sucking on their pacifier. 6. Place a warm water bottle on your baby’s abdomen. Some mothers find this soothing for their baby. Be sure to use warm water from the tap. Never use boiling water or heat the water in a microwave. * The water should feel comfortably warm on your skin, with a temperature of no more than 102o Fahrenheit. 7. Keep in mind that colic will disappear by 4 to 5 months of age. As long as your doctor confirms that your baby is growing normally and is healthy, your baby’s colic should disappear by the time they are 5 months old. *	.

Drink plenty of water. It is especially important to stay well-hydrated if you are doing any sort of resistance (muscle building) training. One of the side effects of dehydration is a decrease in strength. If your strength is not at it's optimum level you won't be able to train effectively. * A good rule of thumb is to drink half your body weight in ounces of water. So if you weigh 160 pounds, you'll need to drink 80 ounces of water every day. Even on the days you don't train. 2. Get enough sleep. Resistance training causes tiny micro tears in the muscle fibers. As you sleep your body repairs these tears. This is the process used to build bigger, stronger muscles. If you are training you need eight hours of sleep every night. 3. Make sure you eat enough protein. Diet is of course important for all around health, but when it comes to building muscle the most important aspect is protein intake. An average amount is .8 grams per pound of body weight.	.

Let the opening and closing of your essay complement each other. The best way to do this is to include in both sections a sentence that expresses the essay's main point. The introduction and conclusion should support -- rather than conflict with -- one another by making the same coherent point(s). 2. Provide a logical and orderly sequence of thoughts within each paragraph and each section of your essay. This may mean you will have to re-order your paragraphs so that each thought grows ""organically"" out of ones that precede it. 3. Order each segment. Ask yourself why you have put segments of the essay in the arrangement you did. Be sure the arrangement does a good job of logically laying out your central points. Don't let the essay become mired in irrelevant or inconsequential verbiage. 4. Provide evidence to support your main points. The strongest evidence you can use to support your main points will be the citation of studies or scholarly texts you have researched. A lack of such evidence may result in diminished impact for your essay. 5. Do not oversimplify your argument. Don't think that citing competing facts will weaken your argument."	.

Often, patients are directed to eat more eggs and dairy. * You may also need to eat foods with different consistencies. For instance, dishes with sauces and gravies may be easier to eat, and low-fiber foods may be preferable to high-fiber options. 2. Talk about any problems eating. Treatment for myeloma can lead to significant side effects in terms of your ability and desire to eat. For instance, you may lose your appetite and/or your sense of taste, you may have trouble chewing or swallowing, and you may have trouble keeping food down or other digestion issues. In order to stay on top of any dietary concerns, mention any trouble you have eating to your doctors as soon as it develops. * There are many different treatment options regarding improved appetite and digestion. Aside from traditional medication, ask your doctor about medical marijuana if it is legally available where you live. Many people, including some with myeloma, use marijuana to improve their appetite. 3. Stock your kitchen before treatments. You will likely be warned by your medical team about treatments that may affect your ability and motivation to eat. Preceding these treatments, stock up your kitchen with foods that will be easy to prepare and consume. In particular, get plenty of whatever foods you are able to eat when you do not feel well. * Frozen dinners and ready-to-eat meals are good options to have on hand. Try to have both frozen and refrigerated options available at all times. * Make a large batch of a food you know you enjoy and store it in meal-sized portions. 4. Eat whenever you’re hungry. Especially during treatment periods, it’s important to eat to maintain your strength and rebuild damaged tissue. Unfortunately, it may be especially challenging to eat during these periods. In order to make sure you’re getting enough protein and calories, eat whenever you are inclined to do so. * In particular, get in the habit of eating every morning, as this is the time of day you are most likely to have an appetite. * Liquid protein shakes are a great option for later in the day, especially on those days you struggle to eat. *	.
Become_a_Fool.txt	Begin_Revision	0.851	## Steps	872	Rather purchase the original software belonging to a reputable anti-virus and security company .	## Steps	916	Instead , purchase the original software belonging to a reputable anti-virus and security company .	<insert><Instead><1>|||<replace><Rather><1><,><2>	True	Steps  1. Make assumptions It has been said that to assume makes an ‘ass out of you and me’. Well, nothing has changed. It does. The caution with this is that sometimes people don’t like being checked up on, and although you may have the best intentions when attempting to avoid assumption, you may end up being slapped by someone if you ask too many questions. A healthy balance between the two is recommended. Making major decisions on assumption is dangerous. People should however be more tolerant of one another when it comes to assumptions about smaller minor things. It is human nature to assume and we should be more forgiving of our brothers and sisters with this. Learn not to sweat the small stuff. Be ready to defend yourself with good reasons if someone does make an assumption about you or your life. Live a clean, transparent life of integrity that will leave little room for assumption. Don’t be quick to judge others. Make every effort to live at peace with all men. 2. Don’t read your insurance schedule and policy wording. If you have had an insurance claim declined by your insurance company, you will know that this is one of the more detrimental acts of foolishness one can commit. Being totally reliant on your broker to do this for you is foolishness. At the point of your claim, there is nothing stopping your broker from merely proving that they sent you these documents for perusal and approval to cover themselves. Read these documents thoroughly and ask many questions. This is an area where you need to be as pedantic as possible. It could save you a lot of money and disappointment in the long run. 3. Don’t have a legal eye glance over your contracts Those believing they can do this alone are somewhat foolish. Unless you have a sound knowledge of law, having a legally qualified person approve your contracts is a must. The impact of having a clause against a person’s constitutional rights in a contract for example is a sure pathway to trouble. Ask many questions. Check for ambiguities as these will always be turned in favour of the person who drafted and offered the contract. Don’t try and trick people through contractual obligations and small print. Openness, transparency and using language that is easily understood is highly recommended. Highlight areas you wish the other party to a contract to pay particular attention to by either typing the same in bold or underlining it so that you cannot be accused of ‘hiding things’ in the small print of a contract at a later stage. Get one or two trusted advisors to read over a contract prior to signing it and do not accept anything you are not satisfied with until you fully understand the impact of what you are committing to by accepting the contract. 4. Breach a contract Once your contract is signed, a sure way to drink of the cup of foolishness is to breach a contract. Sometimes, breach of contract can be a strategic move, but generally, this should be avoided. There are better ways to exit a situation if you need to than to deliberately breach a contract. The impact could turn out to be more trouble than you can handle and can see you wrapped up in expensive litigation for a time to come. 5. Over-extend yourself financially Governments that have passed National Credit Acts and have imposed strict laws surrounding borrowing and lending of money are to be commended. There are few things less stressful than being over-extended financially. People have taken their own lives over this. The shame of bad debt, judgements and asset repossessions is hurtful not only to the person who experiences it, but their loved ones too. It is just not worth it. 6. Stand surety for someone else’s debt The bible teaches that this is foolishness. Standing surety for someone else’s debt is often an emotional decision. The truth is, an emotional decision about money is usually a foolish decision. Saying ‘no’ might just help the other person to re-evaluate their needs and priorities. If you can’t afford it with honest declaration or without surety, don’t buy it. As simple as that. 7. Purchase Real Estate, Time Share or Property Fractions without physically viewing the property A saying exists – ‘In God we trust, everything else we audit’. The same should be for property or real estate prior to purchasing it. You want to physically see the bricks and mortar or the land before investing in it. Buying off plan is risky business, but this is excluded from the advice here. Many people have been caught buying non-existent real estate, fractions or have invested in time-share only to be sorely disappointed. Only use reputable companies for this kind of investment and please do visit the location if possible prior to signing on the dotted line. 8. Use the internet without the correct security / antivirus settings Want your money stolen out of your bank account? Your hard-drive infected with scary viruses? Your hard drive crashing on you at that crucial moment? If so, don’t do this. A computer accessing the internet without the correct security and anti-virus is a risk to all of us. Make sure you load a reputable anti-virus system. Try avoid the ‘free trials’ available on the internet.	Update your anti-virus regularly or buy a product that automatically updates every time you access the internet. This is a non-negotiable.

Find a unit in your area that you'd be interested in joining. The internet is a great way of doing some research, most groups have websites now. Also, take a look around State/National Parks and historical museums; a local group might sponsor an event there, which gives you the opportunity to meet many groups and see them in action. 2. Consider these important issues about different groups: * Confederate or Union (totally your preference); * Infantry, Cavalry, or Artillery (Infantry tends to have the most need for drummers, Cavalry the obvious least); * Are they family oriented or not; * Are these people you'd like to spend several weekend with?; and * What types of events do they do (battle re-enactments or more educational living histories). 3. Obtain the proper equipment. The unit you're joining may be able to help you by pointing you in the right direction or even having spare uniform bits lying around. What you want to get will depend on the unit that you join. From pre-1863, most musicians wore a musician's frock (a frock coat with piping all over the front), but this is only appropriate for some units. 4. Find a drum. Some units may have a community drum that they'll let you borrow. Some of these are very old or not completely authentic.	Cooperman, Florence, and Heritage are some of the names, but search around before committing to one.

Being negative can be really fun or it can be really awful. It depends on how you approach the round. As the negative team you can do pretty much whatever you want. The affirmative has a little circle that we call affirmative ground (the resolution), the negative has all of the ground outside of the little circle. As the negative team it is difficult to win if you don't come prepared. As the negative team you can run arguments such as Disadvantages, Kritiks, Counterplans, etc.. One big thing you should run every round on negative is Topicality, even if the affirmative team is topical. You should also have something to say about their advantages and prove they don't include all of the 5 stock issues. 2. It might seem silly to run topicality even if the affirmative team follows the resolution.	Remeber silence is compliance. So if the other team drops or fails to answer the arguments you present then they concede or agree with you. Well, atleast that is what it means within the round.

Bands like D'espairsRay and Dir en grey wore dark outfits, often with studded or spiked accessories and belts, along with drastic black make-up. 3. Hair is usually outgrown, often past the ears.

Pick up an Application for Firearms Purchaser Identification Card, or STS-33, from your municipal police department, State Police office, or registered firearms salesperson. This is the key form you'll need in order to purchase a firearm in New Jersey. You use it to purchase both handguns and long guns (shotguns, rifles, etc.) You will also need additional paperwork to file the STS-33, including: * A government issued ID, such as a passport or driver's license. * A list of 2-3 references, who will be required to fill out a questionnaire testifying that you have sound mental health and judgment. * Money, usually $60, for fingerprinting. * You can find an online version of the form here. 2. Complete the Application for Firearms Purchaser Identification Card and/or Handgun Purchase Permit Form and then make a copy of it. You'll need two of these applications. It can't hurt, as well, to make a third copy to keep for your own records. * This form will suffice for any type of gun you wish to purchase. * You will still need to apply to carry a handgun separately, and handgun purchasing licenses will run out after only 30 days unless renewed. 3. Contact your references in advance and let them know the police will be calling. The STS-33 requires you put down two character witnesses, which are the names and addresses of two people who can attest that you're in good mental condition. Be sure to call them ahead of time and ask them if they will be your references, preventing any surprised or nervous behavior that could adversely affect your application. 4. Complete a Consent For Mental Health Records Search form. This should be given to you by your local police municipality, either with the STS-33 or after you've already turned it in. This form allows for the state to perform mental health background check on you. * Make a copy of this as well, as 2 forms must be submitted. 5. Photocopy your driver's license and Social Security card. You'll need to bring the originals in with you as well, but you do not want to leave them there with the police. Once you've got this together, you're ready to finish you application. 6. Bring your paperwork, license, and at least $65 with you to your local police station. Remember that this needs to be your local municipality. When possible, it can't hurt to call ahead of time and run through your paperwork, ensuring that you have everything covered before you waltz into the station. * Bring and extra $2.00 for each handgun permit that you intend to get. * Contact your local police department for the methods of payment that they accept and for instructions on whom to make the payments to.	.

Learn from the other manga ka. This way, you can make your manga interesting. Just don't copy it completely. Learn from popular manga(s). Why are they so popular? What is the interesting part? Most of factors to make these manga(s) be popular are : * Interesting Story, this is an important part. Interesting story means more interested reader. A more intriguing story goes deep and flows in clues, or rather, bits and pieces throughout the manga. This helps grip the reader to it, and makes them want to find out more so it can all piece together. * Easy to Understand Story, clarity is number one! Whatever the manga is, no clarity means it's not understandable, readers will close your pages. If your clues and plot twists don't piece together like they should, the reader will be left puzzled and rather indignant. It doesn't have to piece together right away, so if you prolong the manga in issues and volumes, that can wait. * Nice Graphic, the artwork is the most important part of a manga. It's what catches the reader's eye, and quite a lot of effort should be put into this artwork. Manga-kas regularly worry about technicalities such as backgrounds, panel angles, and anatomy, which are styled to the artist's original form. * Exciting Panels, as the media is an art! From the background (detailed, with added effect), panel's shape (square, circle, bleeding), until the flow (up, then big, then very small). This will help your manga keep a form that is easy to follow. * Character's Personality, this will make them unique! The personality stereotypes like being brash, prone to blanking, being forgetful, being grave and serious or overly emotional, etc, will make them easy to recognize. But properly-made characters should go deeper than stereotypes. The most important part of a character is how he/she is used in the plot, and how his/her past made them how they are/were today.	But these are rather rare, and made exclusively for strangely outgoing characters. Overdoing it will annoy the reader.

Become_a_Ballet_Dancer.txt	Begin_Revision	0.76	## Steps	7318	But with the bonus comes the added risk .	## Steps	7388	However , with the bonus comes the added risk .	<insert><However><1>|||<replace><But><1><,><2>	True	"Steps  1. Body Requirements. Anybody wishing to become a ballet dancer needs to meet some requirements. 2. They need to have a strong core, back, feet, and legs,a flexible body,be a graceful person when dancing, and are relatively healthy. They should be at a healthy weight. You do not need all of these to begin ballet, but it would be helpful if you wished to become a professional ballet dancer. Dancers are strong and flexible at the same time. 3. Clothing. Having the proper clothing can be a big boost. 4. Not only does it make you look like a pro, but some items will help support you, allow you to move, and even help with certain ballet technique i.e Pointe Shoes. For many schools, the basic uniform for girls is a leotard, tights, Georgette skirt (thin cloth wrap-around skirt), soft ballet shoes (leather or canvas). Once you become more advanced, your teacher may allow you to begin wearing pointe shoes, and train to become proficient at pointework. This is a skill vital for professional ballerinas. Do not wear these before you are told as these can do serious damage to your toes, feet and ankles. A good website for UK and Ireland reader is www.dancewear2u.co.uk - they are very trustworthy and their prices are very low. They also stock some ISTD and RAD clothing. 5. Training. This will be the hardest step if you are not already familiar with the ballet world, but many people have overcome it. 6. When choosing a school, make sure that the directors are experienced, most likely having danced professionally before. See if any of their graduates have gone on to professional companies. Make sure that the directors are reasonable: there are many teachers out there who will stop at nothing to try to make their students perfect dancers. It is simply not reasonable. Being in training for a professional career is stressful; you don't want a teacher who is going to increase that stress. 7. If you wish to take your dancing further, you may like to hire a teacher to teach you privately. Nearly all big cities will have a ballet school, i.e Boston Ballet School. Enrolling in these is for the experienced and can be expensive, but will look good for your future. Just having a good teacher or two isn't going to turn you into a ballet dancer. You need to do everything properly as to minimise the risk of injury. Research how your body works in response to ballet (anatomy, etc.), imagery in ballet, and other things like that to help you get a better sense of your body. 8. Analyze lead dancers (principles, soloists) from corps de ballet members (""background dancers"" in a company) and students and see what makes them different. What do they do differently? How do they do it? Why? These and more are all questions you should ask yourself and apply. You don't have to do things single-handedly. There are tons of things you can learn from. Don't be afraid to develop your own ideas and opinions about your art form. Besides knowing these things, you also have to put it into practice. Stay after class to do this if you will. While the other people dance and you are waiting for your turn, instead of talking or drilling, ask yourself what you can do to be better, more beautiful, more artistic... whatever. Know, then apply. 9. Most importantly, you need to gain experience as a performer. Most schools have recitals in which their students can perform. If you want to take your performance level further, you may want to look into competing in solos in competitions, such as the Youth America Grand Prix. It is also helpful to train with a different teacher occasionally, perhaps in a summer workshop. Sometimes you can get different corrections or inspiration from another teacher besides your usual teacher. 10. Extra Home Training. Ballet trains your muscles in specific areas and ways, so it is important to ""cross-train"" so you don't injure yourself by being unbalanced. 11. Try yoga, swimming, pilates, hip hop, bike riding, hiking, or whatever else is fun. You need to supplement things like yoga to make you strong, but you also need acting and artistic skills because, well, it is ballet dancing. You can't go onstage and perform a bunch of tricks. Where is the art in that? You have to have feeling. Try acting in plays, art classes, gardening, etc. Even though it is good to work hard, also try to find time to rest and take a break from dancing. You don't want to get burned out. 12. Have a Good Mind.Think of how you can advance to the next level. 13. Just having good technique means nothing if no one sees you. ""Summer Intensives"" are a good place to start. These are summer ballet camps organized by major companies. You must always be willing to learn a new thing, or an old thing in a new way. Get to know your teachers. Don't be an annoying suck up, but familiarize yourself with them. And remember, no one is beneath you. If there was a more senior member who thought you to be beneath you, how would you feel? Plus, if she suddenly wanted a favor or something from you, you wouldn't give it. So don't be that person. There are some ballet competitions formed to expose dancers to the directors of major ballet schools, and performing at these could be a way to get a good scholarship to them."	Ballet is a performing art, not a competition. Just remember that... The most important thing to remember at this step is to make friends with everyone to broaden your horizons. If you must move away from your family at 15 or 16 to increase your chances in you career, do it. If you want to. At this point, things are subjective. Everything depends on your choices. Just as if you were a junior in high school, what would you be doing to, for example, become a biochemist? You'd be researching and applying to colleges, studying as much as you can, etc. It is important to be seen and get your name out there. One more thing that can help you is if you feel unsure at times, try to find inspiration!

Breathe_Deeply.txt	Begin_Revision	0.946	### Learning Basic Belly Breathing	4818	When you get the hang of deep breathing , try doing it 10 or 20 times in a row .	### Learning Basic Belly Breathing	4892	Once you get the hang of deep breathing , try doing it 10 or 20 times in a row .	<replace><When><1><Once><1>	True	Learning Basic Belly Breathing  1. Take a slow, deep breath in. Let the air completely fill your lungs, and resist the urge to exhale quickly before you've fully inhaled. It definitely takes some practice, since most of us are in the habit of taking quicker, shallower breaths instead of long, deep ones. Focus on breathing in as much as you can through your nose, which has tiny hairs that filter out dust and toxins so they can't reach your lungs. * As we go about our days, we often breathe in a quick, shallow way without being conscious we are doing so. Daily stresses distract us from being mindful of the way we are breathing. * Deep breathing will help you be more mindful of your body. Feel the air enter your lungs and fill them up. When you're concentrating on taking a deep breath, your worries are pushed aside for the time being. 2. Let your stomach expand. As you draw in a deep breath, let your stomach expand by an inch or two. The air should travel all the way to your diaphragm, causing your belly to round out as it fills. If you watch a baby sleep, you'll see that babies naturally belly-breathe; their stomachs, not their chests, rise and fall with each breath. As adults, we get conditioned to take shallow breaths instead of belly breaths. We tend to hold in our emotions and suck in our stomachs, tensing up rather than relaxing when we breathe. When you learn how to breathe properly, the tension goes away. * Lay down, stand, or sit upright as you breathe. It's more difficult to draw in a full breath if you're in a slouched position. * Place a hand on your belly, and the other on your chest, as you inhale. You can tell you're breathing deeply and properly if the hand on your belly rises out further than the one on your chest as you inhale. 3. Exhale fully. Let out your breath through either your mouth or your nose. As you breath out, pull in your belly toward your spine and exhale all of the breath in your lungs. After you exhale, take in another deep breath through your nose and continue breathing deeply. Try to exhale for twice as long as you inhale, and fully expel the air. 4. Try breathing deeply five times in a row. This immediately calms you down by slowing your heart rate and blood pressure, as well as distracting your mind from stressful thoughts. Get in a comfortable position and practice deep breathing correctly 5 times in a row. * Remember that your stomach should expand an inch or so from your body, further than your chest expands. *	Notice how your body and mind begin to feel as you get flooded with oxygen.

Take a deep breath. If you are stressed out, your body naturally tenses and sends your thoughts racing. Breathe deep and slow to avoid a lack of oxygen that can add to the problem. 2. Don't think about it. If you are constantly being yelled at or threatened, block out that voice by not thinking about it. Changing our thinking is easier said than done because it requires taking positive action in a negative scenario that if repeated will lead to a change in attitude and behavior (your behavior). Instead of obsessing about the person who is hurting you, count to 100 in your head, count sheep, count the number of things in the room, think of the names of all the United States, anything logical and unemotional that will take your mind off the situation. 3. Take action physically. Go for a walk, a bike ride or any other cardiovascular activity. Aerobic activity is proven to boost endorphins and will help you be in a better position to monitor and change your reactions to emotional predators. 4. Practice crying alone. Crying in front of the one who is harassing you will only provoke them to taunt you more or continue with their harassment. Breathing deeply and thinking of something other than the situation will prevent you from fully processing their mean words and ultimately prevent you from crying.	Try your best to wait until the situation has ended and for the antagonist to leave the room before you begin to cry.

That way, you can try small amounts of several varieties to find your favorites. * White tea comes in several varieties, and they can differ significantly in price. Silver Tip and Silver Needle are the best varieties, and often also the most popular. * Make sure that the tea you buy is packed in as airtight a container as possible. Keep it dry, cool and dark to prevent oxidation. White tea doesn't keep for years like black tea does. * White tea is by some margin the most expensive tea you can buy. Be sure to shop around to get the best deal possible.	.

Change your cat’s diet to a high protein and low calorie diet. Most people know that human diabetics have to be careful what they eat, and this is also the case with cats. The ideal diet is protein rich and carbohydrate low. Unfortunately, most general supermarket cat foods have the balance the other way around and are high carbohydrate and low protein. You'll need a cat food specifically geared for your cat's needs. * Thankfully, high protein prescription diets are made by a number of premium pet food companies, including Purina, Hills and Royal Canin. The Purina diet, DM, comes in wet and dry varieties. As long as the cat has sufficient access to drinking water, either formulation is fine. * By feeding a protein-dense diet, the amount of extraneous glucose produced is reduced, and stabilization becomes easier. Indeed, a small percentage of diabetic cats will respond to dietary treatment alone, and after eating a protein-dense diet for a couple of months, may even revert to non-diabetic status. 2. Use general meal times. Up until recently there were strict guidelines about when to feed a diabetic cat so that the meal coincided with the peak activity of the insulin. Scientists now recognize that this peak stimulates the cat’s appetite, and if food is available, he'll eat at this peak on his own. The principle is to match the main meal to peak insulin activity, which happens around 3 hours post injection. * However, it is important to know your cat is eating before giving insulin, so offer him a snack before injecting. This is because if the cat is sick and refuses to eat, if he is given a full dose of insulin there is a chance he may be overdosed and suffer from low blood sugar. Again, if your cat prefers mealtimes to grazing, time his main meal to match peak insulin activity – usually 3-6 hours post injection. * In simple terms (if you don’t ad lib feed), this means splitting your diabetic cat’s food allowance into four. Give two small snacks before each insulin injection, and the remainder in two meals, approximately 3-6 hours after the injection. A typical regime might look something like this: * 7am &mdash; snack + insulin injection * 10am &mdash; a meal * 7pm &mdash; snack + insulin injection * 10pm &mdash; a meal 3. Get regular check-ups with your vet.	Although the vet will teach you how to give insulin shots or how to monitor blood glucose, there will still be some tests that only the vet can perform. Monitoring for kidney functions, and liver functions, is included in the vet’s list when it comes to diabetes.

You want to make sure you work out both legs equally. 3. Try an upper body workout. Your upper body workout, when it comes to fencing, will revolve around your shoulders. By working out your upper body in a way that gears it toward fencing, you’ll prepare yourself for the rigors of a fencing competition. * Try a military press. * Think about chin-ups. * Do rowing exercises. 4.

Ask the doctor why your child needs the eye drops. Be clear on what eye needs what medication and how many drops should be used. It helps to understand what medical condition the eye drops are treating. You will know what to expect when you apply the eye drops. * There are many reasons why your child’s doctor could have prescribed the eye drops. Your child may have hay fever and you will have to treat you child’s itchy eyes off and on throughout the allergy season. Conjunctivitis is an infection of the tissue lining the inside of the eyelids and the sclera, the whites of the eye. You will apply the eye drops for a limited period of time, but you have to be careful not to spread the infection to your child’s other eye or to you. Glaucoma, increased pressure in your child’s eye, is a chronic disease and you likely will have to apply the eye drops for a long period of time. * Your child will start to feel better sooner if her eye(s) receive the proper treatment. Your child may be having a problem with only one eye or both eyes. She may not have the same issue in both eyes. You may have to put only one medication in one eye and two medications in the other eye. It will be easier to focus on your child’s comfort when applying the eye drops if you are comfortable with exactly what you need to do. 2. Ask the doctor what side effects the eye drops can cause. Eye drops are a medication and they can cause bad reactions, including an allergic reaction, in your child. You want to recognize the signs so that you can stop the eye drops as soon as possible. * The symptoms from an allergic reaction can have a lot of overlap with the symptoms from a bad reaction. Your child may experience redness, itching, burning, and blurry vision. These are symptoms you child may be having already from her illness; suspect a problem when your child’s symptoms get worse instead of better as time passes. Your doctor will tell you about the specific side effects the eye drops may cause. If you have any concerns about how your child is reacting to the eye drops, call your doctor. She can determine if your child needs a different type of medication. 3. Inform the doctor about your child’s other medications and her drug allergies. Tell her about all the prescription and over-the-counter medications your child is taking currently. Any medication can interact poorly with the eye drops. Your child’s drug allergies is important information for your child’s doctor to have when she is prescribing the eye drops. 4. Ask if you child needs to stop wearing her contact lenses. Your child may be old enough to wear contacts, but she may still need your help with the eye drops. Follow the doctor’s instructions. * A general rule is that you can have your child remove her soft contacts and keep them out for 15 minutes after using preservative-free eye drops. She will have to wear her glasses for several days if the eye drops contain a preservative. If your child wears hard contacts, she can use eye drops with or without a preservative and still keep in her contacts. 5. Ask the pharmacist when the eye drops must be discarded. Every time you use the eye drops from a mullt-dose bottle there is a risk of contamination. This could lead to an eye infection in your child. * The preservatives used in eye drops discourage the growth of bacteria after the bottle is opened, but there is a limit. A multi-dose bottle should not be used longer than 4 week. Write the day and month you opened the bottle on the label to remind you to throw away the eye drops. * Preservatives are not used in the eye drops contained in single-use vials. These eye drops should be discarded immediately after use; do not save any of remaining fluid for the next dose. 6. Inspect the label and the eye drops. Read the medicine label to check the instructions and the expiration date. Shake the bottle and draw up the medication into the dropper to look for any changes the fluid’s appearance. * The instructions on the label should be the same as what your child’s doctor told you during the office visit. * Do not use the eye drops if the expiration date has passed. Do not risk prolonging your child’s recovery time by using medication which may not be at full strength. * Shaking makes the medication uniform throughout the bottle. Discard the eye drops if you see any crystals forming or if the medication has changed colors. These changes suggest the eye drops have been contaminated. You should be able to examine the eye drops through the clear plastic of the single-dose vial. 7. Wash your hands before touching the bottle. You want your hands to be free of germs when you are touching the bottle and applying the drops to your child’s eye(s). Contamination of the eye drops and unintentionally causing an infection in your child is always a concern. 8. Choose a room that is quiet and well-lit. When the time comes, it will be easier on both you and your child if the eye drops are applied without distractions for your child and with a lot of light for you to see. * A room filled with her toys and with the TV or music blaring will make you child want to move around or look all over the place. Your child’s is already a little afraid. Do everything you can to help keep her calm. 9. Talk to your child if she is old enough. She may be more cooperative if she knows what to expect. Tell her the eye drops will make her feel better in the end, but that drops may make her eyes sting or make her vision blurry for a short time. Do some playacting to get her familiar with how you will apply the eye drops. * Show your child the medicine bottle. Explain how you will take out a dropper. Make believe you are putting eye drops in your own eyes or your partner’s eyes first. Then, make believe you are doing it to your child. Praise everyone, especially your child, for staying calm. * You can put a drop on the back of your child’s hand to let her see what it feels like. But, you want to be careful not to touch anything with the tip of the dropper. 10. Place the medicine bottle/vial on a clean tissue. Once you have drawn up the medicine into the dropper, you want to free up your hand.	.

Cleaning away any excess medication makes the process less messy. 5. Press on your child’s inner eye for 1 minute. You want to press gently on the eye near your child’s nose. This step can prevent the medication from becoming systemic and going throughout your child’s entire body. * Some children will not tolerate this pressure and it is best not to force the issue. * Your pressure is meant to block your child’s tear duct and to prevent the eye medication from becoming systemic. The medication in the eye drops is meant to treat your child’s eye only. It is absorbed by the thin layers covering your child’s eye.	Tears flow out of it to lubricate the eye. But, the eye drops can flow into the tear duct; the small blood vessels in there can carry the medication to other parts of the body.

Get a blanket or towel to wrap your child. You can keep arms and legs from flying everywhere or stop your child from trying to run away from you. It will help if you have a partner who will help keep your child calm. * This technique works best if your child is younger than 3 years old. But, you still can see if your slightly older and upset child will give it a try. * Swaddling is known to calm infants. A small child will wiggle less and may find the light pressure comforting, especially if your partner is cuddling her as well. 2. Clean your child’s eye. Use a tissue, cotton ball, or cotton swab moistened with warm water. Wipe gently from near the nose towards the ear. * An extra layer of pus or hardened eye discharge in and around the eye may prevent the eye drops from being absorbed by the superficial tissue layers of the eye. 3. Position your child and wait for her to close her eyes. It is likely your young or nervous, older child will not be very cooperative. You may have to try several positions. Wrapping your child in the blanket should not prevent you from getting your child into position. * You can have your partner cradle the child while she is lying flat on her back. * Have your child in a seated position with her head tilted back. Your partner may need to hold your child’s head in this position, gently. * If you are alone, sit on the floor with your child on your lap facing you. After you bend your knees, your thighs become a cradle. Ask your child to lean back or lie her back so that her head is resting on your knees. Both of your hands are now free. 4. Place the eye drop in the corner of your child’s closed eye. Use the corner closest to the nose. Make sure you do not touch your child’s eye, eyelashes, or face. * This does not work as well as when you place the eye drops in your child’s lower eyelid, but you there is no other option when your child is young or very upset. 5. Tell your child to open her eyes. Normal blinking will let the eye drops flow into the eye. If she is too afraid to open her eye, rub her eyelids gently to bathe the eye. Use a clean tissue to wipe away any excess medication around the eye. * Excessive blinking or tight closing may force medicine out of her eye. Help your child to follow your instructions as much as she can. * The eye drops that have drained from your child’s eye are wasted. Cleaning away any excess medication makes the process less messy. 6. Press on your child’s inner eye for 1 minute. You want to press gently on the eye near your child’s nose. This step can prevent the medication from becoming systemic and going throughout your child’s entire body. * A young or nervous child may not tolerate this pressure, but it is best not to force the issue. * Your pressure is meant to block your child’s tear duct and to prevent the eye medication from becoming systemic. The medication in the eye drops is meant to treat your child’s eye only. It is absorbed by the thin layers covering your child’s eye.	Tears flow out of it to lubricate the eye. But, the eye drops can flow into the tear duct; the small blood vessels in there can carry the medication to other parts of the body.

First you need to set up a cage before you even bringing a chinchilla home! Make sure it is in a quiet area that is well-lighted but NOT IN FRONT OF A WINDOW!The direct sun maybe too hot for your chinchilla! In the cage there should be a food bowl(made of something other then plastic, ceramic is best.)a water drinking bottle, a sleeping house(wood or other eatable substance NOT PLASTIC) 2. Make sure the cage bars aren't so far apart the chinchilla can stick his head threw IF HIS HEAD FITS THREW HE CAN FIT HIS WHOLE BODY AND ESCAPE! 3. always have food for just chinchillas and timothy hay NEVER ALPHALFA! 4. refill drinking water daily. 5. remove soiled hey and bedding from cage each day. 6.	.

Provide a suitable home. Chinchillas should be kept in cages. Since they are extremely active, make sure you buy a large cage (3x3x3 is suggested). 2. Make sure the cage has multiple levels so they can climb and jump and have fun. Some cages have a wire bottom, and this is not preferred, as it is best for them to stand on a solid floor. A cage with a floor that is part wire and part solid would be acceptable. 3. Make sure the cage bars aren't so far apart that the chinchilla can stick his head through them. If his head fits through the bars, his whole body will fit through them and he will escape. 4. Cover the bottom of the cage with high quality bedding. They also need a hiding space so they can feel safe and secure. 5. Provide healthy bedding. Never use cedar or pine shavings as bedding, as the phenols are very strong and cause serious respiratory, skin, coat and liver problems. Try to only use Kiln dried shavings or Carefresh. 6. Lift your chinchilla like you would lift a kitten. Slide your hand under the chinchilla's belly and place your other hand on top of the chinchilla. Use the hand under the chin to support its hind legs and bum so it feels secure. Don't hold the chinchilla too tightly but do remember that they can be squirmy, so you need to hold them firmly. 7. Provide good quality hay. Your chinchilla should always have a supply of timothy hay or second cut local (you can feed them small amounts of alfalfa, but not to much because it could cause foaming at the mouth). 8. Only feed your chinchilla Chinchilla Pellets. Don't buy the kind of food with little treats in it. 9. Feed them only infrequent snacks of dried fruit or nuts, but make sure that they are unsalted. 10. Refill the drinking water daily. The algae that grows in their water can cause liver problems, severe diarrhea, or kill them. 11. Remove soiled hay and bedding from the cage every day. 12. Wash the cage with hot water. It is generally suggested that you use no soap or chemicals, but if you mix a tiny amount of bleach with the hot water and swish it around the cage's plastic pan and then clean it thoroughly with hot water and then let it air dry, it is a good way to kill most of the bacteria that can harm your chinchilla. 13. Give your chinchilla a dust bath for 10-15 minutes anywhere from daily to twice a week. Too much will cause dryness.	.

For example, you might need to be confident and assertive at work, but enjoy being ladylike at home. Or, you might be wild and crazy at home, but prefer to be ladylike in public. How you break it down is completely up to you. * Talk and act like a lady especially in the presence of a man. A lady never engages in conversation that includes language or gestures of profanity or language or gestures that carry sexual overtones in the presence of a man or gentleman. * In an effort to say the right things, think positive and realize a better thought or response to, ""whether or not the glass is half empty or half full"", is always that the glass is half full. * Don't be a complainer, be a ""doer"". Complaining and talking about what you want to do or what you plan to do and never do it, can get to be annoying. In other words, don't sound like a broken record. If you need help ask for help or suggestions from someone who can help you solve it. Write it all out, or talk it out with someone who can help put it all into a good and positive perspective. Doing something about what ever problem you may have shows spunk and makes you feel better and gives you a sense of empowerment. Don't be afraid to give yourself credit when it is due.*Confidence is a good tip when being ladylike. Stand up tall, and show the world you are beautiful and that nothing will bring you down! * If you are a virgin stay that way most lady-like women are ones that men respect and women want to be."	.

Discipline is Key. Stop believing in modern upbringing without punishment. There is nothing wrong with talking and analyzing. But there is also nothing wrong with traditional values and discipline. It is a scale of grey to navigate through, not a truth in black or white. 2. Establish a clear set of house rules. Your standards will be passed on to your child. All children and teens can benefit from a behavioral chart. Talk this over with your spouse and then post it for example on the kitchen wall. Then inform your child about the (new) rules at a family meeting. Inform them what will happen if they do not obey the rules. 3. Establish a clear set of academic achievement standards. Do not accept anything but A’s. Your child coming home with a B is a major problem. Anything below a B is unacceptable. Inform your child early on what will happen when they don’t live up to the set standards. 4. Enforce a policy of ZERO TOLERANCE for first time offenses. There are no mistakes or accidents. Your child has the power to control their own destiny. 5. If your child argues and refuses, take the conflict now, because your child will thank you later on in life.	Always punish this quickly and severely.

Aim for a tank with per frog. While you can keep African dwarf frogs in smaller areas, the water gets dirty too quickly. Plus, this much space gives each frog enough room to move around. * Pick a tank that has a filtration and aeration system, as the frogs absorb some oxygen from the water and having these systems helps increase the level of oxygen in the water. * Make sure to get a tank with a secure lid, as the frogs can jump out. 3. Choose a shallow tank with or less of water. While these frogs stay in water all the time, they actually don't swim all that well. A shallower tank makes it easier for them to get to the surface when they need to breathe. * Of course, you can get a deeper tank and only fill it up to this height, too. *	.

Being an alpha is difficult because you have to live up to everyone's standards and accomplish even more in a small period of time. But if you know how to manipulate and live freely then you've already done step number one and your one step closer to being that alpha bad girl you know you are. 2. Being bad doesn't mean you have to be rude. An alpha bad girl is a bitch at times, but overall she just wants to have fun and go out every night and everyday. 3. Drama follows you everywhere you go and with everything you do. She always needs to be the star of conversations and the center of the universe before anyone else ever gets the chance. 4. Get out there and be noticed. An alpha bad girl is an eye catching jaw dropper and loves the confidence she has. She is most popular and feeds off of her social life and the people she leads. 5. You don't have to be the prettiest girl in the world or the skinniest to be an alpha bad girl. Your confidence is what'll make you the most beautifully striking bad girl around. 6. Do random things that are interesting and fun so other people around you will want to be with you every second. If you have a clique or want one then you'll need to make a lot of friends but only keep 3 or 4 in your inner exclusive circle.	It happens.

Before you begin a fairly challenging process of personal development, stop to make sure your goals are realistic and timely. Realistic means a number of things; make sure they actually are short-term, and are not ambitious. It's okay to have ambitious goals, but for an ambitious goal, you need simpler short-term goals. Timely means that they have a set time. This is where most goal setters fail and procrastinators succeed. Procrastinators will often say ""I will get it done,"" but by simply adding on a time and keeping a promise ""I will get it done by 8:00 on Tuesday or I'm not watching Matlock."" The goal automatically becomes more realistic. 2. Keep your goals specific, especially when they're short-term. ""Get good grades in school"" is not specific, neither is ""Get good grades in 2nd semester Chemistry."" Remember, these are short-term goals, be specific: ""On Tuesday, from 8-10 pm, study and complete the homework for Chemistry."" In this example, each short-term goal of studying and completing homework builds up to a larger goal of receiving good grades. 3. Keeping promises is very important. Not just to others, but yourself. Make sure that you are specific when setting your goals."	Lay down the law, buckle down and get them done.

There are numerous things that make guests happier while others cause their happiness levels to decrease. In fact, if the happiness level is low enough, the guest will turn into a vandal and break benches and lamps in your park (which in turn will affect other guest's happiness level). Sometimes it is not easy to keep the guests happy, but if you follow these tips you will have an idea on how to manipulate your guests' happiness. * Guests don't like things that are too expensive. So, if you see people thinking ""I'm not paying that much to go on/Buy [whatever]"" decrease the price of the attraction immediately. If your price is good, you will see guests thinking ""[Whatever] Is a really good value"". * Make your park look nice. Things like Scenery and Theming cause guests to think ""The scenery here is wonderful"" which boosts their happiness. Also, be sure to put music on some rides. This also makes guests happier. * Be sure to hire some handyman, especially when guests are thinking ""This path is disgusting"". Assign specific areas for the handymen to patrol and guests will hopefully will now think ""This park is really clean and tidy"" which boosts their happiness. * Hire some entertainers. Whenever a guest passes an entertainer, his/her happiness level increases. Place entertainers near the front gate to keep the guests who want to leave (due to their low happiness level) longer in park. Also, place the entertainers in the queue lines because after waiting a long time in line guests get angrier. * Keep your queue lines small. When guests think ""I've been standing in line for [whatever] for ages"" their happiness drops. They even leave the line if they wait too long. * Things like hunger, thirst, bathroom, and nausea also affect the guests' happiness. Here are some things that might cause one of those things to increase/decrease. * Guest's nausea mostly increases when he/she rides a ride that has a high nausea rating. Nausea is also increased (a tiny bit) by eating food. If the nausea level is too high, the guest will throw up. Usually vomiting decreases guest's nausea level. Nausea level is also decreased when the guest sits down or drinks a drink. * Guest's Thirst increases mostly when he/she eats food. The thirst level also increases with the nausea level. After drinking a drink, usually guest's thirst level and nausea level decrease. However, the bathroom level increases. Best places to place drink stalls are near a food stall and near the exit of the nauseous ride. * It will also be a good idea to place bathrooms all over the park. Guest's Bathroom level increases when he drinks a drink. * Guest's hunger increases over-time. Since eating food also increases nausea level, place the food stalls away from nauseous rides. * If the guest's happiness is desperately low you can rename him/her to Melanie Warn. This will boost guest's happiness and energy to maximum. * When building your park, leave the back side (the farthest from the entrance) empty, so you can build other rides there. * Be sure to build new rides as they are available. *"	This can be done by clicking park entrance and then clicking buy land icon.

Talk to your doctor about how much magnesium you should consume each day. This amount varies based on your age and gender, but in general males should not consume more than 420 mg a day and females should not go over 320 mg. * Always talk to your doctor before giving magnesium supplements to children. 2. Choose a magnesium supplement that contains magnesium citrate. This form of magnesium provides a better absorption rate than the less expensive magnesium in an inorganic oxide form. 3. Look for signs that you are not getting enough magnesium. If your lack of magnesium is only a short term condition, you most likely won’t see any symptoms.	These symptoms include:

Talk to your doctor about any medications you are taking. Some medications can be affected by taking magnesium, or may affect your body’s ability to absorb the magnesium supplements you take. These medications include: * Diuretics. * Antibiotics. * Bisphosphonates, such as those that are prescribed for osteoporosis. * Medications used to treat acid reflux. 2. Take your magnesium supplement at the same time as you take your other vitamins to ensure maximum absorption. Taking Vitamin C with your magnesium may help your body absorb the supplement more efficiently. * Magnesium and calcium work together to build strong bones and teeth. * Magnesium activates enzymes in our bodies that help with the absorption of other vitamins such as B1, B2 and B6. 3. Consider taking vitamin D with your magnesium supplement. Some studies suggest that taking vitamin D, or getting vitamin D by spending time in the sun, can help your body to process magnesium. * You can eat vitamin D rich foods, like tuna, cheese, eggs, and fortified cereals. * You can also absorb vitamin D by spending time out in the sunshine. 4. Avoid consuming certain minerals when trying to absorb magnesium more efficiently. Some minerals will fight with magnesium to be absorbed by your body. Because of this, you should avoid taking the following minerals at the same time that you take your magnesium supplement, if you are having a hard time absorbing magnesium. * Iron * Phosphorus * Manganese * Copper * Calcium 5. Take your magnesium supplement on an empty stomach if you are having problems with absorption. Sometimes the food in your stomach can interfere with your body's ability to absorb magnesium. *	.

Don't be mute. Whenever a new girl is brought into a group whether she is drop dead gorgeous or not, if she is TOO quiet she will come across as snobby. Don't be afraid to jump into the conversation and add your two cents. Take an interest in the friends. Showing that you want to get to know them shows that you are open and you care. 2. Learn to tease and be teased. Guys break each others balls. It's just the way they interact with each other, so chances are they may break yours a bit. This is a test of sorts to see if you are ""cool"" or not. In the friends' minds, they are not dating you, so they are not so worried about pleasing you. So they will probably tease you to see how you handle it. The best thing to do in this situation is agree and deflect. If you are really witty, you can fire back but be warned if you do this you are setting the standard for the relationship. 3. If banter and firing back is not your thing, then just agree and make it absurd somehow. If they make a comment about your outfit like ""What's up with that top? It looks like something my eighth grade girlfriend wore."" Then just agree ""I know that is exactly what I was going for. Actually I borrowed it from my eighth grade cousin. That is so awesome that you noticed!"" This really leaves them nowhere to go and shows you get the joke. 4. In a group there may be one or two asshole friends, if this is the case everyone else in the group probably already knows it. So just be as calm as you can and roll with the punches. People like this live for getting a rise out of the other person so don't give them the satisfaction. If you stick around long enough and it continues someone will probably come to your aid or you may have to fire back but deal with that when the time comes. Keep your cool as long as you can. 5. Don't be the dancing monkey. Sometimes guys friends will try to get you to DO things under the guise of you being accepted. Now somethings are harmless. If they invite you to do a shot with them that's a good thing. If they want to feed you 10 shots, that's a bad thing. Maybe they want you to go get some other guys to buy you drinks to give to them. 6. Know that it's okay to say no. While it may seem cool to pull these things off, and if you can go for it, but don't be afraid to say no. Again use the deflection. If they are trying to get you wasted they are hoping you make a fool of yourself. So you can refuse drinks by saying something like, ""If you guys get me too drunk your buddy won't be getting laid tonight."" And if the guy you are dating is any kind of man he WILL help you out. If they say they have some kind of ritual that seems weird make someone else do it first. If they do then you know it's on the level. It's okay to say you thought they were trying to pull a fast one. 7. Don't be a know-it-all. Now this is a general rule of social interaction but I feel it needs to be stated. NO ONE likes a know it all or a one-upper. You know the person who is always correcting everyone or who always has a better story. It's okay to show your intelligence and share stories but just avoid correcting people or starting your sentences with ""You think that's cool? Well this one time..."" You know at least one of these people so if you are ever unsure ask yourself, ""would my know-it-all/one-upper friend say or do this?"" If the answer is yes then DON'T. 8. Go with the flow unless you are uncomfortable. Now every group of friends is into different things and they may not be your cup of tea but just try to go with it. Look at it as a new experience. At some point you are going to want your boyfriend to do something he doesn't want to so be fair. Now if it is something that makes you uncomfortable like selling or doing drugs or gang bangs or something like that, then that probably says something about the guy you are dating and that's another story."	No one likes a whiner. The friends will not want you to come on anymore of their outings. So keep your complaints to yourself and try to make the best of it.

Keep your head up and look people in the eye. While walking, it is always important to maintain a definitive upright posture. This may feel awkward or overpowering to you when you first practice it but keep trying. Relax the muscles in your face to the point where you have a natural, pleasant expression permanently engraved there. When your eyes come in contact with another person's, nod and smile subtly and with great joy shining forth. Don't worry about the other person's reaction and don't overdo it. 2. Make an enormous effort to remember people's names when you meet them for the first time. Repeat the person's name when stating your name to that person will help you to remember it better. For example: ""Hi Jack, I'm Wendy""). Follow through with small talk about the weather or the day of the week. During this talk, repeat the person's name. Repeat it once more when you say goodbye. It is not just about helping you to remember that person; it is about the reality that the more you say a person's name, the more that person will feel that you like them and will warm to you. 3. Be interested in people. If you meet a new acquaintance, for example a coworker, a classmate, a friend of a friend, etc. find out about their immediate family and interests. Be sure to ask after the names of family members and remember them. Also ask after their particular interests in life. These two topics will ensure much better small talk than just harping on about school or work. Most people don't like to think about those things at social occasions unless they have to. Even if it is about networking, you should understand fully the worth of taking a break from talking shop. 4. Orientate topics toward the audience. This means taking into account topics that interest those around you, even if you are not so keen on them. If you are in a sporty crowd, talk about last night's game or the meteoric rise of a new team. If you are amongst a group of hobbyists, draw out their hobbies and make remarks related to fishing, knitting, mountain climbing, movies etc. Nobody expects you to be an expert - it is your level of interest and willingness to engage in topics that makes you an interesting person to be around. Let others do the explaining. If someone mistakenly thinks you know more about the topic, be genuine and simply say that your knowledge is limited but that you are hoping they can help you to learn some more. 5. Don't be a gossip. If you are talking with someone or you are talking in a group of people, and up pops the subject of another person in a none too polite way, be the magnanimous one and mention something you like about that person. Hearsay is the most powerful tool in gaining charm because it is always viewed as 100% sincere. 6. Never lie. A lie is something you say for which there is some direct evidence somewhere out there that contradicts it. If you tell Mary that you like Jane and Billy that you don't like Jane, Mary and Billy will talk and your reputation will be ruined. No one will believe a word you say. Besides, charming people just do not do this; it is most unbecoming. You must think and act the same way that you wish to feel. 7. Always enhance the truth to create a heightened level of well-being. There is a football field between lying and embellishing or complimenting to raise self-esteem. If you notice that someone is putting a lot of effort into something, compliment it, even if you feel that there is room for much improvement. If you notice that someone has changed something about themselves (haircut, manner of dress) compliment it regardless of what you really think of it. It you notice someone boasting too much, simply tell them how great you think they are and that you recognize they do a lot of good for the world. Always look into your heart and speak from there. That way, you will say things that matter and carry meaning. Try it. 8. Let people know quickly that they impress you. If you like something or someone, find a creative way to say it and say it immediately. If you wait too long, it may be viewed as insincerity and badly timed, especially if others have beaten you to it. If you don't like something or someone, and you cannot bring yourself to speak from your heart as suggested in the step above, refrain from saying anything. if you are asked directly, be charming and deflect the question with a very general compliment that you genuinely do feel about the person or the situation. If you don't have an opinion on something that other people like, be generally accepting. After all, it is no skin off your nose to join in with the crowd in such a case. 9. Be gracious in accepting compliments. Refuse to feel that the compliment is being made without genuine intent. Even when someone makes a compliment out of contempt, there is always a germ of jealous truth hiding in their own heart. Be effusive in accepting; go beyond a mere ""thank you"" and enjoin this with ""I'm really glad you like it""; or ""It is so incredibly kind of you to have noticed""; or ""I feel really warm and fuzzy after you noticed my efforts"". These are ""compliments in return"". 10. Avoid backhanding a compliment. There is nothing worse to a person complimenting than to receive the response ""Oh well I wish I was as ______ as you/that situation."" That is tantamount to saying, ""No I'm not what you are saying I am and your judgment is wrong."" 11. Never laugh at your own jokes. That smacks of poor taste. The joke ought to stand alone. You can smile generously. And don't worry if no one else laughs at your jokes. Sometimes people just don't hear or get a joke and it is as embarrassing for them to miss the punchline to have to own up to this as it is for the person giving the joke seeking to wind up a jovial response. 12. Never over-explain anything. To do this is to labor a point. Unfortunately, it simply confirms a lack of self-esteem in that you do not trust that others have ""understood your point""."	People will listen to you when you cut out unnecessary explanations and force them to be active listeners. Trust that your listeners can put two and two together and they will find you irresistible.
Be_a_Surfer_Girl.txt	Begin_Revision	0.893	### Get the look	23324	But remember , sand and nail varnish do n't mix .	### Getting the Look	23414	Also remember , sand and nail varnish do n't mix .	<replace><But><1><Also><1>	True	"Get the look  1. Remember that the whole surfer look is one of carefree casualness. Nothing's too done, so don't spend ages on your hair - leave it be, put minimal make up on (a bit of mascara, eyeliner and lip gloss is fine) and wear casual clothes. 2. Try to get surfer girl hair. It is not true that all surfers have blonde hair because it is bleached from the sun. Brunettes don't go blonde just because they spend time in the sun. However, surfers do have lighter hair than others because they spend a lot of time in the sun and saltwater makes your hair lighter - think Fabiola Gatti. A good way to achieve this look is to mix one part of sea salt with three parts of water, and spritz on your hair using an old hairspray bottle. It will give you that care-free ""just surfed"" look and is a good, natural alternative to dye if you can't actually go surfing all the time. If your hair is naturally wavy or curly, embrace it - surfer hair is typically tousled. If it's naturally straight, after towel drying hair curl it in rags/french plait it and leave it overnight and it will be wavy by morning. There are some products on the market that boast 'surfer hair' so try these out and see what they do for. And also, if you have darker hair, or hair that's a little more thick, then you should try putting it in a braid, or braids. Or put you hair in a bun, or a side ponytail, or just leave it down. 3. Get a tan. It's essential for that laid-back, carefree look and looks flattering on almost everyone as it is an automatic slimmer and makes you look healthier and radiant. Real surfers have real beach tans, but of course if you live in a climate where you need to wear a wet suit, it's very easy to get that unflattering 'wet suit tan' where past the neck you're completely white! Additionally you might live in a cooler climate not near the beach, or it might be winter, or you may sunburn instead of tan. Here, the only solution is sunless tanning, either through a sunbed (not recommended), or faking it. Make sure you use a good quality tanner, exfoliating beforehand and moisturizing afterwards to prolong it. And if you have darker skin, then you don't have to tan, unless you still want to. But your skins already perfect for it. 4. Sort out your wardrobe. Your clothes may include surf brands like Billabong and Roxy, but you shouldn't wear only surfing brands. Real surfers don't always live in beach brands, it can be too expensive and they're not always practical. The usual outfit for a surfer girl is board-shorts and a bikini, but for school or during cool weather, surf-inspired tops and jeans are a good look. Also, many surfer girls are bohemian in style and opt for the 'boho chic' look (see Sienna Miller, Mary-Kate Olsen for ideas), which means gypsy inspired clothes, long skirts, maxi dresses, floral prints, lots of bangles and jewellery, and layered clothing. Girls in Hawaii usually wear lots of beach coverup dresses. What lots of girls wear are jean shorts with any tank, tee, or hoodie, with a neutral colored leather belt, trucker hat, and Vans or converse slip-ons, or flip flops. While at the beach, wear a long pareo (sarong) tied loose and low around your hips. You can also use this item as a beach blanket or wrap up in it if you are cold. Always bring a pareo with you to the beach. You should always have: * plenty of denim shorts * a few pairs of jeans * lots of basic tank tops and tees * a few sundresses in floral prints or bright colors * 2-3 cardigans * 2-3 hoodies * 2 pairs of cargo pants * flattering bikini * flip-flops 5. Wear jewellery such as bracelets made of hemp, rope, string and seashells, and necklaces made of the same materials or rock pendants. You'll want to wear these 5 to 10 bracelets at a time so that they stack up your wrist. Bonus points if you get bracelets that can be worn in the water. Just note, you will get tan lines from them. 6. Paint your toenails a bright color so your feet look nice - remember they'll be bare on the beach. Most surfers paint their nails. Good colors are bright colors! Teal, aqua, orange, red, hot pink, and sunshine yellow."	It gets scraped off really quickly.

Boil_Eggs.txt	Begin_Revision	0.904	## Tips	10803	But , this also makes fresh eggs more difficult to peel .	## Tips	10924	However , this also makes fresh eggs more difficult to peel .	<replace><But><1><However><1>	True	"Tips  * The egg will take longer to reach the desired state if you are at a high altitude, use larger eggs, boil several eggs at once, use cold eggs, or use cold water. * If you want French oeuf a la coque (""from the shell""), where the inside remains semi-liquid throughout, let the eggs sit for only 2-3 minutes. * Soft-boiled eggs generally aren't peeled. An opening is made on one end and the inside is spooned out while leaving the rest of the shell intact. * Fresh eggs are less prone to cracking because they have a low pH in the white, causing it to adhere to the inner shell membrane, essentially ""sealing"" it together."	To remedy this, you can add a teaspoon of baking soda to a quart of water when cooking (which raises the pH and reduces adhering) but it might make the eggs taste slightly more sulfuric.

Notice the physical signs that you're suffering from stress. If you're trying to soldier on in the face of all too much happening at this time of the year, it's important to recognize the signs so that you're able to heed them. Some of the physical signs to watch for include: * Exhaustion that can't be fixed with a night's proper sleep. This could be result of not enough sleep mounting up over several months and finally hitting you with a whammy. You know that the tasks upon tasks you volunteer for have consequences, but you aren't able to stop! * Lack of energy. You can't face the thought of having to make Christmas dinner or buy Hanukkah gifts; decorating for Kwanzaa makes you want to go into a tailspin. All you want is to rest. 2. Notice the mental signs that you're suffering from stress. Apart from having absolutely no energy to do things you normally do without batting a lash, you may be feeling irritable, pessimistic, or depressive. These are mental signs you're coping with too much stress. * Irritability. Everything irritates you, and you don't know why. Unfortunately, this means you've forgotten to see the charm of your life, and you've started imagining that work's getting harder and your kids more demanding, forgetting the joys and only seeing the hassles. * Lack of resilience. Your boss criticizes one small detail in the paper you've spent months getting ready in order to free up time for the holiday break. You fall apart, sobbing. She looks at you like you're from outer space, and you begin to think she's got a point. * Poor memory. You've lost the list of Kris Kringle names somewhere, and you can't find your Santa costume from last year. Loss of memory might be infuriating but it's also protective. It's a suggestion to slow down big time. * Negative feelings. You're already planning to be disappointed by Christmas dinner or the New Year's party. Every other year has been a washout, so this one will be too. Oh, why even try? you start to wonder. You're setting yourself up for disappointment. * Feeling down, feeling the blues or depressed. An inability to shake off the blues is a warning sign that stressors are getting to you. This is one step removed from negative feelings, which will also accompany feeling down but may also involved feeling like giving up or even suicidal thoughts. You need immediate help. 3. Give yourself a break. This time of year can fluster even the most unflappable. If you're responsible for the majority of holiday season preparations, you're under a lot of pressure. Despite the fun moments you sometimes share, it's likely that you're overloaded. If you've forgotten to take care of your own needs amid this, it's not surprising that you're feeling stressed. Some of the things you might benefit from include: * Blocking out several hours every few days for rest. This is you-time and it does not involve flipping through magazines planning Christmas lunch or New Year's Eve cocktails. This is time to shut your eyes and put your feet up. Do anything other than what's expected of you. * Treating yourself to a massage or a spa visit. Amid all the chaos, seek some serenity. (Men, you're allowed to go to the spa, too, although mani/pedis are strictly optional.) * Taking time out to chat with a friend or two. Share your ideas for making it through the holiday season with greater ease. You might even help one another with babysitting arrangements or sharing tasks. * Visit your place of worship or spiritual spot more often than usual. Take time to pray, meditate or sit in a state of silence and peace. Allow the peacefulness to wash over you and remember the spirit of the season. 4. Restore your sleep. It may be the holiday season but that's no reason for feeling like you're a Grand Prix driver minus the fuel. It's a vicious cycle: the less you sleep, the more sleep you need; the more sleep you need, the less time you have to do what you feel you need to do. * Start going to bed at a time that will ensure 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep every night. If things aren't done, they can be done tomorrow or not at all. Trying to juggle too many responsibilities will eventually crush your optimism as well as your ability to get them done. * Ask your significant other for help. Tap your husband, wife, or partner to help you, so that you can catch more sleep. If you ask them in a kind, loving way, you're more than likely to be met with eagerness. 5. Eat well. Don't devastate your energy levels by starving yourself over the holiday season. Stay away from sugary, fatty and unhealthy snacks that can take the place of healthier food. While it's fine to indulge on occasion, don't use the holidays as an excuse to stop eating well.  * Changing the way you eat as a reaction to the stress of the holiday season might seem like a way to make you feel better, but this can lead to weight gain. This can cause more stress and hurl you into another vicious cycle. * Eat three healthy meals a day and keep most of your snacks healthy. Focus especially on vegetables and proteins. Indulging occasionally is fine. * Eating less? Some people respond to stress by not eating altogether. This is hard on the body as well, depleting you of much-needed energy. Indeed, you might take in so few calories that you cannot maintain your energy during the day, which is not helpful to your health. 6. Watch your alcohol intake. Alcohol is often relied upon to ease stress during the holidays. One or two drinks a few times a week might be ideal for this purpose. More than this can increase your stress, cause you to put on weight and can cloud your judgment, making things seem more negative and overwhelming than they actually are. * For events such as New Year's Eve, let yourself have a glass or two of the very best wine or sparkling drinks instead of drinking to get drunk. You deserve the far better experience. * At the same time, let yourself unwind after a busy day. Have a glass of wine with dinner, or a hot toddy an hour or two before bed. If it helps you unwind, go for it. 7. Stop imagining that the holiday season is about being ""perfect"". A lot of stress you put yourself through comes from trying to match the perfect standard shown in magazines, TV, and other fanciful media. Perfection in images is an art form aimed at marketing, not a reality. * Don't pin your happiness on the success of your holidays. Your happiness should be bigger than just the holidays. Be thankful for the family that you do have, the opportunities you've been given, and the future you can look forward to. Put things into perspective. * By all means, strive to perfect some duties and expectations, but don't expect perfection. Your polar bear cookies might be misshapen, and your chicken overcooked, but it's the thought that count. And thoughts, you've given plenty. * This is where delegation is vital (see below); delegation means shared responsibility for how everything turns out. Seek out help where necessary. This means letting go of some of your control. (It's a good thing.) 8. Acknowledge feelings you have about the season. Not everyone enjoys the holiday season but it's rare for anyone to say it. For most, the truth is that there are the ideals behind the holiday season, and there are the realities, and rarely do the twain meet. If you can acknowledge your worries, concerns and feelings about the season, you are better placed to deal with them in advance and to set limits on what you will––and won't––tolerate. * Don't force yourself to feel happy, buoyant and carefree when you don't. It will only backfire and cause more stress. You're entitled to dislike aspects of the holiday season without stressing over them. Just don't be a Scrooge and ruin other people's fun. * Acknowledging feelings doesn't mean complaining or whining. These activities simply reinforce stressful feelings. Rather than complaining, acknowledge that some things are not enjoyable and set limits on being part of them, without beating yourself up over it. 9. Delegate. Delegation is an antidote to resentment and exhaustion, both of which add to the feelings of stress. Stock up on this antidote and make good use of it. The more you offload, the lighter the stress load and the more involved everyone else becomes. This includes work and home; work out tasks that you can delegate. Then, set about asking the relevant people to do their part. * Let go of your need to control everything. Maybe you're a perfectionist and only trust yourself to get things done the way you want them. In a perfect world, you could control everything."	.

Accentuate your femininity. Start by wearing red lipstick. Studies indicate that men are more drawn to a woman’s lips than any other feature on her face. When you're not in the mood for lipstick, be sure that you at least give your luscious lips some lip balm. Lip gloss works well, too. * Wear red. One recent study found that a group of 96 men were more willing to spend $100 (and presumably more interested in amorous advances) on women who wore red as opposed to different colors. * Do exercises that make your boobs and butt firmer. Work on getting a smaller waist, which you can accentuate by making your butt bigger. If desired, you can also take steps to make your breasts look bigger. 2. Groom yourself well. Staying clean and fresh is a must. Bathe regularly and keep your finger- and toenails clean. Make sure your skin is soft, smooth, and free of blemishes. A lot of people focus on tanning or bleaching their skin. However, the color of their partner's skin is not what attracts most guys, it is the touch; be sure to moisturize, exfoliate, and stay hydrated to keep your skin as soft and supple as possible. * Wash your face twice a day — not more, not less. Once in the morning and once before bed will help cut down on breakouts and help minimize the appearance of large pores. Be sure to moisturize after each time you wash your face. * Shave your legs and armpits regularly. Consider trimming/styling your pubic hair. (This, however, is specific to the man who you are trying to attract.) * Use nice perfume. Nothing drives a guy wild like a good smelling person. Do not overdo it though; wear a light amount so that the guy can smell it when he is close to you. You do not want to wear so much that everyone can smell you when you walk into the room. 3. Wear clothes that flatter your body. We're not all born with perfect bodies; that's the bad news. The good news is that we can change that if we work at it.	.

Have fun. Fatherhood is a big responsibility but it is also a lot of fun. Show your kids that you enjoy being their father. 2. Consider your role as a father. What do you believe should be a father's role in raising children? How did you grow up perceiving fatherhood? The notions you were brought up with will influence your approach to being a father. Some common perceptions of a father's role are: * The father provides, financially and emotionally, for his children, and should care for them too. * The father's role is to discipline along with the mother. Make parenting a partnership, be on the same page about how to discipline your child and be consistent. * A father should give his children affection and warmth - Don't be afraid to tell your child ""I love you, I'm proud of you."" 3. Nothing or nobody should ever come before your child, You chose to be a father and children are forever! They should always always come first no matter what age they are! * A father shows support and love through actions as well as words. 4. Build on tradition. Consider your roles and responsibilites as a father. Ask yourself which are most meaningful and pursue them to the best of your ability. 5. Respect your children's mother. Mutual respect between a child's parents is important whether or not the parents are married to one another. Children will mimic their parents' behavior. How you treat your child's mother will influence the way in which the child will view his or her own role when they become parents. Do not be afraid to stand up for your own views as a parent. They are equally as important and valuable as those of the child's mother who may or may not spend more time with the child. 6. Spend time with and take responsibility for your children. Some fathers miss opportunities to spend time with their kids because they have competing responsibilities or interests that may or may not benefit them. However, once the opportunity has passed, it's gone and you can't get it back. It goes so fast, so make the time the best that it can be. If you don't establish an intimacy with your children when they're young, it'll be difficult to catch up when they're older and still need your help and support. 7. Be a teacher by both word and example. Children will not grow up and miraculously already know right from wrong. Children need to be taught right from wrong and will need to see it demonstrated by their father. Make decisions in front of them and explain to them why you came to that resolution. Talk to them about choices you made in the past and why they did (or didn't) work out. Evaluate all of your own decisions by thinking: ""What would I want my child to do in this situation?"" Teach your children that it is okay to make mistakes. Everyone makes them. You do and they will too. The important thing is to learn from your mistakes and try to avoid making the same mistakes over and over again. 8. Show affection. Some men may be uncomfortable with offering their children affection and communicating their love. Being affectionate with your child shows them that you love them. It also teaches them to show affection to others. 9. Realize that a father's job is never done. Do not assume that once your children turn 21, or they have a college degree, that your work raising them is done."	.
Be_a_Grown_up_and_Mature_Teen.txt	Begin_Revision	0.943	## Steps	875	And , you will feel proud walking up to that podium at graduation as Valedictorian as your class .	## Steps	908	Also , you will feel proud walking up to that podium at graduation as Valedictorian as your class .	<replace><And><1><Also><1>	True	Steps  1. Study adults. See that they are not perfect, but do not get worked up about things. They keep their cool, think before they speak, and remain calm. Try to study a good role model adult that you would like to be like. Watch them and learn to think first in most situations. 2. Work on your Wardrobe. To be grown up and mature, as a teen you do not need to throw out all your clothes and wear a red dress and heels to school every day. But go through your closet and think about what clothes represent your childhood more than the new you. Maybe donate your old Mickey Mouse or Dora the Explorer shirt to a local thrift store and if you can afford it, go out and buy some new, decent clothes. A plain dark wash pair of skinny jeans, and flair jeans, a white blouse, and a few other mature shirts are a must. If you can't afford to or don't live near a shopping mall, look at what your have in your closet and accessorize to make your clothes more grown up. 3. Pick a close knit group of reliable friends. Everyone needs friends. Now that you're older, look around you and pick out a group of friends that you'd like to see yourself in. Maybe the people in that group are maturing like you are. An important part of growing up is picking good friends. So, leave that old group of immature friends who gossip about each other and fight constantly. They have not matured like you yet. 4. Think about what kind of person you want to be. Think about who you want to be when you grow up, and how you want to be treated. You do not have to know what your profession is going to be yet, but it's sometimes good to think about. Think about what kind of family you'd like to have and what college you'd like to go to. You do not have to be sure on any of this, but these are the building blocks on who you are becoming. 5. Get good grades and try your hardest in school. You may not enjoy school one bit, and that's fine. Just always do your best and aim for the top. Getting good grades will get you into a good college after high school, and a good college builds an excellent adult life for you.	If you ever have any troubles in class, talk to the teacher or get an after school tutor. This doesn't mean your stupid. It means you're a smart, mature student that actually wants to have good grades and an excellent life.

Assets include cash and real estate, inventory and equipment, but assets also include less tangible things, such as goodwill and reputation. While all these assets have a value, it is not always easy to put a price on them. General accounting procedures have tried to bring some clarity to this because of the importance of determining value at the sale and purchase of assets or of a business. For example, ""Book Value"" refers to the actual price paid for an asset after you deduct depreciation on an asset."	The Book Value is the value of assets shown on a balance sheet, but it has little or nothing to do with the Asset Market Value. To calculate asset value, add together the total value of a company's tangible and intangible assets and, then, divide that total by the shares outstanding. Obviously, knowing how to calculate asset market value correctly is vital information for buyer and seller.

Begin training your American pit bull as soon as you bring her home unless she's already trained. By nature, the breed is strong-willed and highly intelligent. Without guidance, your pit bull may assume that she is the boss. Whether your dog is a puppy or an adult, start by introducing her to basic commands such as ""no,"" ""down"" and ""off"" using a firm voice. 2. Teach your pit bull how to walk on a leash unless she's already trained. Because the breed is very energetic and strong, your dog may have the urge to run ahead of you or tug at the leash. By pulling back firmly and enforcing her to walk by your side, your pit bull will learn leash manners and your walks will become easy and enjoyable. 3. Housebreak your American pit bull terrier unless already she's house broken. Because the pit bull is intelligent and eager to please her owner, housebreaking is generally easy to accomplish. The best method to use for teaching your dog not to eliminate inside the house is to take her outside frequently and on a regular schedule. Taking your pit bull outdoors first thing in the morning, after meals and playtime, and before bedtime will allow your dog to adjust to a potty break schedule while alerting her that inside is not the appropriate place to eliminate. 4. Set boundaries for your dog. Pit bulls thrive when they are shown what behaviors are expected of them, and what limitations their owners expect. For example, being consistent when it comes to not allowing her on certain furniture items, correcting her verbally if she jumps on visitors, and using a crate for training will give your pet limits to follow. 5. Reinforce positive behaviors by rewarding your pit bull as she begins to learn. Pit bulls thrive on being praised with kind words or rewarded with treats. Doing so will encourage her to repeat good behaviors. 6. Socialize your American pit bull terrier with other animals and people frequently. This will help her understand that other animals and people are not threats to her, and will reduce the tendency for aggressiveness in social situations. 7. Take your American pit bull terrier on a daily walk. Pit bulls have a lot of energy, and need a lot of exercise to channel it in a positive way. Dogs that do not get enough exercise may resort to destructive behavior such as destroying household items. Walking your pit bull at least once a day is a good start to fulfilling her exercise needs. Not only will it give her a physical workout, but the environment around her that she experiences during her walks will stimulate her mind. 8. Indulge in various interactive games with your pit bull, such as fetching a ball or playing with toys. These activities will give your pet added exercise each day while also teaching her which items belong to her. Giving her specific toys to play with will also decrease the likelihood that your pit bull will chew your clothing, furniture and other possessions. 9. Give your dog opportunities to indulge in vigorous, off-leash exercise. Romps in a fenced yard or a dog park will give your pit bull the freedom to work out excessive energy. It will also help her learn to behave in social settings. Monitoring her closely during these activities will ensure her safety. 10. Feed your American pit bull terrier a high-quality dog food that is formulated for active dogs. This type of food will provide the vitamins and minerals necessary for this high-energy breed. 11. Monitor your pet for health conditions that are typical of the breed."	If your dog shows any signs of problems, seek veterinarian attention to keep your pit bull healthy.

Find ways to be grateful. It's not always easy to be grateful, especially in the midst of a bad relationship. Nonetheless, gratefulness can help you cope with the bad relationship, and it can lead to you being happier. * Take time each day to figure out what you are thankful for. Trying writing a few things you are grateful for each day in a journal. You can also use posts on social media for this purpose. Usually, even if the situation is bad, you can find something to be grateful about. * For instance, you may not like how you are being treated in the relationship you are in, but you may be grateful to have financial stability in your life at the moment. Alternatively, maybe you're grateful that the other person in the relationship remains a good parent to your kids. 2. Learn to savor pleasures. Even in an unhappy marriage, you're bound to still enjoy parts of your life. Maybe you love having a decadent dinner every now and then, or you enjoy a luxurious bath. The key is to truly revel in these experiences. When you have them, focus your mind solely on what you are doing, letting every sensation flow over you, flooding your mind. 3. Engage in flow experiences. Flow moments are when you lose yourself to an experience by being completely absorbed in whatever it is you're doing. If you're an artist, a writer, or even a runner, you may already understand this type of experience. It's that moment when the world falls away, and you are just experiencing or enjoying what you're doing. Studies have shown that the more flow moments you have, the happier you are in general. * Choose an activity that challenges you a little bit, but not enough that you need to really think about it. For instance, even swimming in the ocean can create a flow moment, because it requires you to use a skill (swimming), but you don't need to use your whole brain to do it. Try to be fully in the moment, pushing away any thoughts that try to intrude on your activity. 4. Stop fighting the same fights. That is, if you always find yourself arguing about the same things, it may be time to put that topic aside. You either need to decide that you won't discuss it because you can't agree or figure out a compromise that works for both of you. 5. Develop your own interests. If your marriage is not what you want it to be, it may be time to find some fulfillment outside of your marriage and not in the form of an affair. Having your own hobbies and interests will help you stay independent and keep you happy and engaged with the world. In fact, developing your own interests is a good idea even if you have a great marriage. * Consider exploring interests at the library, joining local hobby clubs and cooking classes, or taking a class at a nearby community college. 6. Try volunteering. Many happiness experts point to volunteering as a key to increasing happiness. The reason that's true is because volunteering can give you a sense of purpose in life, which is one of the main keys to happiness. Find a place where you feel needed, and you'll help to increase your happiness, even in a situation where you aren't currently that happy. 7. Realize that more choices may not make you happier. When you're unhappy in a marriage, it could be in part because you've come to know that person's flaws all too well. In light of that, you may think you'd be happier if you had more choices in a mate. In other words, you may think that divorcing your spouse would make you happier, as you could play the field. However, research has shown that having too many choices can overwhelm a person, leading to unhappiness. In addition, you probably realize that finding another person doesn't mean he or she would be perfect, just that that person would have a different set of flaws. 8. Find your social life. Many studies point to relationships being key to happiness. If you're main relationship is unhappy, though, you may not see how you can change your situation.	You can have very real and engaging relationships with friends, as well as other members of your family. In other words, you may need to find your social happiness outside of your spouse.

Plant hibiscus after all danger of frost has passed. 75°F (24°C) is the ideal blooming temperature for hibiscus, although they can withstand warmer and cooler temperatures. There should be no danger of frost after planting your hibiscus. If the temperature falls below 45°F (7°C), the plants may not recover. * Hibiscus cannot survive frost or freezing temperatures. 2. Plant hibiscus in an area that gets full sunlight. You can plant hibiscus outside in spring, summer, or fall in temperate climates. Hibiscus are tropical plants, so they prefer warm temperatures and 8 to 10 hours of direct sunlight each day. The plants will still grow in partial shade, but they will be less healthy and bloom far less frequently in this environment. 3. Make sure the soil drains well before planting hibiscus. Hibiscus need well-draining soil to thrive, and poor-draining soil will cause root rot. To test your soil's drainage, dig a hole that’s about wide and deep. Fill the hole with water. If the water drains in 10 minutes or less, your soil drains well. If it takes an hour or more to drain, the drainage is poor. * To improve drainage, mix in organic matter like well-rotted manure, compost, or peat moss. *	.
Blanch_Cauliflower.txt	Begin_Revision	0.965	### Blanching Cauliflower (Cooking)	2078	Although some people enjoy eating blanched cauliflower plain or lightly flavored with salt , the crunchy texture of blanched cauliflower may make it especially suitable as a salad ingredient .	### Blanching Cauliflower (Cooking)	2162	Though some people enjoy eating blanched cauliflower plain or lightly flavored with salt , the crunchy texture of blanched cauliflower may make it especially suitable as a salad ingredient .	<replace><Although><1><Though><1>	True	Blanching Cauliflower (Cooking)  1. Wash the cauliflower. Rinse the cauliflower under cool, running water to remove traces of dirt and pesticides. Rubbing the vegetable with your fingers while rinsing makes the process much more effective. 2. Cut off the cauliflower florets. Use a sharp knife to remove leaves and thick portions of the main stalk. Cut the florets into pieces about 1 inch (2.5 cm) across, so they blanch at a consistent rate. 3. Start boiling a pot of water. Fill a pot 2/3 full of fresh water, allowing at least 1 gallon of water per pound of cut cauliflower (4 liters per 0.5 kg). Set it on the stove at high heat. While waiting for it to boil, move on to the next step. * Using less water than the recommended amount may result in mushy, overcooked cauliflower, since the water will take longer to return to a boil once the vegetables are added. 4. Prepare an ice bath. Fill a large bowl or a second pot with cold water and ice. This will be used to rapidly cool the cauliflower, and will work best if kept at 60ºF (16ºC) or below. Leave enough space in the bowl to avoid overflowing once the cauliflower is added. * If you do not have ice, try cooling tap water in the freezer while the water on the stovetop boils. 5. Add the cauliflower to the boiling water and cover. Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the cauliflower pieces. Cover the lid to keep the water hot, so it returns to a boil as quickly as possible. * If you have a wire basket that fits into the pot, this can make the cauliflower easier to remove. If the cauliflower is loose in the water, locate a slotted spoon so you can remove the cauliflower once boiled. 6. Decide whether to add salt. Optionally, you may add salt to the water at this stage, using 4 teaspoons per gallon of water (5 mL per liter). This may enhance the flavor, but is not recommended if you plan to freeze the cauliflower as salt can break down the cell walls and make the vegetables soft and less flavorful. 7. Boil the cauliflower for three minutes. As soon as the water has returned to a boil, set a timer for three minutes, or note the time on a clock. Once three minutes have elapsed, remove the cauliflower with a slotted spoon. * The cauliflower should emerge partially cooked, but still firm. If it has become soft or mushy, it may not retain its flavor or nutrients for long. * Alternatively, you may drain the cauliflower over a colander or sieve to remove it from the water. However, this prevents you from using the water for an additional purpose, such as blanching the next batch or cooking pasta. 8. Immediately submerge the cauliflower in the ice bath. Place the hot cauliflower florets into the ice bath. This rapid cooling seals in the flavor and nutrients of the vegetable, as well as the color if you are preparing colored cauliflower. 9. Dry the cauliflower once cooled. Once the cauliflower is cold to the touch, remove it from the ice bath and pat dry with a paper towel. Excess water on the surface may break down the cauliflower once it freezes into ice crystals, making this step especially important if you plan to store the cauliflower long term. 10. Freeze any cauliflower you do not use immediately. Once blanched, the cauliflower can typically maintain its high quality for at least 12 months in the freezer. Freeze the pieces on a flat tray first so they do not stick together, then keep them in airtight containers in the freezer. * There is no need to leave additional space in the containers, as cauliflower does not expand in the freezer. 11. Serve the blanched cauliflower or finish cooking it later.	If you wish to make the cauliflower softer, boil it for a few minutes longer, or add it to a recipe during cooking.

Calculate your annualized return. Now that you know the equation and understand what it is showing you, it is simply a matter of plugging in your numbers. * For example, suppose that over a seven-year period, your portfolio grew in value from $1,000 to $2,500. * First, calculate your overall return: (2,500-1,000)/1000 = 1.50 (a return of 150%). * Next, calculate your annualized return: (1 + 1.50)-1 = 0.1300=13.00% annual return. That's all there is to it! * Use the ordinary mathematical order of operations: do the operations inside the parentheses first, then apply the exponent, then do the subtraction. 2. Calculate semi-annual returns. Now, let's say that you want to find semiannual returns (returns occurring twice a year, every six months) over the course of this seven-year period. The formula stays the same; you need only to adjust the number of periods that you are measuring. Your final result will be a semiannual return. * In this case, you will have 14 semiannual periods, two per year over the course of seven years. * First calculate your overall return: (2,500-1,000)/1000 = 1.50 (a return of 150%). * Next calculate your annualized return: (1 + 1.50)-1 = 6.76%. * You can convert this into an annual return by simply multiplying by two. 3. Calculate an annualized equivalent.	Once again, the formula stays the same.

At first glance, you may think that it is very hard to use, however, it is quite simple to use and I will show you how to simply mix in between song to song like a pro.  1. Open the ""djay2"" application that you just installed 2. You will now see a few messages telling you to turn on your notifications for this application, go ahead and choose which ever option you would like. Once you are through with that, you will be presented with the main screen which will have two decks and different sliders/buttons across the screen. 3. Now we are going to add a song to a deck. Navigate your way to the upper left-hand corner of the turntable section. You will see a music note icon that has a little plus sign, tap that.  1. Here you will be able to choose any song that you desire. Once you have found the song that you want to use simply tap the song.  1. To add another song on the opposing deck, simply repeat steps 4-5. In addition, you may have noticed as soon as you add a song it begins to play. For right now, just hit the pause button which is located on the bottom right or left (depending on which deck you are on) to pause the song. 2. Mixing."	"A unique feature about this application is that it provides an ""AUTOMIX"" option. Meaning, all you have to do is load up your songs on each deck and then just hit play, the application will do the rest for you. In other words, as the song reaches to an end, it will automatically transition over to the next song. This method of mixing is preferably for beginners, all you have to do is keep loading up songs on the empty decks (which is just repeating steps 3 through 5) However, if you have experience in this field and know how to use the application, then you may simply mix by sliding the crossfader button back in forth."
Be_an_Effective_Parent_to_an_Adolescent_Girl.txt	Begin_Revision	0.615	## Steps	1289	And it shows her respect .	## Steps	1328	Also , it shows her respect .	<insert><Also><1>|||<replace><And><1><,><2>	True	Steps  1. Love your daughter. (OK, you naturally do!) But remember to keep telling and showing her that she is loved. It's surprisingly easy to overlook, and can turn your daughter's whole outlook around. 2. Listen to your daughter. Although it's natural to want to constantly dispense advice, encouragement, commentary, and question her, you're more likely to get insights into her by really paying attention to what she is saying (or not saying) and how she says it. She'll also be more likely to listen to you if she feels she's being heard. 3. Make it easier for your daughter to listen: * Sometimes approaching her with a written letter given in person is a persuasive method of getting her to 'listen' to what you have to say. She can take the letter to her own space and read it in her own time. Give her a day or two to digest it and to come up with her response. * When you're talking (or writing), address her directly. Don't bring in information about other people or unrelated issues. Listen to what she has to say and create an open environment without judging her. * Don't create comparisons, such as with a sibling. This will make her feel as if she is a lesser person than someone else. That's not fair. * Admit when you're wrong--even if she wasn't right, either. A teenager can deal with a parent admitting he or she is imperfect. This gives her the space to reflect on her own contributions and lets her know that you are serious in working things through.	.

Don't be mean, rude, or critical of people, but don't be a doormat either. If you don't like something about someone, try to say it in the cutest, most polite way possible. Chances are that person won't get offended and think about their actions... but if they don't, then they weren't really that much worthy, were they? 2. Laugh a lot, be happy, be sweet and smile. Cute is all about being positive and friendly; make sure your personality reflects this. always try to have a better outlook of things, rather than let negativeness pull you down. that will help you overcome problems and in the long run you'll be able to help others as well. 3. Being innocent is an asset to be cute. but in honest truth you cannot revert to be childishly innocent after a certain age. Even so, you can revive some of that spark in various ways like staying away from sensationalist publications and shows, not watching adult videos or magazines, things like that. 4. Be careful about what you say. Sweet innocent girls don't swear like sailors. Don't pick on people; never laugh at someone's misfortune or when someone gets hurt. Instead of laughing at them, stand up for them. 5. Don't be too loud. If you want to look sweet, don't bawl and shout at people. Talk to them, and be nice and gentle, and this will help you be cute no matter what age you are. 6. Don't get in fights or pick on people. For one thing, it shouldn't be done, second, innocent girls must avoid this. 7. Keep your jewelry simple. Charm bracelets, pearls, and pendants are great. Do not wear something crazy and flashy.	Wear maximum 2 necklaces and max. 3 bracelets on each hand. Your choice, just don't overdo it.

Get a 2-piece mold frame. To successfully cast metal, you’ll first need to acquire a mold frame (also known as a mold flask) made of wood, iron, or a similarly solid material. Make sure the frame comes in 2 parts and is large enough to hold the object you want to cast. * Look for mold frames online or from specialty metal supply stores. * As long as it is sturdy, the specific material used to make your mold frame does not matter. 2. Place the object you want to cast in 1 of the mold frame pieces. Place 1 of your mold frame pieces on a flat working surface. Then, put your casting object in the center of the frame, making sure its flattest side sits face down on the table. * If you’re casting an object that comes in 2 pieces, place the bulkiest piece in the frame right now. * If you want to create an original metal object, you’ll first need to construct a prototype version out of wood or a similar material. Then, you can place your prototype in the mold frame. * Some popular casting items include coins, trophies, figurines, gears, and pipes. 3. Cover the top of your object with parting dust. Before pouring any molding material into your frame, grab a bag of parting dust and sprinkle it over the object you want to cast. The parting dust will prevent the molding material from sticking to your object, creating a more refined mold. * Look for parting dust online or at metal casting supply stores. 4. Fill the cast with molding sand. Grab a container of molding sand, sprinkle the material with water, and toss the sand with wooden blocks until it turns into a semi-dry paste. Then, pour the material into a riddle and sift it into the mold frame. Once you’ve covered the casting object, tamp the sand with your fingers to better preserve the pattern.	.

Create an account. Go on the website and make your account. You can find the link by looking at the top. Click on the ""Don't have an account? Sign up"" link, to be exact! 2. Activate it by responding to the email. Now, we get started! Find a good 50x50 icon by searching dA or an image hosting service. If you have the means, which you should if you don't have a monstrously old computer without paint, you can make your own. You can crop an image, original or not, and save it as a gif. preferably (especially if it's animated), or as a png. if it contains a lot of transparencies. 3. Customize your page. When you log in, go to your settings which can be found in the tool bar. While there, you can also change your ""signature"", which will show up whenever you make a comment on someone else's work. Look around at popular pieces of art and look at the sayings under people's comments to get some ideas, though you should just do something original. Signatures can get old and show that you would just rather sway with the crowd than be creative. Begin a journal also. If you have something interesting to say, say it. Many people like to know ""the-day-in-the-life-of"" and it certainly helps gain views when you have some fans. 4. Upload your art, whether its photography, digital art, painting, or whatever you would like to make. But, here comes the safety part! Do Not, I Repeat, Do Not Steal Someone Else's Work! It may seem tempting but you can get banned from certain areas (i.e. forums or the chat rooms) or possibly the entire website, unable to reclaim the screen name of your banned account. Art theft is also a felony and you can have charges pressed upon you. 5. Pick your topic wisely. This is important, especially if you are trying to appeal to specific types of art critics. Creating digital art of Naruto, or Bleach, and of popular books like Harry Potter are good ways to gain page views though can be looked down upon by more talented members if your artistic ability doesn't show promise for original art work. Artistic topics can be overdone and the previous subjects HAVE been overdone. If you have a camera, take lots of photos, but make sure the photography can be considered artistic and are within the guidelines of the site. This is not Myspace and do not ""cam whore"" for anything other than personal profile use. 6. Practice. Your first works will pale in comparison to works produced after practice, and they will also gain a slight following which will continue to grow as your skill improves. Practice makes perfect. 7. Publicize. When you feel ready, go out in the forums or chat rooms to help people get to know you and your art. Please do not be rude in the process. Simply talking nicely, or even just entering a chat room is enough to have people view your page. ""Advertising"" yourself can get you banned or ignored. 8. Try to post a good amount per week/day. Doing this will help your popularity on deviantART showing your art to those who have there deviantART homepage on ""newest"". This may add a new ""fan"" of your work or better said, a new friend."	.
Be_Supportive_of_Divorcing_Parents_As_an_Adult.txt	Begin_Revision	0.847	## Steps	2518	Because you are very close to the situation and trusted by both it will be very easy to get sucked in too deep .	### Staying sane	2604	As you are very close to the situation and trusted by both , it will be very easy to get sucked in too deep .	<replace><Because><1><As><1>|||<insert><,><13>	True	Steps  1. Talk to your parents. Ask questions if you need to better understand. * If one parent has shared this news you should make sure the other parent is aware of the decision before you say anything. * It is not your place to inform the other parent. * You may have to be firm but they should be the one who informs the other parent of their wish to divorce. Don't blame them for not wanting to have the discussion but do not agree to have it for them. * Realize the decision to tell the children was very difficult and probably a major point in the process. * Be sensitive. You probably have not lived with them for some time and are not aware of all the issues that have developed 2. Find out who else is aware of the pending divorce. If your siblings or step-siblings do not know, wait until your parents have had time to discuss it with each of them. * Make sure your parents inform your other siblings as soon as possible. You don't want them finding out the wrong way from the wrong person. You will need to work on this as a family and that means the family being informed. 3. Talk to your parents, siblings and spouse and try to determine the best time to inform your children of their grandparents' divorce. * Consider how far you live from your parents, siblings and other relatives. If they are at risk from learning this information from another relative or family friend you should make time to have a family meeting and share the news. * Explain to your children that you will be helping your parents as much as possible and your attention may be divided. * Explain that it doesn't change who their grandparents are, they will still be grandmother and grandfather. Encourage them to still speak and interact with them individually. * Consider the maturity of the child and their closeness to their grandparents. 4. Discuss the situation with your siblings * Make sure you have a solid line of communication with them. * Agree to discuss things openly and honestly. * Agree to not take sides but to share information and help each other and your parents get through this tough time. 5. Discuss the situation with your step-siblings if your parent has remarried. It will be natural for everyone to take the side and look out for the best interest of the birth parent. At least try to be objective and keep the lines of communication open with your step-siblings. Try to be supportive and let them know you are available should they need anything. 6. Let your parents know that you will be as supportive as you can but you don't want to feel pressured to take sides. * Ask them to refrain from disparaging comments about your other parent. * Because you are older and less impressionable by your parents this may not be as big of an issue. * Discuss this approach with your siblings. 7. Remember that previous divorces, especially where there were custody battles, may have made your parents bitter and offensive about the divorce process. * Keep calm and don't encourage aggressive legal behavior. Ask your siblings to do the same. * The divorce process may actually be much easier with the children grown. 8. Ask how you can help. * You may be needed to help sort and move property. * You may be needed for moral support * You and your siblings may need to help a parent arrange for lawn care, help with laundry, etc. if that was something your other parent maintained. 9. Ask if you and/or your siblings need to attend meetings with attorneys or financial planners. 10. Make sure your parents revise their wills, medical powers of attorney, etc. 11. Discuss with your parents any medical wishes or other long term care details that would have previously been the decision of the spouse. Your parents may have avoided that conversation with you since you were the child and assumed the spouse would take care of those arrangements. * Find out where your parents want to be buried * Ask if there are family burial plots that have been purchased. If the divorce will exclude a parent from the plot ask the parent where he/she would like to be buried. * If either parent has medical problems you should try to attend a doctor's appointment with that parent. Get an understanding of the condition, the medications and make sure the doctor's office changes the next of kin listed on the file. 12. Discuss holiday plans, events for the grandchildren and other family gatherings with your siblings. Make sure you spend time with each parent and do your best not to exclude the other parent from holiday plans or other events. * Perhaps move family gatherings to your home or siblings house instead of your parents' home. If you do visit a parent who doesn't cook, offer to cook something there or make it potluck. * Consider having your mother over for lunch on a holiday and your father over for dinner. 13. Know your limits.	.

Have an interesting or unique location: Where you live can make a difference. Where you live has a lot to do with whether or not you are ‘reality show’ worthy. Right now Alaskan reality shows are very common, and because of this people who live there have been made targets for reality TV stardom so you may have more chance if you live in Alaska or some where similar. Not everyone can choose where they live, but if you can choose where to live, try to find a place that is common for reality shows. This changes often- as different things become popular. Unique geographical locations (Hawaii, Alaska, the ‘wilderness’) are all very common places for reality show settings. Also bigger cities like New York and Los Angeles are well known for their ‘filming scene’. Benefit Street was popular in the UK and New Zealand. You don't have to have a 'rich' lifestyle to be famous in the reality TV world. 2. Have Your Own Story: Everyone has a tale to tell! Have a background story. What makes your life interesting? Fur buyers in a very remote part of Alaska who live in an Eskimo village and live a subsistence lifestyle (hunting, fishing, and gathering a lot of their food) are IDEAL reality TV stars so if your life is anything like that, great, you have more chance of being a reality TV star than a school girl from Norwich, unless she drives dog sleds...Live a life that very few people live, and, if it’s a life many people find interesting, television channels may believe it’s worthy of it’s own show. Anything can be a good story. Get creative and think of something that makes your life truly unique. You could take a road trip across America with your best friends or live as a hermit (never leaving your apartment) in America’s most populated cities. There are literally endless possibilities for a reality show- all you need to do is think of one that’s truly going to ‘wow’ a viewing audience and make them want to tune in each week for every episode. 3. Make Yourself Accessible: It's all about who you know. Be accessible to people who want to hear your story. Write blogs, make YouTube videos, run your own website. Use social media and have connections to people. Basically, use the Internet to market yourself. By putting your story out there on the web, you are welcoming anyone to contact you. Make the effort to have your contact information accessible. Have an email readily and easily found on all of your websites. If you have a business web site, always have a phone number associated with them. This made you an easy target for people scouting for reality shows- because you can be easily contacted and any program makers will have a bit of a background regarding what you do. 4. Contact The Appropriate Stations: Pitching your own show to the appropriate station could work wonders. Many television stations welcome ideas to be pitched to them, and will listen to different thoughts regarding a reality show. You may not always get a reply, but if you have a true ‘gem’ they will certainly make an effort to get in contact with you.	.

Shower daily. Shower as soon as it is convenient if you have been exercising. Yes, there are some people who don't do this and are under the incorrect assumption that they do not smell. What happens is your nose gets fatigued thereby not being able to smell your bad odor. You'll notice this effect with car air fresheners as well. After a while, you won't smell it anymore while other people will tell you it's still very strong. 2. Wear deodorant. It doesn't matter if you think you don't smell. It doesn't matter if you think you barely sweat. Just buy a stick of deodorant (or some body spray) and use it. The issue mentioned in 1 applies here too. You may stink of sour or musky sweat and not realize it. It's better to be safe than sorry... It hardly takes any time to apply and it's not expensive. At worst, you go from smelling like nothing to smelling lightly of deodorant. At best, you go from driving people away with your stink to smelling not that bad. If your feet smell, consider using foot powder... it'll make your feet smell better and keep your feet dry and cool. 3. Do not over-apply perfume or cologne. Many people are allergic to perfumes and you will, unknowingly, cause a reaction. Plus, there is no reason for people to ""smell you coming"" or smell you once you've left the room. Dab a little on your wrists or neck for a subtle smell if you must. 4. Back and shoulder hair. If you're naturally hairy, that's fine. Many people (even women) will say it's weird for a man to shave his chest."	If you are uncomfortable with a hairy body, have someone help Nair, shave, or wax it off. Since the back does not harbor the same humid conditions that result in bacteria growth as in the underarms or crotch, back hair does not cause or increase body odor and removing it will not change whether you have body odor or not.

Get a dual rate if you want to deal with only one provider. Some providers will offer a dual rate, where the rate for gas and electricity are bundled together. The dual rate can then be fixed or variable, depending on the provider. This is a good option if you do not want to have to pay two different providers for each service. * Most major energy companies will offer a dual rate to make paying for energy more convenient for customers. 2. Opt for a fixed rate if you prefer a stable, affordable price. A fixed rate means the price for gas and electricity will stay the same for the duration of your contract with the energy company. If you use more energy, your cost of energy will go up. The rate per kilowatt, however, will stay the same. * You will need to sign a contract with the energy company to get a fixed rate, but this may be a good option if you do not want to have to worry about the price of gas and electricity going up. 3. Go for a variable rate if you do not want to sign a contract. Variable or standard rates will fluctuate based on the cost of energy in the marketplace. This means you may pay less for energy one month and more another month. Variable rates allow you to switch from provider to provider as you are not tied to a contract.	.

It will tell you exactly what you need to do to remove the shade. Alternatively, try searching the make and model online for advice. 2. Unscrew the base of the old light from the ceiling by hand. Locate the screws holding the old fixture in place. They will be around the center part of the fixture, underneath the lightbulbs. Light fixtures typically have 2 of them. Twist them counterclockwise by hand and be prepared for the old base to fall off once they are loosened. * Many bases are held in place by nuts on the screws. You twist the nuts counterclockwise by hand like you would with a bare screw. The base will slide off the screws as soon as the nuts are gone. * Have a friend ready to assist you with the base so it doesn’t fall. If you’re working alone, try using painter’s tape to loosely secure the base to the ceiling.	.

Determine who will receive your property. At death, your property will be transferred to beneficiaries. You should identify who you want to receive your property. Also choose someone to inherit in case the original beneficiary dies before you. * You can also give the trustee instructions for how to distribute property. For example, if you are leaving assets to minors, you might not want the trustee to transfer the property until they reach a certain age, such as 21. 2. Include a durable power of attorney. You can appoint someone to manage your affairs should you become incapacitated. Include a power of attorney in your trust. The agent you appoint can make medical decisions for you and handle your finances. * The agent you appoint should be someone you trust, such as a child or spouse. * Talk to your agent ahead of time to decide what kinds of treatment you want to receive once you are incapacitated. A trusted agent should honor your wishes. * Also remember to name one or more successor agents in case your first pick cannot serve in the role. 3. Appoint a trustee. The trustee will manage the property owned by the trust. As long as you are living, you will be the trustee. However, you’ll need to appoint someone to succeed you as trustee after you die. This person will be responsible for transferring assets to your beneficiaries. * The trustee might also manage assets on behalf of minor children or disabled adults. In that situation, you might want to name someone with experience managing trust assets, such as a lawyer or asset management company. * You might decide to make the successor trustee the primary beneficiary. For example, if you leave everything to your only child, then you could name them as the successor trustee. 4. Find sample trusts. You can draft a revocable trust by finding samples online and using them as models for your own. For example, Nolo has a revocable living trust document. You can also find sample trust documents in books at your local library. * In addition, you might want to use software or online programs that can help you. These programs ask you sample questions and create a trust document based on your answers. 5. Consult with a trusts and estates attorney. You can certainly draft a simple revocable trust on your own. However, you should definitely consult with an experienced trusts and estates attorney. They can review your document and identify anything that is missing. * Find a trusts and estates attorney by contacting your local or state bar association. Ask for a referral. * Call up the attorney and schedule a meeting. Tell them you have a draft trust document you want them to review. Ask how much they will charge to review the document. 6. Execute the trust. You’ll need to sign your trust in front of a notary public. Accordingly, you should include a notary block at the bottom of your document. Search online for an appropriate block. * You can find a notary at your county courthouse, town office, or at most large banks. Make sure to take sufficient personal identification with you, such as a valid driver’s license or passport. * You should also sign the trust in front of a witness, who cannot be a beneficiary. Check with a lawyer about your state’s precise legal requirements. 7. Re-title assets. The trust must hold assets included in the trust. This means you will hold the assets in your position as trustee. For example, you might transfer real estate to “Michael Jones, trustee of the Michael Jones Revocable Living Trust dated April 11, 2017.” * Some assets don’t have a title.	.

Check the date. The newest $100 bills are “Series 2009” bills, and they have many different security features. Older bills are being phased out of circulation to prevent counterfeiters from fooling people. Nevertheless, older bills are still legal tender, so if you get one you shouldn’t automatically assume it is fake. Check the date on the bill. * The average $100 bill stay in circulation for seven years. Accordingly, most of the older bills should be out of circulation by now. Nevertheless, you might have one or more stored at home that you want to check. 2. Feel the bill. U.S. currency has a distinctive feel. The bills are printed on cotton and linen, not paper. Also, bills should have slightly raised ink, which is a feature of the printing process. If you handle currency as part of your job, you should quickly develop familiarity with the feel of authentic money. * Using feel is not a fool-proof method, however. The most successful counterfeiters will bleach real money and then use the bill. *	.

Observe how your partner interacts with his or her child. It's important you're comfortable with how your partner parents. If you're not okay with your partner's parenting style for any reason, this is not a good sign the relationship is sustainable. * Remember, when you're dating a single parent you're becoming part of a familial unit. You have to make sure you're comfortable with the family culture at hand. Carefully observe how your partner interacts with his or her child and make sure you're comfortable with how they function as a family. * Being uncomfortable does not necessarily mean you feel your partner is a bad parent.	You could simply just feel out of place within your partner's family. Maybe your partner values different things than you do. He or she could be raising his or her child with a strong religious background and you're agnostic. Your partner could put a lot of emphasis on success and focus while you see yourself as more laid back.

Check the serving size. Accurately counting macros means using the serving size to determine the macro content of whatever you ate. Look for the serving size just below the large “nutrition facts” header on the nutrition label. * Serving sizes vary according to different types of food. Some will be listed in ounces, others in fluid ounces, some in grams, some in units of food (i.e., “10 crackers”) and so on. * Be sure to check the servings per container, too. If a can of beets says that one serving has 80 grams of carbs and there are three servings per container, the whole can of beets contains 240 grams of carbs. 2. Tally the fat. Many nutrition labels have a total for all fat, then separate totals for saturated fat and unsaturated fat. There is no need to tally the different sorts of fat differently. Just make a note of the total fat, typically denoted in grams, in a small notebook. Alternately, add the totals in a fitness tracking app of your choice. 3. Take note of the carbs. Just like the fat total, the carbohydrate totals are usually denoted in grams. Make a note of the total carbs in your macronutrient notebook or fitness tracking app. * Sugar is often listed as a subcategory just below the carb count. However, you don’t need to create a separate category for sugar, since the total amount of sugar in a given food is included in the total carb count. 4. Note the protein. Protein is the third and final element in the macro-counting triumvirate. Protein, like the carbohydrate and fat totals, is expressed in grams. Write the protein count of the food you’re eating in a notebook or in your fitness tracking app alongside the other two. 5. Know what you don’t need to count. Lots of information on the nutrition label is irrelevant from a macro-counting perspective. For instance, don’t bother counting calories.	.

Few people are destined for the path they wish to live. In ballet, if you are going for a career, having the right body is almost what is the most important thing. Facility and musicality, as well as drive and a willingness to learn are just as important, but without the right body a career in ballet dancing is impossible. * Sometimes a dancer can fit in very well in the corps de ballet, but will never become a soloist or principal dancer. This does not mean that a career in ballet dancing is not right for them. Remember, without the corps de ballet there would be no ballet. * Male and female dancers are equally important in the ballet. * If you know you have sprained an ankle or teared a muscle, tell the teacher. If you let an injury go untreated for a long time, it will take longer to heal and can sometimes end your career, and for a student in school, even before it has started. * Acting classes are great for improving expression in ballet. Although in some ballet schools, or even regular school, drama is a part of the curriculum. But remember ballet technique classes must come first! * As stated before, be CARING. Actually CARE about others - be it friends, relatives, younger and older dancers... Also try to UNDERSTAND. For example, if someone is dancing terribly because they are nervous, remember when you were nervous and the impact it made on your dancing.	.

Convert_a_Percentage_to_a_Fraction.txt	Begin_Revision	0.694	### Writing a Simplified Fraction	343	But , 6 and 10 share a common factor of 2 , which means it can be reduced further to 3 / 5 .	### Writing a Simplified Fraction	405	However , 6 and 10 share a common factor of 2 , which means it can actually be reduced even further , to 3 / 5 .	<replace><But><1><However><1>|||<insert><actually><17>|||<insert><even><19>|||<insert><,><20>	True	Writing a Simplified Fraction  1. Replace the % in your number with “/100.” The % symbol is really just a shorthand way of writing a fraction in which the bottom number is always 100. So, if you have 32%, you can write it as 32/100 and it will mean the same thing. Once it is written as a fraction, you may be able to simplify it into a more manageable number. 2. Use the common factor approach. To determine the greatest common factor, you need to figure out the largest number that you can divide into both your numerator and your denominator, exactly. For example, if you begin with 32/100, the greatest common denominator is 4 because there are no numbers larger than 4 that can go into both 32 and 100 with no parts left over. 32 divided by 4 equals 8 and 100 divided by 4 equals 25. That means in this example, your simplified fraction for 32% is 8/25. 3. Check your reduced fraction to make sure you got the common factor right. If you didn’t, then you will be able to reduce your numbers even further. If you begin with 60% and convert that to a fraction, it will look like 60/100. You might think that the largest common factor for this is 10, which will leave you with 6/10.	.

Leather cleaners contain mild surfactants that scrub away dirt and stains, and oils that help soften the leather and keep it healthy. You can typically find leather cleaners at superstores, along with any place that specializes in leather. * A bottle of leather cleaning solution only costs a few dollars and is likely to last for years. 2. Apply the leather cleaner to the jacket. Squirt a dime-sized glob of leather cleaning solution onto the dirty part of the jacket. You won’t need to use much—leather cleaners are formulated to get the job done with minimal manual effort. You may have to apply the cleaner several times if the jacket is particularly dingy. * Leather cleaning solutions typically come in creams, but may also take the form of gels, sprays and even solid bar soaps.	.

Prepare the area. There are a few things you should do to make sure your cleaning area is ready for you to begin the process of cleaning your diamonds. Start by adding a stopper to your sink to ensure that your diamonds do not fall through and end up going down the sink drain. This would be a nightmare for you to have to take apart the pipes to retrieve your diamonds. * Additionally, you should fill the stopped up sink with hot water. This will be the base for your cleaning solution. 2. Ready the cleaning solution. Begin by microwaving some standard window cleaner for approximately 30 seconds in the microwave oven. When you finish with that, pour half a cup of the cleaner into the warm water in the sink. Mix the cleaner into the water and this will create your cleaning solution. * Be careful not to microwave the cleaner for more than 30 seconds as this could cause the plastic bottle to melt. 3. Clean the diamond. Dip the diamonds into the cleaning solution in the sink and let the jewelry remain there for a minute or so. Then, you should take a clean toothbrush and dip it in the warm cleaning solution as well. Use the toothbrush, with bristles wet from the cleaner, to gently scrub and clean the diamonds. * Remove the diamonds from the window cleaning solution, and scrub them carefully with the toothbrush. * Be careful not to drop the diamonds or scratch too hard.	.

Use a syringe to draw up some of the “lava.” Use a bulb syringe or a regular small syringe to suck up as much liquid as possible. Do this near the coconut to minimize spills and drips from transporting the lava solution to the coconut. Wearing gloves during this step can help minimize stains on your hands and fingers. 2. Squirt the lava solution into the top of the coconut volcano. Remember the three little holes that you used to drain the water? Now you can stick the syringe in one of those same holes and squirt in your lava solution. This will bring the lava in contact with the baking soda and start the reaction! 3. Watch the eruption. Pull the syringe away quickly and step back to watch the volcano. The vinegar solution and baking soda should start to react, sending bubbles and liquid out of the holes at the top of your coconut volcano. The kids love this part, and it’s a great time to explain the science involved. 4. Replace the baking soda and do it again. The best thing about the coconut volcano is that it is easy to replicate. Just lift the coconut up and put more baking soda underneath. Then, get some more of your lava solution and make it erupt again. * When you are finished making your volcano erupt, you can save it to use as a normal toy volcano. 5. Let your kids participate. Watching the volcano erupt is great, but actually helping create and carry out the experiment will make your kids love it that much more. Using the syringe to suck up the lava and squirt it into the volcano will give them a chance to work on their fine motor skills.	.

Use lubricant. Since the vaginal walls are thinning as your hormones progressively change, you also may experience vaginal dryness because the vagina produces less moisture. Lubricants with a water base help when you start to feel discomfort. * You may also find that vaginal moisturizers, which are inserted internally, can help reduce changes in your pH, preventing bacterial infections. 3.

Good grades always make a parent proud and happy. If you get good grades, they'll most likely be happier overall and more willing to invest in an iPhone for you. If you get a bad grade, tell your parents that you will try harder and bring it up (have a good grade to show them after). 4. If they're not letting you pay for half, offer to pay for the whole thing. Understand that it will be a big investment, but worth it if you intend on taking proper care and using it often. 5. Be patient. As the old saying goes, good things come to those who wait. If you are not patient, it will take even more time and effort to get your iPhone. 6. Be responsible. Take good care of the belongings you have now to show that you can take care of an iPhone! Don't lose anything while trying to get your iphone, because that does not show your parents that you are responsible to have such an expensive device 7. Respect your parents' decision. If they say no, there is probably a reason why. Maybe you can't afford it, or maybe they don't think you are responsible enough. If they say yes, be happy! Thank them and try your best to keep up the good behavior even after receiving your new iPhone! 8. Act like an adult. If one (or both) of your parents have an iPhone, show them that you are responsible just like them and do things that they would normally do, like cook or clean the house. It may sound boring, but this will get you the iPhone you are looking for. 9. Don't nag. Parents hate it when you ask them over and over for things. Sure it might work a few times, but probably not for something like an iPhone. Keep calm and wait a while, maybe remind them once or twice, but not too often. 10. Write an article. To show you are responsible write an informative letter stating the pros and cons of an iPhone. Mention your grades, the monthly bill, and why you think you deserve it. 11. Do chores. Offer to help with chores around the house, like taking out the trash, taking care of your pets, washing the dishes, etc. 12. Help pay off the bills. Save up some extra money to help pay for the phone as well as the monthly bill - iPhones are expensive and your parents might not be up for the idea of spending $20-$30 extra a month for the data. 13.	They will probably not be happy if they find out you were just putting on a good act to get the iPhone.

Before cleaning, remember the two biggest enemies of hardwood flooring. The first is scratches that leave unsightly jagged lines across the wood grain. The second is water, which can cause your floors to warp and loosen over time. Avoid any cleaning methods that could introduce such elements to your floors. 2. Begin by sweeping with a soft broom to remove large dirt particles. Once a week, vacuum with a soft brush attachment to pick up smaller particles that the broom might have left behind. Make sure your vacuum is set to the proper height to suction much of the grime. 3. Once the majority of the dirt is removed, use a very lightly dampened mop to thoroughly clean the floor.	The mop shouldn’t leave any moisture on the surface, and it should be washed often during the cleaning to avoid scratching the surface of the hardwood.

Be alert. Today is the day for pranks of all kinds, whether they come from friends and family or they're online, TV or radio prank. There will definitely be some merriment and foolishness about, so put your sense of humor into gear and be prepared! 2. Know how long it's okay to joke around for. This depends on where you live; in some places, the pranks are only permissible till noon, while in others, all day is fair game. Here are a few examples: * Pranks and jokes can only go until noon in: Canada, New Zealand, the UK, Australia, Cyprus, and South Africa. * Pranks and jokes can happen all day in: France, Italy, South Korea, Japan, Russia, The Netherlands, Germany, Brazil, Ireland, and the U.S. and so on. * If you prank or joke for April Fool's Day beyond the appropriate time, you are considered the fool, with this chant a possible retort: ""April Fool's Day's past and gone, You're the fool for making one."" 3. Play pranks. There are numerous different types of pranks that you can play on this day. First, some basics, and then the following sections will outline suggestions for pranks to try out: * The type of prank depends on your resources and what's tolerable for the victim. For example, a prank that totally messes up a friend's clothing might be fine because you're friends but it wouldn't be fine for the school principal or boss to have their clothes messed up by your prank. Use your common sense and definitely don't blow the budget. * The prank doesn't have to be elaborate. It can simply be a prank phone call to an understanding mate, or an elaborate switch of their caffeine level of coffee. * Planning is everything. You need to know the prank victim's patterns and figure out the best way to disrupt them. * The best pranks happen when the victim is caught off guard. Early morning is the best time to play them, because many people do do not realize that it is April 1st yet. * The classic ending to a prank is someone popping out to say ""April fools!"" But the more creative you get, the more fun it will be. Put signs up in places that they will eventually see (for example, hide the victim's keys and place a post on their steering wheel). * Laugh your head off because you got them; just be sure it's clear that you're laughing at the effect of the prank, rather than at them personally. Never use condescending or nasty language to imply that they are a real fool. * For more details on perfecting a prank, see How to play a prank. 4. Try some pranks with your friend's gear. Watch their surprise (or horror) as you mess around with their beloved belongings: * Ask to borrow their iPod, then snip off the cord. Of course, you'll be able to magically restore it. * Borrow their favorite hardcover and make it appear that you're ripping the cover. * Stick their favorite pen or pencil to the ceiling. * Sew your beloved's underpants together with quick, easily undone stitches and gently arrange them back in the drawer. When he or she goes to take them out, they'll all come out at once. This could be done with any other clothes, such as socks or t-shirts or you can do it with things they'd normally use, like towels or face washers. 5. Freak people out with crazy pranks. If you're known for being a little nuts, make the most of it on this riotously fund day. * Make edible glass and eat it or crash through it. * Get your arm caught in a door––ouch! Be sure to include accompanying noises of sufficient agony. A car door can be effective if you plan it properly. * Cause everyone to start sneezing. 6. Try some food pranks. There are lots of possibilities, from ghastly food that you're happily tucking into, to food that disappears, pops or makes strange movements when someone else eats it, to food that won't be eaten because the prankster can see straight away that it's mutated or weird food. There are limitless possibilities––here are just a few: * Eat fake dirt and gross out your friends. * Suspend a needed item inside jello. If you're at home, choose something needed on the breakfast table. If you're at work, put the communally used stapler into the jello. * Clog up the salt shaker so that no salt comes out when your victim tries to use it. Another salt trick is to swap the sugar and salt around. *"	.

Turn your computer around or go on the other side of the room, then play the music and do the dance as well as you can without watching. It’s okay if you don’t remember everything! Go back and watch the video afterwards to see what you can work on, then keep trying until you get it all. * Have fun with it! Whether the dance is powerful, joyful, sassy or sexy, get into the attitude and let it show in your face and movements. Dances are much more fun to watch and perform if you’re focused on having a great time. 3. Notice and focus on areas that need improvement. You might need to drill over a certain section of the dance, or work on a general skill, like being more precise or picking up your speed. It might take you up to a week or more to get down the dance perfectly, so be patient with yourself! Focus on improving a little bit every day. 4. Do the full dance at least once every few days to keep it fresh. Congratulations--you’ve learned a whole K-pop dance! If you want it to stick, make sure to practice every few days.	.

Scrub the grill grates with a grill brush. Before starting your cleaning routine, use a grill brush to scrub any leftover residue from the grill. A good grill brush has wire bristles that will remove any burnt food and some of the rust. * To get off more residue, heat up the grill before scrubbing it. Make sure you wear oven mitts while you do this to avoid burning yourself! 2. Fill a large bucket with hot water, dish soap, and baking soda. Get a bucket large enough to fit your grill grates. Then pour in some hot water until the bucket is almost full. Add in of dish soap and of baking soda. Baking soda is a mild abrasive, so it will do a great job getting that rust off your grill. Mix it together until it forms a paste. * You can also use vinegar with dish soap in the same way. Use whatever ingredient you have in your house. 3. Remove the grill grates and soak them in the bucket for 1 hour. If your grill grates are removable, take them off the grill and put them in your bucket. Let it soak in the baking soda mixture for at least 1 hour. This will allow the baking soda and soap to penetrate and loosen the rust. * If your grill grates are too large to submerge in a bucket, just scrub the baking soda mixture on the grill with a brush. 4. Scrub the grill grates with a grill brush and rinse with cool water. After your grates have soaked for an hour, scrub off the rust with the grill brush. Since you let the rust sit in the baking soda, it should come off easily.	.

Note that deferment is temporary. If you are struggling to make payments on your student loans, you need to recognize that deferment is only a short-term solution. Your loans are not “forgiven,” and you will have to make your payments again once your designated deferment period is over. 2. Remember that interest will continue to accrue on your unsubsidized loans. During a deferment, the government will cover the interest on your subsidized loans, but if you have unsubsidized loans (including PLUS loans), interest will continue to accumulate. You don’t have to pay that interest during the deferment period, but ultimately, it will be added to your balance, and you’ll pay more over time. * If you are unsure how much of your loan balance is unsubsidized, visit the National Student Loan Data System here. This site will give you a complete breakdown of all your federal student loans, and you’ll be able to see which are subsidized and which are unsubsidized. 3. Determine whether you meet the requirements for an “in school” deferment.	This deferment will last until you graduate, quit the program, or drop below half-time enrollment.
Deal_With_Impossible_People.txt	Inside_Revision	0.859	## Tips	45035	"""""""When he / she whispers something negative to you in public , just say out loud , """""""" Do you really want to discuss this here ?"""""""	### Handling Conflicts	50524	"""""""If he / she whispers something negative to you in public , just say out loud , """""""" Do you really want to discuss this here ?"""""""	<replace><When><1><If><1>	True	"Tips  * Note that the most healthy way to deal with an impossible person is to remove that person from your environment. Do not torture yourself by exposing yourself to a destructive person. Do not put up with it. You are worth more than that. Remember that you cannot ""fix"" this person. * If nothing else helps, resolve to treat your experiences with impossible people as valuable life lessons. Realize that after dealing with them for a while, getting along with everyone else will be easier. You are getting a free education about how to deal with the most difficult people. Although it is unpleasant now, the lessons you learn are going to be valuable later in life. * Don't let them be the martyr that brings you down either. It is a real source of frustration to have a difficult person ""play the martyr"" around you to arouse your feelings of guilt and confusion. Beware this tactic and stand aside from them as they serve as their own martyr without you cementing their choice by fawning over them or conceding to their behavior. * Forget about him/her, even if you cannot avoid him/her. Remember that stressing about him/her all the time is the same as giving him/her your precious time when they don't even care about you. Do other activities and make new friends, that way you aren't wasting precious time by thinking about him/her constantly. * Do not judge this person as right or wrong no matter how irrational they seem because it will only make you feel worse. The less emotionally involved in what this person does the better you will be able manage. * If the person you're talking with is getting on your last nerve, take a breather. Remember, they might just want to get a rise out of you so show them that they have no effect on you. Count to ten silently if you need to, and then state your views with confidence. Look them in the eye. If you look at the ground or over their shoulder, they will interpret this as weak. If the person is still being impossible, then just ignore them. That person will eventually back down if they notice that they're not aggravating you. * Avoid arguing at all costs because this will only trigger your fight or flight responses making it harder to think clearly. * Be detached from anything they say whether it's a compliment or criticism. If you give them power to build you up, then you also give them power to knock you down. Learn to develop a sense of self worth from within. * Be aware that all of us exhibit some of these personality ""disorders"" to some degree. It's just a question of how you define ""normal"". * People with histrionic personality disorders, regardless of whether they happen to be male or female, are often referred to as “drama queens.” They live for attention, and will frequently go to great lengths in order to get it. They have to live in the right neighborhood, wear the right clothes, and send their kids to the right schools. * Passive-aggressive people express their hostilities indirectly by pushing other people’s buttons without appearing to do so — like the dinner guest who exclaims innocently, ""Wonderful meal, folks. I had no idea how delicious the cheaper cuts of meat could be!"" or the sneaky ""Don't worry about me, I'm fine,"" when you know perfectly well that if you say, ""Okay,"" and go on with whatever you were doing, there are going to be problems to deal with later because he/she is most definitely not fine, and you should have known that. * Don't disagree with them; find ways to be agreeable even if they are wrong. When they tell you that you donated the money for attention or whatever else, you can say that they might be right. Agreeing with impossible people sidetracks their steam as they continually look for arguments. You could even smile a bit as you agree with them, thus maintaining your good humor and away from falling back into anger. * If you think that you are impossible, good job for realizing it! Learn to look at other people's opinions with an open mind. You are allowed to have your own, but recognize that just because an opinion is yours does not make it automatically right. * Make sure you do not make impossible people angry; although they usually (of course) ""have no temper"" and are ""reasonable to everybody,"" the fact is that if you enrage them, they will blow their stack like you can't believe. Your own moments of frustration with them will pale in comparison. Don't give them a reason. Instead, think of their outbursts in the same way you would a child's tantrum, but do it subtly (in such a way that they can't lash out at you for being ""condescending""). This takes practice, but it is a social skill worth developing. It might help to think of this person as having a health problem: this person needs help, needs constant management, and you may not be able to do it alone. * If for some reason you are able to convince impossible people with irrefutable evidence that they (and they alone) are at fault, then there is a possibility that they will completely ""crash"" in the other direction, expressing the belief that if they can't be right in this one situation, then they must be 100% wrong all the time in every situation. This is a coping mechanism of theirs which attempts to encourage others around them to feel sympathy for them and build them back up. * When you make your escape from the impossible person stay away. Don't ever go back once you break away -- no matter how much you love them or they say they've changed. * Never tell others how you feel about this person. If you confess the impossible behavior of this impossible person, and the person you tell shares the same views as you have, then it is quite possible that this person might spread the chat you had with him/her. Then, when it reaches the ears of the impossible person in this case, regardless of the means by which this knowledge reaches him, s/he will make every possible attempt to degrade your image, because then s/he will know who started it. * Try to focus on the positive, even if you can't seem to think of anything. Something as simple as ""God loves him/her"" can keep you under control, even if you don't love them yourself. * Don't become a martyr. Before you attempt to deal with impossible people yourself, you may have to learn how tocontrol your own emotions. If you are simply unable to avoid an impossible person due to work, family, or other reasons, it is especially important to find other interests, join a support group, and seek therapy or religious counseling if necessary. * When the impossible person is abusing or slandering you, other people will start to show sympathy towards you. You don't need to do anything to make them look bad; she/he just digs his/her grave with no help from you. If s/he is angering you, others are also likely to be annoyed. * Ignore them. How better to undermine someone who wants to rant and rave in order to seek attention than to not give them the attention they want? If they cannot get your attention they will move on to someone else who will give them the attention they crave. Don't let it be you. * It may also help to call a spade a spade and realize that you are dealing with an emotional abuser. More helpful information can be found in literature on that topic. * Be kind and friendly even though they may act like a jerk to receive negative attention. If they are lonely but don't know how to get attention, then they will appreciate what you are doing and change. If they are just natural jerks who love to make others mad, then what you are doing will enrage them because they can't figure out how to make you mad, and eventually they will leave you alone. Love is crucial, even if it is insanely difficult to perform in various situations. * Don't keep taking the abuse. Write down some thoughts. Figure out some numbers. Get your wants and needs right in your head. Then have them sit down and start talking. If they interrupt, stop them and continue your talk, with complete honesty and frankness until you are finished. Give ultimatums if you have too, but remind them of the benefits of staying (and losing the bad behavior), or of losing a very beneficial position. Put the cards on their table. Make the choice theirs. They just may realize that they've got it pretty good, and decide that staying, and changing, just may be the right way to go. But if the behavior continues? Out the door immediately, no ifs ands or buts. * Don't argue or try to stand up to the person, just smile and nod to whatever they say. It will help you get them off your back If you can't avoid them. Stay out of their business, out of their way, and avoid talking to or about them. Sometimes you just need to suck it up and do as they say or whatever they want you to do. * If you are in a position where you just can't leave, treat your situation like a game. Learn their strategy and develop counter strategies ahead of time. Just avoid taking them too far and becoming controlling yourself. Also know what the possible consequences there may be as a result of your actions so you can prepare for those too. If they still find a way to get to you, then don't feel bad. Just make a note of what happened and devise new strategies for that the next time. Eventually you'll find what works and what doesn't and you'll probably feel better as you realize you're 3 steps ahead outwitting them at every turn. Impossible people aren't so impossible when you can predict what they're going to say or do next. They'll just seem kind of sad. Just remember your ultimate goal is to help free yourself mentally, not become their master. * Become aware of your body language when around these people. Speak softly, and move calmly. We reveal a lot of our emotions nonverbally. You don't want to reveal your own feelings unknowingly to these people. Also this will help you maintain your own sense of calm, and will probably have a calming effect on them in the process. * It's important to keep perspective. Recognize that you are not alone. These situations are not rare or exceptional in any way. Consider that everyone we encounter in life is just at different levels in their thinking than you are. What's seemingly crazy to us may be another person's only way of coping in the world. Simply put, they may not be able for whatever reason to see or think as you even if they wanted to. Also do not be misled by a person's age, intelligence, or station in life to determine their maturity. We all have our own unique fears, beliefs, life experiences, goals, or ideals that make us who we are. Taking that into account we can figure out what we are willing or unwilling to give. *"	Hopefully, this will discourage them from extending the negativity within earshot of others.

Find Canary Mary again. At 45 Jiggies, you'll be able to take on Jiggywiggy's Challenge 8. After the very long ride up to the clouds, go underwater to the right of the ""Sack Pack"" move in the Central Cavern, and take flight from the flight pad on a ledge next to the pool outside. 2. Fly around the giant middle island until you find a small floating island with Wumba's Wigwam on it. Assuming you've already completed Part 1, Canary Mary will be hanging out nearby. This time will be no different, after hopping on the newly fixed clockwork mouse she'll tell you to mash A on the Nintendo 64 or X on the Xbox 360/One to race her. 3. Race Canary Mary for another Jiggy. This time Mary is feeling much better, but the race difficulty really depends on your version. * On the Nintendo 64, you'll pretty much be able to defeat her by mashing as fast as possible, or possibly using tactics from the first two races. * On the Xbox 360/One version, however, things get tricky. If you don't feel like whipping out an electric screwdriver, spoon or pencil, then try to win by mashing the X button at a steady pace to keep a little bit behind her the entire race, and this is not an easy feat- if you get a little bit ahead of her, she'll suddenly boost so fast, you have no chance anymore. 4. Use two fingers, one from each hand. Alternate them onto the button at a steady pace, and when you're coming around the final stretch, feel free to mash as fast as possible, pass her, and win in a landslide. (Or you could just mash like Mary tells you, but while it's possible to win like this, it is extremely difficult on the Xbox 360/One version.) 5. Race Canary Mary again for another Cheato Page. If you're a Nintendo 64 user, you can do exactly what you did in the last race, and you should be fine. But Xbox players (and troubled N64 players) will need a very specific strategy. 6. Keep going. As the race starts, Mary is very forgiving, and will allow you to get ahead quickly, but after some time with you in the lead, she will rubber band back ahead of you and give you no chance. Instead, mash like in the last race and keep right behind her for most of the race. You may want to break every now and then. 7. Pass the giant Zubba statue. Continue your steady mashing pace cautiously until a sudden camera change: you'll start watching the competitors from below. And when this happens, start counting down eight seconds. And after counting to eight, stop mashing for three seconds and let Mary pass."	.

Buy seeds and supplies. Choose whether to start your garden from seeds or sprouted seedlings and purchase them from a catalog or nursery. You'll also need to decide what garden tools you need to buy. A lot of gardening work can be done by hand with simple tools, but if you plan on having a large garden, your life will be a lot easier if you get a tilling machine to help you loosen the soil. Here's what you'll need: * Seeds or seedlings. Many nurseries have great selections of both, as well as staff who can help you figure out which varieties to buy. If you choose to start your garden from seedlings, buy them no more than a few days before you intend to plant them. * Fertilizer. A good natural fertilizer will give your vegetable plants an extra boost. Get bone meal, blood meal or a fertilizer mix to work into the soil. Compost also works quite well. * Mulch and topsoil. Vegetable plants need to be protected from wind and heavy rain when they're first planted. Determine whether mulch or simply a fine layer of topsoil is required. You could also use loose hay to protect the sprouting plants. 2. A soil tiller. This machine is used to loosen dirt, allowing you to mix in fertilizer and dig holes for the vegetable plants. For a small garden, you could simple use a hoe and your own elbow grease, but you might want to buy or rent a soil tiller for a garden more than about 10 square feet. * A shovel, a spade, and a garden rake. These are used to dig holes and move plants and soil around, and are essential gardening tools. * A ruler or measuring tape. Since vegetable plants need to be planted at different depths, it's useful to have a ruler on hand to measure the holes you make. * A hose with an adjustable watering feature. Having the ability to change the water pressure comes in handy. * Fencing supplies. Creatures like rabbits, squirrels, deer and other animals like to nibble on vegetables, so you may want to construct a fence around your garden. 3. Get the soil ready. Mark the corners of the garden area you laid out with rocks. Clear the area within the borders free of roots, rocks, sticks, weeds, and other large debris. Use the soil tiller or a garden hoe or rake to break up the soil into small pieces, working it to a depth of about , depending on how deep your vegetables need to be planted. * If you're using fertilizer, work it into the soil with a garden rake. Be sure to distribute it evenly. * Be sure to take the time to remove large rocks that are buried in the dirt. They'll get in the way of your plants' roots, and it's worth taking the time to clear the area. * If you're concerned about the quality of the dirt in your yard, buy a soil testing kit to find out how many nutrients and organic matter it contains, as well as its pH level. All of these factors determine how well vegetables grow and how nutritious they will be.	.
Deep_Fry_a_Turkey.txt	Inside_Revision	0.528	## Steps	408	If the oil has reached 350 ° F ( 175 ° C ) , you 're ready to fry .	## Steps	2761	Once the oil has reached 350 ° F ( 175 ° C ) , you 're ready to fry .	<replace><If><1><Once><1>	True	Steps  1. Season the turkey. Begin by sprinkling the cayenne pepper over the top of the turkey, and around the legs, rubbing it in as you go. Then turn it on its side, sprinkle more cayenne and rub it in. Completely turn the turkey over upside down and sprinkle and rub the underside. Continue until the entire body has been well covered and rubbed. * There are many different ways to season the turkey, so feel free to look up recipes. Most of them involve rubbing the turkey with seasoning or injecting with marinade. 2. Make the metal handle. This method is recommended if you do not have a deep drying basket.. Place the turkey on its head and begin to spear the wire through it, just underneath the breast, by the wings. Carefully pull the wire through, loop the wire around about three times to make a metal handle. Twist the ends of the wire around your handle so there are no sharp ends. It is very important to do a little test to make sure that your handle it totally secure when lifting up the turkey. Only when you are convinced that the handle is strong enough should you move onto the next step. 3. Prepare the burner. The frying of the turkey must be done outside, in a dry and well ventilated area. Set the gas burner on a level, grass surface, as this is one of the safest options so that the fryer doesn't tip over. Keep the propane tank as far away from the fryer as possible, and make sure it is not on, under or near any flammable materials (wooden deck, roof, tree, etc.). When not set up properly, a deep fryer can explode, setting houses and buildings on fire. Read the instructions that came with your fryer. 4. Prepare the oil level. Half fill the pot with water. Then roughly half fill the bucket with water, which should represent the same weight as your turkey. Place the bucket into the pot to make sure the water does not go past the top of the bucket. If it does, then discard some of the water. The water line will represent the quantity of oil you will need, so make a note of it. Then remove the bucket and tip away the water from the pot. * Alternatively, you can put the turkey itself in the empty pot and add enough water to just cover (1-2 inches above) the turkey. Take the turkey out and measure the depth of the water with a ruler. 5. Dry the pot. It is extremely important to thoroughly wipe the pot dry with some kitchen roll. You must not leave any water in the pot as hot oil and water can be a very dangerous combination! 6. Add the oil. Pour the oil into the pot to the level where the water was. Then light your gas burner to a high setting and place the pot carefully down onto the burner plate. Place the thermometer into the oil and allow the oil to heat to a temperature of 350 °F (175 °C). This should roughly take 45 minutes to an hour. In the meantime, put on your protective jacket/apron as well as your gloves. You may also wish to put on safety goggles to keep oil from splashing in your eyes. 7. Check the temperature. After 45 minutes, look at the gauge to see how hot the oil is. Make sure you have on your protective gloves and jacket.	With the metal hook attached to the wire loop handle of your turkey, lower the turkey with extreme care into the hot oil. Do this very slowly and be aware of any hot splashing oil! It is safer to turn off the burner while the turkey is being submerged, then immediately turn it back on once the turkey is in.

Determine if a fainting spell is approaching. Be aware that most fainting spell occur when you are standing. There are a number of symptoms that you may experience immediately before fainting, known as pre-syncope. Recognizing these warning signs will help you prepare yourself if you do indeed faint, but it can also help to prevent a fainting episode. Furthermore, awareness of typical symptoms will help you stay safe if you do faint. * Common symptoms include yawning, a sudden sweat, nausea (sickness), fast and deep breathing, confusion, lightheadedness, blurred vision or spots in front of your eyes, and ringing in your ears. 2. React quickly to the symptoms. The symptoms of fainting can come on very quickly and with little warning. If you experience the above symptoms, it is a good idea to conduct 'antigravity' measures. 'Antigravity' measures can possibly help you avoid a fainting episode. * Medical experts suggest that you lie down or sit down and place you head between your knees. These positions will help restore blood flow to the brain, and either prevent fainting or help you regain consciousness quickly. *	This is particularly effective if you experience symptoms in a crowded place where you are unable to lie down immediately.

Establish a snack plan. By creating a snack plan, you’ll have an idea of what healthy snacks you’ll give to your toddler over the course of a week. Thus, you’ll be able to make sure you have all the ingredients you need. * Plan to provide 3 snacks every day, in addition to 3 meals. This way, your toddler will be eating something every 2 or 3 hours. * Vary your snacks throughout the day. If you provide a dairy-heavy snack in the morning, focus on vegetables on fruits in the afternoon. * Map out your snacks for the entire week. For instance, sit down at the beginning of the weak and plan all your snacks. 2. Include whole grains. Whole grains an important part of creating a balance snack menu for your toddler. They are also a great source of fiber for toddlers and adults alike. Thus, you should focus on whole grains when providing your toddler with snacks. Remember: * To think about whole grain crackers and similar snacks. Rice cakes are another good snack. * To use whole wheat bread when making any sort of snack. * To look for whole grain cereals free from added sugar (or with very little added sugar). 3. Provide only quality dairy products. Snacks that include dairy are important because they contain calcium, iron, and other important vitamins. Thus, you need to make sure you include dairy products in your snack plan. * Your child should have three servings of dairy a day. When it comes to processed cheese, this equates to 1 slice, 1 string mini string cheese, and 1 mini baby bell. Feel free to include these in your toddler’s snacks. * 1 small pot (about 125 ml) of yogurt makes for a great snack. At the same time, you can serve half of a small pot of yogurt with fruit or vegetables. * Consider providing your child with a 3 or 4 ounce cup (100 to 120 ml) of milk with their snack. Use semi skimmed milk for toddlers over 2 years old. 4. Limit meat intake. Like dairy, meat is an important source of iron and other vitamins that toddlers need.	However, you should also limit the amount of meat and type of meat your toddler consumes.

List the times when your friend has used or wronged you. Think back over your relationship and try to identify whether there has been a lack of conscience or guilt on your friend's part. To help clear your thoughts, write down the facts and your feelings for each moment when you felt wronged. There may be trends or correlations. * For instance, note the time your friend got you both a failing grade by copying off your exam, then blamed you for not making your test easier for them to see. 2. See the true nature of your friendship for what it is. Don’t let sorrow or embarrassment cloud what your collected evidence tells you. It’s natural to be in denial, as your friend's apparent sociopathy will be hard to swallow. But the sooner you accept the reality of the situation, the sooner you can address it honestly. * You can rightly feel upset if you have been abused and manipulated. But don’t feel ashamed — many sociopaths are expert abusers and manipulators. * Your friend may not be a ""friend"" in the normal sense. It’s not entirely clear whether a true sociopath can ever really be a friend — some experts say they can’t truly experience emotions like caring, while others disagree. You’ll have to work out the unique circumstances of your friend and your friendship. 3. Tell your friend your concerns and evaluate their reaction. Be calm and explain your reasoning in straight facts. Be honest, and don't try to make things sound better than you actually feel they are. Don't sell yourself short. * For example: “John, I now recognize that there’s a pattern of you lying to me and not caring about how your actions have harmed me. Let me mention some examples.…” * Sociopaths may become verbally aggressive when their integrity is questioned. Instead of fighting the facts you present, they may attack your qualifications or motives (“Are you trying to say I’m a sociopath? — you’re not a psychiatrist!” or “Why are you trying to hurt me with these wild accusations?”). Remain calm and stay on message. 4. Refuse to feel guilty for being honest. When confronted, the sociopath may seek to make you feel sorry for them."	.

Even if you choose not to immediately leave the relationship, it is important to have someone else be aware in case of an emergency. You may wish to all set up a safe word or code word to be used if you need them to contact help for you. 3. Collect important documents and store them in a safe place. These documents include social security cards, birth certificates, marriage licenses, and any other legal documents with your name appearing on them. If children are involved, have their personal information as well. If you are unable to store the originals, you may wish to make copies of them and store those. 4. Prepare a suitcase in the event that you have to immediately leave your home. You can keep your documents in this suitcase and may wish to have a few changes of clothing. Keep this bag outside of the home, preferably at the home of a trusted person, in the trunk of your car, or in a storage locker. 5. Purchase a cellular phone for emergencies only. Almost all cellular telephones will have emergency service access even without a phone plan. Keep this phone charged and ready in case you need to call the authorities and are unable to use the telephone in your home. If possible, keep the phone on a charger that is not readily visible to your partner and in a safe area. 6. Open your own bank account. Have an account where funds are immediately available to you. If you do not work outside of the home, this step may be difficult. In that case, you may be able to get financial assistance through government organizations once you leave your home permanently. You may wish to keep all records of this separate account from your partner. 7. Document all acts of domestic abuse that you have experienced within the relationship.	Be aware that you may need to explain why you choose to stay in harm's way and not seek help for the unreported episodes.

Open the mouth and check the jaw for alignment, clicking, or fracture. Look for chipped or lost teeth and damage to the tongue. You should also look at the cheek bones for fracture and bruising. Look into the pupils of the eyes to evaluate their size (in millimeters), whether they're equal, and if they're reacting to light. * Be thorough when checking. For example, you'll want to look behind the ears for bruising and inside the ear canals and nostrils (using an otoscope) for bleeding. 2. Place a cervical collar around the neck.

Defend_Yourself_in_Court.txt	Begin_Revision	0.926	### Representing Yourself in Criminal Court	6933	For example , you may agree to plead guilty to a single charge and in return the prosecution will drop any other charges they have against you .	### Representing Yourself in Criminal Court	7059	Also , you may agree to plead guilty to a single charge and in return the prosecution will drop any other charges they have against you .	<delete><For><1>|||<replace><example><2><Also><1>	True	Representing Yourself in Criminal Court  1. Actively take part in your arraignment. The first time you will have to represent yourself in criminal court will be at your arraignment. At your arraignment the court will tell you what the charges against you are, what your constitutional rights are, and that you have the right to an attorney. Once the judge has said their piece, you will have the opportunity to respond to the charges by entering a plea. You will have to respond by saying not guilty, guilty, or no contest. Most often you will want to plead not guilty and force the prosecution to go to trial and prove their case. However, in some situations, especially if you have negotiated a favorable plea agreement, you may end up pleading guilty or no contest. * If you have been in jail awaiting your arraignment, you will also have the opportunity to discuss bail options. The judge will generally have the ability to release you on your own recognizance, set bail and send you back to jail until you post the required amount, or refuse to set bail and send you back to jail without the possibility of being released. 2. Request evidence from the prosecutor. After your arraignment, you will exchange information with the prosecution. This process is called discovery. The prosecution is usually required to provide you with certain information to ensure a fair trial and balance the scales because you will inevitably have a harder time finding information that the prosecution might hold. In general, you as the defendant will have to request the information. You should be sure to request any oral or written statements you may have made, your criminal record, any reports, expert witness names and contact information, and you should request to examine any object or document the prosecution might have. * However, because you are representing yourself, you may be limited in the amount of information you can see. Prosecutors are required by law to protect the identity of witnesses while they are preparing their case so the witnesses are not put in jeopardy. This is one of the reasons you should seriously consider getting an attorney. If you have an attorney, the prosecutor will be required to release information to them that they may not have to release to you. 3. Investigate your case. After you have received all of the documents you requested, you should begin the process of investigating your case. If you are not in jail, you can call, email, or talk to people in person to try and gather more information about your case. If you are in jail, you will need the assistance of someone else. While you may be able to send letters and make phone calls, investigating a case while you are locked up can prove difficult. * As a criminal defendant, you have to be careful not to be seen as intimidating or threatening witnesses or victims. In fact, if you are going to try and interview witnesses or victims, you should hire a professional to do so. 4. Research the relevant law. In order to defend yourself in court, you must understand the legal claims or charges against you and prepare your legal defense. This requires that you research the law related to your case and strategize on how best to defend yourself based on the legal claims against you. You can gain access to legal resources in the following places: * You can use local law libraries open to the public. To locate a local library, conduct an internet search for the name of your city or town and law library and “open to the public.” You can ask the law librarian to direct you to the legal resources you need. * You can search for local state laws and statutes online at: http://www.findlaw.com/11stategov/indexcode.html. * You can also use free online legal research websites to locate legal information to assist in your defense. * If you are in jail, you can ask to access the jail's legal library, if they have one. If they do not have any legal books at jail, you may need to ask for help from someone that is not in jail. 5. Attend all required preliminary hearings. In a majority of misdemeanor cases there are very few preliminary hearings, if any. Most of the time a trial date will be set and you will go straight to trial unless you negotiate a plea deal. In most felony cases, you will take part in at least one preliminary hearing before going to trial. At this preliminary hearing the judge will decide if there is enough evidence against you to make you appear in court for a trial. If the judge decides that there is not enough evidence, your case will be dismissed and you will be released. If the judge decides there is enough evidence to make you stand trial, you may be arraigned again and a trial date will be set. 6. Submit motions to exclude evidence. Before your trial date, you will have a limited amount of time to review the evidence against you and submit motions to the court to exclude any evidence that was gathered illegally. To do this, you must write and file a motion to suppress with the court. The judge will read your motion and decide whether to grant or deny it. * In general, evidence can be suppressed if it was gathered in a way that violated your constitutional rights. For example, a murder weapon cannot be introduced in court if it was found during an illegal search or seizure (i.e., the police did not have a warrant). However, there are a number of exceptions to this rule and if the prosecution can convince the judge that an exception exists, the evidence may still get in. 7. Negotiate a plea agreement. As a last ditch effort to avoid trial, you may want to negotiate with the prosecution about a possible plea deal. A plea deal is made when you and the prosecution agree to certain terms that you will submit to the court.	In another example, you may agree to plead guilty to a lesser charge in order to avoid going to trial on a more serious charge.

Acknowledge your child’s frustration. At one point or another, every child becomes frustrated with their homework. At times, they may explode with anger, or become extremely sad or anxious. Keep in mind that your child needs your support, as their behavior likely reflects a feeling of helplessness that they are unable to fully process. * Instead of becoming frustrated yourself, try talking to your child calmly. Start with a brief, sympathetic statement. * For instance, say “I’m sorry your homework is stressful today,” or “I know it can be frustrating when an assignment is hard to understand.” 2. Recommend a break. While you will want to revisit a frustrating homework assignment, you and your child will be able to communicate better when you’re both calm. Especially in cases where a child loses their temper or becomes visibly upset, say something like, “Lindsay, how about you take a break from that for a few minutes. We can look at it together when you’re ready to give it another try.” 3. Make yourself available once everyone has calmed down. You may find yourself getting worked up when your child becomes frustrated. If you feel yourself start to become agitated, don’t try to start a conversation, as the situation will likely escalate. To help you both calm down, ask them if they’ll take a few deep breaths with you. * Direct them to breathe in through their nose deeply and slowly for five seconds, and then release slowly through their mouth. *	.

Scope out the scene to get a feel for how people are dancing. Before heading to the dance floor, do a lap around the club to check out what's going on. Take in your surroundings, watch other people dancing, and get a feel for the music. Getting comfortable with your surroundings can cut any nervousness you may be feeling. * Also, check out where people are just hanging out and talking. 2. Listen to the music to find the beat. Rather than focusing on what moves you should bust out, take a moment to listen to the song that's playing and notice the beat. Once you've found the beat, start bobbing your head to the music. Finding the rhythm will help you out when you start dancing. * If you're having trouble finding the beat, watch the people dancing. Most of them will be moving in time to the beat. 3. Find a spot on the dance floor and have fun. Pick a place to slide yourself onto the dance floor. Find a little space, and start using your moves. Bob your head, try a step-touch move, or simply bounce in place. As long as you're having fun, it doesn't really matter what moves you do! * Let yourself just move along to the beat. * If you're a little self-conscious, try copying other people's dance moves. 4. Have a good time but don't get too wild with your moves.	Avoid accidentally hitting people with your arms and elbows, for instance, by keeping your dance moves under control.

Hair products: It will be easier to style and manage your hair when you use the right products. Do some research and think about what hair type you may have. Using the right products is very important to keeping your thick hair healthy. If you are unsure of what products will work best for you, ask a friend or try experimenting yourself. When hair is healthy, it is easier to manipulate and style in a variety of ways. 2. The layered look: If you can't stand your think hair, consider getting it thinned out with layers. If your hair is naturally curly this will bring out your natural curls. If you hair is straight getting layers will make it seem 'choppy' and will give it shape. Thick hair can be much easier to manage and style when it has layers. Layers will also make your hair seem lighter and thinner, so if this is what you are looking for, give it a go. 3. The 'Pinned back' technique: Sometimes, having thick hair can cause your hair to look plain and shapeless.	To achieve this look, grab a small amount of hair near the front of your face, pull it back and secure it with a pin. Do this one both sides of your hair to create a hairstyle with great shape. To add extra style to this, try plating the small amount of hair before pinning it back.

Know the way that Amy sings her songs. She sings only in chest voice, except when singing a big note, she switches to head voice. Keep that in mind when singing. Hitting a big note in chest voice will not only strain your voice, but also make it crack. 2. Know which notes are too big for you. Don't try to hit a huge note, like the one at the end of Lithium, when you don't have a very big voice. 3. Find your vocal range. Don't deny it, you probably can't hit that low note in Snow White Queen, or the high one in Your Star. Adjust the notes that are too big or too small to suit your range. 4. Learn to hold long notes. In My Heart Is Broken, for example, you have to hold a lot of long notes. Practice holding notes by singing a single note and timing how long you can hold it. Make sure that when practicing, you hold notes with vibrato. You wouldn't want to hurt your voice. 5. Learn to expand your voice. Open your mouth a bit more to sing some bigger notes, like when she sings ""right beside you forevermore"" in Like You. Don't try singing that in chest voice. You will strain too much. Really let loose and release those notes to their fullest. 6. Adjust the key to suit your voice. If you are a guy, lower the key of the song slightly so you won't hurt your voice. If the song is too low for you, make it slightly higher. Just don't change the key too dramatically, you will sound off key. 7. Really focus on the way you sing the notes. Think about the original song while you sing your cover. Make your notes as similar to those of the real song as you can."	Sing the notes that you can sing the same the same, and change the ones you can't to fit your voice.

Know your diamonds. Diamonds tend to be the traditional engagement ring choice, because they are enduring, and match everything. Diamonds are the hardest material that’s why it’s suitable as a gemstone for diamond solitaire engagement rings. They don’t lose their polish and they are resistant to scratching. The only way for diamonds to be scratched is by other diamonds. As engagement and wedding rings are worn daily people prefer diamonds which suit perfectly for every day wear due to its above mentioned properties. Only deviate from a diamond if you know that your girlfriend loves another stone much, much more, or has voiced her intense dislike of diamonds. When choosing a diamond, be aware of the following 4 C's of diamonds. 2. Use ""carats"" to determine the weight or general size. Carats refer to the unit measurement of the diamond, and refers to weight, rather than size. Carats are broken down into 100 ‘points’, which are essentially a measurement of the percentage of a carat that a diamond is. For example if a diamond is 75pt then it is 75%, or 0.75 of a carat. Higher carat ratings generally mean larger diamonds, and are more expensive. 3. Consider if you want a clear or colored diamond. The color of diamonds varies considerably and most people prefer a white colored diamond for an engagement ring. Colors are graded from D (colorless and rare) and most good quality diamonds will be around F and H. However, all grades from D to I are almost identical when mounted. 4. Keep an eye on the diamond's clarity."	"These are known as ‘inclusions’ and come from tiny impurities being present when the diamond was formed, millions of years ago. The less imperfections, the greater the clarity and the more light is reflected from the diamond, causing it to ""sparkle"". Naturally, more clarity increases its value. Perfectly flawless diamonds with no internal flaws or surface blemishes are very hard to find as they are extremely rare."

Look for rotting food. As a dog-owner, you’ve probably learned that your dog will eat just about anything. Unfortunately, this includes rotten. Look around your house for any rotten food he may have gotten into, including the dead bodies of vermin or other animals out in the yard. If you suspect this is the case, watch him closely for signs of deteriorating health. 2. Recall if he’s come into contact with other dogs. Just like kids passing around a cold at school, dogs can pass illness back and forth when they come into contact. Has your dog recently played with a dog that is now ill with vomiting or diarrhea? If so, talk to that dog's owner about how ill the dog is and how long he took to recover. This could help you to know if a trip to the vet's may be necessary. * If you take your dog to a dog park, it may be difficult to find out whether or not any of the dogs have been sick recently. Do your best to talk to the other owners. Ask if anyone’s heard of any sick dogs lately. 3. Consider your dog’s underlying health issues. Some conditions, such as pancreatitis, are associated with frequent stomachaches. If your dog has a condition you’re already aware of, monitor him closely for signs of deterioration. These might include loss of energy, sickness, or diarrhea. Early treatment by a veterinarian can lessen the severity of the episode. *	If you think your dog has even a simple case of indigestion, contact your veterinarian for advice.

When displaying your interest to an Aries female, be friendly, forthright, and light. Make jokes, and treat her platonically. She will let you know right off the bat if she's attracted to you sexually, whether with her words or body language. Arians in general are unskilled at keeping secrets, no matter how hard they try. It's likely that if an Aries woman likes you, you'll know. You may sometimes come across an Aries woman who seems shy, open up to her and she will unfold before you. 2. When approaching her for a date, be confident, make eye contact, and smile. Aries women tend to be active and outdoor-type, so suggesting a short hike or a morning run, or even taking a challenging yoga class together might pique her interest. 3. Listen to her. The motto for the sign of Aries is ""I am"", and you'll understand why within the first few minutes of conversation. An Aries woman is a creature of her own mind, and often gets caught up on the nuances of her own identity and life goals. Provide positive feedback when prompted, and add in your own two cents if you have it. Aries women appreciate constructive advice on their life paths and personality, but be careful how you phrase your words so as to not step on her toes emotionally. Also, do not expect her to follow your advice at all! This woman will march to the beat of her own drum, with or without you in her life. 4. When talking about yourself, be as honest and forthright as possible. Don't try to play mind games or conceal parts of your character. Aries women abhor dishonesty and duplicity, and will dump you on your ass so fast your head will spin if they suspect that you're being less than straight with them. Do play up your accomplishments, and talk about your future aspirations. Aries women are very loyal friends and companions, and if they think your goals are worthwhile, they love to help out, if they can. 5. Don't be clingy. The Aries woman often has a very full life, many friends, and devotes a lot of energy to her own pursuits. Let her set the pace for your relationship. Nurture a strong element of friendship and spontaneity when you are together, keep things fun and interesting by trying new things together, working on something together, or engaging in friendly competition. 6. A woman born between March 21st and April 20th is characteristically very strong, loyal, level headed and focused about her goals. Some might say she appears rude at first, but try not to judge her too quickly in the initial encounters. Try to look beyond the first impression when you are dealing with females who are of the sun sign Aries. 7. These women are very sentimental and sensitive. Understand their complicated emotions that are tied and mixed up in their minds. These women are far from cold if that is what you think about them, it is due to the fact they take time to accept changes. In fact these women are warm hearted, extremely loyal and affectionate. 8. Trust has always been an issue for those born under the sign of Aries. Because they say what they mean, with no holds barred, they expect everyone else to speak the truth also. And they never seem to learn."	"This does not change their tendency to place trust too soon, and in all the wrong places, but sometimes it can cause them to ""hope for the best but expect the worst"". Some Aries women are somewhat closed and shy. This may create the impression that she is an introvert, but once you have gained her trust you will see that she is very much a natural extrovert."

Do you really want to be sitting on and around your little sibling's toys or wrappers? 3. Get some rest. You don't want to be overly tired during the ride. 6 hours of sleep should be plenty. An alternative is not getting much sleep so that you can rest during the car ride (this is only recommended for very long car rides). 4. Bring magazines or books. Buy a few books and/or magazines before you go, reading also helps time pass, and puts you into another world. 5. Bring games to play. Whether it's card games to your Nintendo DS. Let the fun begin! 6. Talk to the people with you! Discuss what you want to do as soon as you get to the destination, or talk about anything... It really passes the time. 7. If you have a DVD player or laptop, charge it before you go and bring some DVDs. Don't forget headphones or earphones though! The last thing you want is being forced to stop the DVD because it's too loud or inappropriate for a younger sibling. 8. Color in coloring books. Sure it sounds like something for little kids, but coloring something brightly, or adding things to a picture can really lighten your mood. 9. Avoid salty foods. Salty food will make you thirsty. And being thirsty means having to drink more water, which means going to the bathroom more often. Only eat salty foods if you know there will be a rest stop close by. 10. Make sure to stop at rest stops. Sitting in the car for 5 hours straight isn't healthy. Stretch, get a bite to eat, or go to the restroom! 11. Bring some snacks, along with bottled water. Staying hydrated is important.	.

Be aware that decongestant medicines and sprays can have some serious side effects. If you are on any medications or if you have a medical condition, then you should speak to your doctor before trying any over the counter medicines or nasal sprays. For example, if you have an enlarged prostate, glaucoma, heart disease, high blood pressure, or thyroid disease, check with your doctor or pharmacist before use because all decongestants, including sprays, can worsen these conditions. Your doctor can advise you on what medicines are and are not appropriate for you. Keep in mind that the potential side effects of decongestants include: * irritation to the lining of your nose * a skin rash * headaches * dry mouth * restlessness or anxiety * tremor (uncontrollable shaking and trembling) * problems sleeping (insomnia) * rapid and/or irregular heartbeat * noticing your heart beating inside your chest (palpitations) * increased blood pressure 2. Consider taking an over the counter decongestant. Over the counter decongestants (those not requiring a prescription) include phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine as main ingredients. They work by constricting the blood vessels in the nose. This reduces how much blood flows through the area so that swollen tissue inside the nose shrinks and air can pass through more easily. * Phenylephrine comes as a tablet, a liquid (spray), or a dissolving strip to take by mouth.	Follow directions on the bottle on its use.

Following these tips can reduce the risk, but they can't guarantee your safety, nor is it your fault if you aren't perfectly alert all the time. The actions of a dangerous man are his fault, never yours.  1. Learn basic self-defense practices. Self-defense is much more than just fighting back. It encompasses skills relating to becoming more aware of your surroundings, considering your options when in danger, practicing assertiveness, and attempting to de-escalate a potentially threatening situation. In reality, fighting back may actually make this guy more angry and result in you getting hurt. Sign up for a local self-defense class in which you can learn how to deflect violence and protect yourself in such situations. * In a tight situation, your ultimate goal is to get to safety. If you have no choice but to use physical violence, aim for the body parts in which you can inflict the most damage - and, therefore, have time to run away. Try to jab, punch, or kick the attacker in the eyes, nose, throat, crotch or knees. 2. Maintain control. Using alcohol or drugs in situations with people who you are not totally comfortable can leave you in a compromising position. Your defenses are down at these times, and you are less likely to be able to read your environment and anticipate threats. If you are just hanging out or beginning to date a new person, keep alcohol and drugs off the table. * A guy who does not want to take no for an answer wants to be in control. If alcohol and drugs are in the picture, you may mistakenly be giving this person more control to potentially drug you or coerce you into sex or other activities. 3. Be aware of what's out there about you on the internet. Many social media profiles display phone numbers and emails, which may be an opening for a creep to contact you. In the future, change your privacy settings so that your personal information is displayed only to those you trust (or no one at all). Also, be mindful of what you are posting online. Someone who means you harm has an easier time of locating you if you regularly tag yourself at different locations. 4. Avoid going to secluded places with people you don't know. If you are meeting a new guy for a blind date, choose to go somewhere public - and meet him at the location; don't give him your home address. Make sure someone else knows where you are at all times. If you can, try to set up a group or double date so that other friends are with you. 5. Remember that any acts of violence are his fault, not yours. It is his responsibility to act like a decent human being, not yours to be perfectly wary and watchful at every moment. If things go terribly wrong and someone does hurt you, it is not your fault. You have the right to say no, and it is his fault if he does not respect that. *	For example, if you're bothering him, there is no need for him to take no for an answer when he's protecting himself.

You can search for free stock photos on Google or use the very impressive website www.pexels.com to get the best free stock photos in one place. The one I am using in this article can be found on thesame website. 2. Now open the picture in Adobe Photoshop. Use rectangle tool (Keyboard Shortcut ‘U’) and draw a rough rectangle roughly the size of laptop screen. 3. You'll see a new layer called rectangle, right click on the layer and select 'Convert to Smart Object'. 4. Now on the top tool menu go to Edit>Free Transform (Keyboard Shortcut 'Ctrl+T') 5. Now again on the top tool menu go to Edit>Transform>Distort. 6. The last step allows you to move edges of the recangle freely to match the tilted laptop screen. Now click & hold any edge of rectangle and move it to match the related edge of the laptop screen. 7. Now repeat the above step with rest of the three edges to match all the four rectangle edges exactly with the laptop edges. To get better results zoom the image to match the edges. 8. Once the rectangle has pefactly overlaped the existing image on laptop screen. Your work is more than half done. Now we are just left to replace the rectangle which will be done in the following steps. 9. Now on the rectangle layer on your right click on the small icon on the bottom right. You'll see that a new tab will open and there will be an plain image in front of you. 10. Take a screenshot of the website you want to display on laptop screen.

See if your friend makes supportive comments. A true friend should make you feel needed, confident, and better about being alive. If your friend is always putting you down or making you feel worthless and never seems to give you a kind word when you really need it, then that friend is not true blue. If you want to know if your friend is a good friend, see if she makes comments that encourage you. * See if your friend compliments you. If your friend gives you genuine compliments from everything from your new outfit to your work ethic, then that friend is a good friend. If you can't remember the last time your friend complimented you, you may have a problem. * See if your friend encourages you. If your friend encourages you before a test, job interview, or even a first date, then that friend is a true friend. If your friend never gives you positive support, even when you really need it, then you may have a problem. * See if your friend is your cheerleader. Though your friend doesn't have to always cheer you on, if your friend is a good friend, then she should be your fan and should always root for you to succeed, no matter what you do. 2. See if your friend listens to you. If your friend is a true friend, then she should take the time to listen to what you have to say. In a true friendship, both people should be sharing their thoughts and getting feedback. If you find that your friend is always talking about his problems, but is bored or distracted as soon as it's time for you to share yours, then you may have a false friend on your hands. Here are some signs that your friend needs to brush up on his listening skills: * Notice how your friend reacts when you try to share something. If he nods, maintains eye contact, and supports you, then he's a good friend.	.

Decide between earbuds or headphones. * Earbuds are best for people who are short on space, but still want a way to listen to their music. The higher-quality earbuds, like from Sennheiser or Ultimate Ears, usually come with little cases to put your earbuds in when you're not using them, so they won't get ruined or dirty at the bottom of your bag. If you keep a very small purse and want to keep your iPod Nano and earbuds together in it, or you're a guy with limited pocket space, earbuds are probably a better choice. They're also great if you are on a limited budget, because there's a lot more to choose from and they tend to cost less. Cheaper earbuds often run into problems like falling out of ears, hurting ears, or simply making dents in them from the cheap plastic. With higher prices (but still low-end in terms of quality) ranging from $25-50, you'll get more comfortable 'buds, and they are well-worth the money you spend. However, if you're an audiophile, you should consider other options. A pair of buds from Sennheiser (like the CX 500, $130), Shure (SE 115, $120), EtyMotic Research (HF5, $150), or even Ultimate Ears (minimum Super.fi 4) will be preferable. * Headphones are great if you enjoy putting them around your neck while you're walking from one place to another, or if you just carry your headphones that way. You also tend to get beefier cords and fun options like wireless/bluetooth headphones. The drawback is that good headphones within your budget might be hard to find. They take up more space than earbuds, and the DJ-style headphones take up a ridiculous amount of space if you don't carry around a larger bag. They also are easy to get dirty because most don't come with cases for them. * DJ-style headphones are just that. Huge, bulky, awesome-looking headphones that are reminiscent of what you'd see someone named Double D mix his jams with. The structure lends itself to good sound containment but bad size usage. And a lot of music buffs get them because of the better sound quality and less pressure exuded on the eardrum, resulting in longer listening time and less damage to the eardrum. * Behind-the-neck headphones are exactly that as well, headphones with a connecting band that goes behind the neck instead of over the top of the head. Recommended for joggers or people who wear hats a lot. Also for sunglasses fanatics.	"Besides that, there are very few things that separate them from dj-style or ""regular"" headphones."

Let your feelings out; it's natural that you feel upset or even inconsolable. Some doctors say that dealing with the fact that a major life goal is suddenly closed to you is not different from dealing with grief, so you may really feel that you are ""in mourning,"" even if it's over the fact that your book deal didn't work out, or that your boyfriend broke up with you instead of proposing. It's perfectly natural to feel incredibly upset and pained, so acknowledge and accept your pain in the beginning. * Don't be ashamed to cry or otherwise express your feelings.

RELAX. First of all, you should understand, that a critical person is probably a very insecure one. Criticism comes in handy when one is in need to undermine the other in order to boost self confidence. Some people do it unconsciously even, some don't. One way or the other you shouldn't be bothered by it. Instead, you should feel like you had been given a compliment, because you are somehow bothering that person and it is probably because he\she sees something good about you, that makes him\her feel threatened. 2.

Listen for the time signature. It's impossible to determine with absolute certainty what the time signature of a song is just by listening to it. This is because a song can have the same sounds written different ways. But you can find what the most likely time signature is, which will work fine for the purpose of counting rhythms. * First listen for the pulse of the song. Tap your foot or hand along with the song until you find what feels like the beat. This beat is what you will count as quarter notes. * Then try to recognize a repeating pattern in the song, such as a chord progression or a drum beat. These are the measures of the song. * Then count how many beats are in each measure. That will give you your time signature. For example, if you hear seven beats in every repeat of the chord progression you've got a time signature of 7/4. 2. Decide what instrument to follow. You can only realistically count the rhythm of one instrument at a time. If you're going to count the drums, you'll have to listen to all the different parts of the drums when you're counting.	For most other instruments, you'll just count each note that's played.

Make a list of required hardware interfaces Start with the basics. Prepare a block diagram of your project. By utilizing the general hardware block diagram, make a list of all the external interfaces that will be supported by the micro controller. There are two general types of interfaces that should be listed. The first type of interface are the communication interface. These are peripherals, for example, USB, I2C, SPI, UART, and so on. make a special note about whether the application requires USB or some sort of Ethernet. These interfaces greatly affect how much program space the micro controller will need to support. The second type of interface is digital inputs and outputs, analog to digital inputs, PWM’s, etc. These two interface types will dictate the quantity of pins that will be needed by the micro controller. 2. Examine the software architecture.The software architecture and requirements can greatly influence the determination of a micro controller. How heavy or how light the requirements will determine weather you need a 80 MHz DSP or an 8 MHz 8051. Also make a list of other requirements for instance, is there any high frequency control loops or sensors? or other mathematical notes. Gauge to what extent and how regularly every task will need to run. Get an order of magnitude feel for how much processing power will be needed. The measurement of the required force needed will be one of the greatest necessities for the design and frequency of the micro controller. 3. Select the architecture. With the help of the information obtained by the step 1 and 2, you now got an idea about what exactly is your requirement, weather you need 8 bits , 16bits or 32 bit ARM core.	Your requirement may be of 8 bit micro controller now but you can also user a 16 bit micro controller for more features or even for the ease of use. other way round, you may select a 16 bit part now but later you may find 32 bit ARM part works better. This step is simply for giving an engineer the right direction as experimenting will make you better.

Select the architecture.With the help of the information obtained by the step 1 and 2, you now got an idea about what exactly is your requirement, weather you need 8 bits , 16bits or 32 bit ARM core. But do not forget to keep the future requirements in mind. Your requirement may be of 8 bit micro controller now but you can also user a 16 bit micro controller for more features or even for the ease of use. other way round, you may select a 16 bit part now but later you may find 32 bit ARM part works better. This step is simply for giving an engineer the right direction as experimenting will make you better. 4. Identify Memory Needs.Flash and RAM are two very critical components of any micro controllers. Make sure how much memory do you need otherwise you will run out of program space or variable space. Using the software architecture and the communication peripherals included in the application, you can estimate how much flash and RAM will be required for the application. you can always start with more and then later move to a more constrained part within the same chip family. 5. Start searching for micro controllers. You can start with looking for a micro controller once you have jot down all the aspects of your requirement. Talk with the Field Application Engineer about your application and requirements so that they can also direct you to a new part that meets your requirement.The next best place to start is with a silicon provider that you are already familiar with.Most silicon providers have a search engine that allows you to enter your peripheral sets, I/O and power requirements and it will narrow down the list of parts that match the criteria. From that list the you can move forward towards selecting a micro controller. 6. Examine Costs and Power Constraints. At this point you will come across many potential candidates to select from.	If it is highly specialized or a high-end processing machine then price might be critical. Don’t forget about this key element. And if the part doesn't meet your requirement the keep scrolling through the list till you have got the one you looking for.
Choose_a_Micro_Controller.txt	Begin_Revision	0.936	## Steps	126	So it is important to make sure that all the necessary tools are available for the part because without the right tools , the development process could become tedious and expensive .	## Section::::Steps.	158	Therefore , it is important to make sure that all the necessary tools are available for the part because without the right tools , the development process could become tedious and expensive .	<insert><Therefore><1>|||<replace><So><1><,><2>	True	Steps  1. Make a list of required hardware interfaces Start with the basics. Prepare a block diagram of your project. By utilizing the general hardware block diagram, make a list of all the external interfaces that will be supported by the micro controller. There are two general types of interfaces that should be listed. The first type of interface are the communication interface. These are peripherals, for example, USB, I2C, SPI, UART, and so on. make a special note about whether the application requires USB or some sort of Ethernet. These interfaces greatly affect how much program space the micro controller will need to support. The second type of interface is digital inputs and outputs, analog to digital inputs, PWM’s, etc. These two interface types will dictate the quantity of pins that will be needed by the micro controller. 2. Examine the software architecture.The software architecture and requirements can greatly influence the determination of a micro controller. How heavy or how light the requirements will determine weather you need a 80 MHz DSP or an 8 MHz 8051. Also make a list of other requirements for instance, is there any high frequency control loops or sensors? or other mathematical notes. Gauge to what extent and how regularly every task will need to run. Get an order of magnitude feel for how much processing power will be needed. The measurement of the required force needed will be one of the greatest necessities for the design and frequency of the micro controller. 3. Select the architecture.With the help of the information obtained by the step 1 and 2, you now got an idea about what exactly is your requirement, weather you need 8 bits , 16bits or 32 bit ARM core. But do not forget to keep the future requirements in mind. Your requirement may be of 8 bit micro controller now but you can also user a 16 bit micro controller for more features or even for the ease of use. other way round, you may select a 16 bit part now but later you may find 32 bit ARM part works better. This step is simply for giving an engineer the right direction as experimenting will make you better. 4. Identify Memory Needs.Flash and RAM are two very critical components of any micro controllers. Make sure how much memory do you need otherwise you will run out of program space or variable space. Using the software architecture and the communication peripherals included in the application, you can estimate how much flash and RAM will be required for the application. you can always start with more and then later move to a more constrained part within the same chip family. 5. Start searching for micro controllers. You can start with looking for a micro controller once you have jot down all the aspects of your requirement. Talk with the Field Application Engineer about your application and requirements so that they can also direct you to a new part that meets your requirement.The next best place to start is with a silicon provider that you are already familiar with.Most silicon providers have a search engine that allows you to enter your peripheral sets, I/O and power requirements and it will narrow down the list of parts that match the criteria. From that list the you can move forward towards selecting a micro controller. 6. Examine Costs and Power Constraints.At this point you will come across many potential candidates to select from. So this is the best time to examine the power requirements and cost of the part. If it is highly specialized or a high-end processing machine then price might be critical. Don’t forget about this key element. And if the part doesn't meet your requirement the keep scrolling through the list till you have got the one you looking for. 7. Check part availability .Once the required part is selected, next comes the step of checking the availability of that part. Some of the things to keep in mind are what the lead times for the part? Are they kept in stock at multiple distributors or is there 6 – 12 week lead time? What are your requirements for availability? You don’t want to get stuck with a large order and have to wait three months to be able to fill it. Then there is a question of how new the part is and whether it will be around for the duration of your product life cycle. If your product will be around for 10 years then you need to find a part that the manufacturer guarantees will still be built in 10 years. 8. Select a development kit.One of the best parts of selecting a new micro controller is finding a development kit to play with and learn the inner working of the controller. Once you have selected the required part then you should surely research about what development kits are available. If a development kit isn’t available then the selected part is most likely not a good choice and you should go back a few steps and find a better part.Another part may be a better choice. 9. Investigate compilers and tools. The selection of the development kit nearly solidifies the choice of micro controller. The last thing that need your attentions is to examine the comelier and tools that are available. Most micro controllers have a number of choices for compilers, example code and debugging tools.	.

Spot the behavior when it's happening. Knowing the different “faces” of passive-aggression can help you figure out your mom’s behavior and respond accordingly. Most experts agree on a few common ways passive-aggression rears its head: * Giving the silent treatment * Procrastinating and sabotaging things by failing to do tasks or reminding you about something at the last minute * Being overly critical or offering masked insults (i.e. a compliment that isn't actually sincere or that precedes a snide comment) * Behaving in a sulky manner; refusing to smile even in a cheerful environment 2. Remain calm. When dealing with a passive-aggressive, use logic. Never react emotionally. If you show that you are upset or frustrated, your mom might withdraw even further or even add to the existing tension. * If you must, take a few minutes away from her to clear your head. Call a friend, walk around the block, or play with your pet. Return in a calm headspace, so you can figure out the best way to move forward. 3. Ignore the behavior if it's not bothering you. If your mom fails to get attention for her passive-aggression, she may stop. Try acting indifferent about it and see if it changes. * For example, she offers an insincere compliment like, “That sweater is nice, but the one I bought for you is so much nicer.” Coolly respond with “thanks"" and keep doing what you were doing. * Ignoring probably won't be effective if you are really bothered by the behavior, like in terms of sabotage or a protracted silent treatment. 4. Use “I"" statements to assertively explain how the behavior affects you. Confront your mother when she's being passive, not aggressive."	.

Treat your elbows at bath time. Elbows are usually neglected in the shower which allows dirt particles to build up and create dark and rough patches. Use mild soap, warm water, and circular scrubbing motions to remove dirt build-up. * Also, it is recommended to lube up your elbows before a steamy shower to help the lubricant penetrate deeper into dry areas. * Be sure to rub in moisturizer within a few minutes after toweling dry. This helps to stop the natural evaporation of moisture. 2. Exfoliate. Exfoliation is scrubbing off dead skin cells to reveal the new and improved skin cells underneath. You can use various creams and scrubbers, in or out of the shower, to slush away skin build up. * Exfoliation should only be completed 1-2 times weekly to avoid breakouts. * You can use a scrubbing brush, pumice stone, or exfoliating cream to remove dead skin. * Choose products which contain lactic acid which will assist in reducing keratin buildup, which is a protein that can cause blockage of healthy skin pores. 3. Try a bath over a shower. Try soaking in a warm bath for half an hour to soften skin on the elbows. Prolonged exposure to warm water will soften skin. * Follow all other suggestions: use a moisturizer, wash with mild soap, and use an exfoliating body scrub or scrubber to remove dead skin. * Avoid using bubbles or bath products which contain sodium laureth sulphate which can exacerbate dry skin. * Nightly baths can also make skin drier, especially during the winter months.	.

Set up the rate as a ratio or fraction. The fraction will have feet in the numerator and seconds in the denominator. The number of second per feet should be given to you. The rate should be per second, so you should have a 1 in the denominator. * For example if you are converting 500 feet per second to miles per hour, your ratio will look like this:formula_1. 2. Convert the number of feet to miles. There are 5,280 feet in a mile.. So, to convert, divide the number of feet by 5,280. Rewrite your ratio in terms of miles per second. * For example, if you are converting 500 feet per second, you would calculate formula_2. So, your new ratio is formula_3. 3. Convert the number of seconds to hours. There are 3,600 seconds in 1 hour. So, to convert, divide the number of seconds by 3,600. Since you are working with a unit rate of 1 second, you would simply divide 1 by 3,600. Rewrite your new ratio in terms of miles per hours * For example, formula_4.	.

Record on a list EVERYTHING you've been eating during a week. I'm pretty sure you'd have eaten junkfood at least twice. Here are the evil junkfoods that caused your foldy stomach, or rounded face, or flabby arms, or wobbly thighs, or humongous butt, or meaty hips, or your all round fatness. 2. CHOCOLATE- the 1 sugar temptation. It's probably the hardest candy to avoid. It gives you a dose of dreamy happiness, and after you finish one, nothing is more tempting than another 5 seconds of sugary happiness. Well just to let you know, all digested chocolate goes straight to your butt. Sure its nice to eat but what happens once it gets dissolved in your stomach and passed down your intestines? I'll tell you. The cocoa fat in the chocolate is broken down and turned into celloluse. Celloluse is the groce layer of yellow jelly-fat, which sits on your bum, causing the wobbliness and the butt bulkiness. EEW, chocolate isn't so nice in this form is it? SO ditch the chocolate. 3. POTATO CRISPS (CHIPS)- You could call it the 1 salt temptation. YUMMY chips, a great way to kill time, occupy your hands and mouth while watching TV, and gain salt satisfaction. Chips make you fat EVERYWHERE. Chips are fried in huge vats of oil, perhaps saturated oil (except for Kettle who bake their chips) then showered with salt or animal flavouring. And what is the benifit of eating chips really? All it does is waste time, make you fat, and make you thirsty. 4. SOFT_ DRINK (FIZZY)- The best drink for a hot day, party, family occasion, holiday, or any tiny celebration. The ingredients are simple; water, flavour, food colouring, preservatives and sugar. Alot of sugar. Cups and cups of it. Do not be tricked into thinking that fruit softdrinks contain alot of healthy fruit. You see the fanta cans - 5% fruit. What? What does the other 95% contain? A majority of sugar man, sugar. 5. CONFECTIONERY- LOLLIES AND SWEETS - a perfect way to please little kids' boredom, fill you in before meals, and to make an easy, cookless, snack. Lollies make you fat in the face. URGH!. They are basically made from hardened crystallised sugar, along with food colour and flavouring, and a mixture of rubbish chemicals which give it a rubbery chewy texture and shape. Same goes for sweets, toffees, caramels, and lollipops. What a waste of time eating it! What a sacrifice to make as well, for your teeth get eaten up by the lollies' acids and sugars. 6. CAKES AND MUFFINS- You can't avoid eating cakes for birthdays, anniversaries and other various celebrations.	Cakes are made from almost every single fat causing ingredient in our diets. Full cream milk, a load of full fat butter, of course at least 2 cups of sugar, sometimes jam and cream filling, eggs, and worse still if it has chocolate flavouring or icing and cream. Pur-lease where do you think all those tummy rolls are coming from? It's converted cake cream-filling and butter galore. Oh and donuts and fudge and brownies are just disguised names for cake. Don't allow tummy bulge, you've seen what happened to Homer Simspon.

Make sure somebody is around watching them, and that there are no loud noises around that may scare them. Someone can hold your guinea pig, if you want. 2. Take out all of their toys, also including their bowl, water bottle, and hiding place. Empty the water bottle and food bowl. Take them to a sink and rinse off their hiding place if it can get wet. Then, run some hot water and submerge the water bottle and food bowl. Leave them there to dry while you clean out the cage. 3. Take your cage to where you plan to clean it and get a large garbage bag. Carefully brush everything into the bag. For really big cages, it is handy to have a cat pooper scooper to scrape out the cage. Do not use the same one as your cat, dog or other pet. 4. Spray the inside of the cage down with a 50/50 mixture of distilled white vinegar and water to clean it. This works better and is safer for your guinea pig than any other cleaning agent. If you don't, it just gets nastier each time! For deeper stains and messes, use undiluted vinegar, but make sure to clean off well afterwards! Dry it with a towel or ,if you have the time, you can let it air dry.	It is a safe deodorizer, you can buy it at any local Pet Store where the sell Guinea Pigs, Ferrets, Hamsters or Rabbits.

Obtain a long, skinny stick. The stick should be about two to three feet long, and no wider than an inch or so in diameter. If you cannot find a stick with these dimensions, you could whittle a wider, longer one down to the appropriate size. 2. Obtain some dental floss and form a slipknot. The dental floss should be about ten inches long, with seven inches on the loop side and three to four inches hanging down from the end of the stick. Tie a slipknot with the dental floss. * To tie a slipknot, bring one end of the dental floss about two thirds of the way down towards the other end of the dental floss. The dental floss should resemble a “C.” * Holding the curved side of the loop in your left hand and the two ends of the “C” in your other, twist your left hand to form a loop. Pass your left hand through the loop and pull the bottom arm of it back through. Do not bring the entire arm of the floss through the loop. Leave the tip of the floss just outside it. 3. Catch the lizard in the loop. Tie the long end of the loop to the end of your stick. The loop should hang about four to six inches down from the end of your stick. Approach the lizard you want to catch slowly and cautiously. Hang the loop slightly in front of it and either wait for it to enter the loop or gently ease the loop around the lizard’s neck. Either way, when its neck is within the loop, pull up gently to tighten the slipknot and catch the lizard. 4. Remove the noose as quickly as possible. There is little chance of hurting or choking the lizard with the slipknot when it is only stuck within it for a short while.	Remove the slipknot as soon as possible.

Gather all of the items listed in the ""Things You'll Need"" section at the bottom of this page. If there's anything you don't have, you'll need to buy it as these are essentials. 2. Practice good hygiene. Make sure that you brush your teeth at least twice a day. Wash your hair often, or it will be gross and oily. Over washing hair can cause it to be oily as well. 3. Pamper your skin. Once a week apply a face mask. If you can't afford one, there's no need to skip this step. Half of a mashed up banana with some tea tree oil is great for a budget-savers. Apply hand cream whenever possible and scure is beautiful and goes with anything. If you can get to the salon, they do it best If not, have someone else do your nails. Don't do your own as they never turn out nicely. Keep your nails painted and nicely filed all the time. Paint your toenails in a hot color such as pink or blue. 4. Get a haircut. This is your first real step to a more noticeably beautiful you. Make sure your haircut is something that you're comfortable with, but do something new. Highlights, layers, beveled ends, shorter styles or side bangs are really beautiful. Contrary to popular belief, one length is NOT drab; but it certainly does not look good on everyone. Some people can pull it off and some people can't. Make sure your hairstyle will be admired, not made fun of. Don't be afraid! Before you go to the salon, spend some time looking through magazines and figure out what you like. If possible, it's best to bring the hairstylist a picture so you are close to a guarantee to get it the way you like it. Don't do something you're really uncomfortable with, but try to get a cool hairstyle. 5. Keep your new hairstyle looking great. Now that you've got a beautiful haircut, show it off! Make sure you do your hair every morning. Straighten it or, if it suits your hairstyle better, curl it. If you shower in the morning, use a tad bit of product and let your hair go natural! Natural looking hair will keep your look pretty and soft, even more approachable in some ways. Headbands are in right now, and black,brown, or white headbands will go with almost any outfit. There are tons of wire and jewelry-like headbands available as well. In a rush? Put it up. This can be beautiful, too. Ponytails and messy buns are great, braids are back in style. 6. Try new makeup. Makeup is not a must, but you may want to use it. Eyeliner is a great investment if you want to fill your eyes out and make them look for defined or bigger. Use a white pencil liner around the inner corners and center of your eye lids to make your eyes pop. If you don't want to wear make up, or your parents don't want you to, don't worry about it. Get an eyelash curler if you can. Curling your eyelashes is a great alternative to mascara, curling opens your eyes up and makes them appear brighter - but be careful or you can damage your lashes! A little bit of lip gloss over a color or on its own will fill out your lips. Unless you're absolutely not allowed to, you should keep a little concealer, too, to cover up major blemishes. If you absolutely can't wear makeup, make sure you take really good care of your skin. This way, you won't have as many blemishes. Keep your makeup in a cute carrying case and keep and essentials with you all the time - in your school bag or in your purse, depending on where you're going. 7. Shake up your wardrobe. Even cheap clothes can be great clothes. If you have a bigger budget, get some new clothes from more popular branded stores, if not, thrift store looking outfits are very popular right now. Make sure you've got a couple of well-fitted, cool pairs of jeans. Tank tops and fitted tees can make a huge difference."	Get a couple of tank tops, plain or a bunch of tanks lined with lace would be good, too. Wear these underneath tee shirts that aren't that cool, so that they show at the bottom. Try layering a couple. Then, get one cool brand-name hoodie (or two if you can afford it) to layer over top. You don't need new clothes to change your look, just try and wear them differently.

Compare_Keirsey_and_Myers_Briggs_Personality_Typology.txt	Begin_Revision	0.935	## Steps	120	So , for each temperament , there are four MBTI personalities that fit into that temperament .	## Steps	161	Thus , for each temperament , there are four MBTI personalities that fit into that temperament .	<replace><So><1><Thus><1>	True	Steps  1. Firstly, try to understand the Myers Briggs Typology. The best way to this is to test yourself. A link is provided below. The results of this test will give you four initials which describe your personality. Look up these initials of the Personality Page Portraits to find a very accurate description of the way you tend to behave. Alternatively, if you are looking to understand someone else you know you can either ask them to take the Myers Briggs Test or guess their personality dimensions using the Personality Pathways website linked below. 2. There are sixteen different MBTI personalities. The dimensions are Introversion (I) Vs Extraversion (E), Sensing (S) Vs Intuition (I), Feeling (F) Vs Thinking (T) and Perceiving (P) Vs Judging (J). Most people have a tendency to act in favour of one of the dimensions rather than the other. For example, if a person has a tendency to prefer spending time by themselves or socialising one on one as opposed to socialising in a group of people, they are likely to be introverted rather than extroverted. Therefore the first initial of the personality would be marked by (I). However, this does not mean than the person is always introverted and is not capable of being sociable in a big group. A useful way to think of the MBTI dichotomies is that most people have a dominant hand they prefer using, but that doesn’t mean a right- handed person can’t use their left hand at all! 3. In the 1970’s, Kiersey categorised the 16 MBTI personalities into four temperaments: the “guardians” who security seek (SJ), the “artisans” who sensation seek (SP), the “rationals” who knowledge seek (NT) and the “idealists” who identity seek (NF).	For example, an individual with an MBTI of “ISFJ” would have an “guardian” temperament because they have a preference of “Sensing” and “Judging.”

Fix_a_Leaky_Shower_Faucet.txt	Begin_Revision	0.919	### Installing a New Cartridge	2333	Then , turn off the shower and make sure the leak is gone .	### Installing a New Cartridge in a Single-Handle Shower	2440	Finally , turn off the shower and make sure the leak is gone .	<replace><Then><1><Finally><1>	True	Installing a New Cartridge  1. Turn off your water valve before beginning. Your water valve controls the flow of water to your shower. It may be located in your bathroom or your basement. In some cases, you'll find it behind a panel near your shower. Once you locate the valve, turn the knob clockwise to turn off the water. * You may find the panel that gives you access to your water valve in the room next to your bathroom. It may even be in a closet. 2. Remove your shower handle using a screwdriver. The screw will be in the center of a knob handle or on the side of a curved handle. Choose a screwdriver that fits into the screwhead. Then, carefully turn the screwdriver counter-clockwise to loosen it. Pull out the screw and set it aside to reuse when you replace the shower handle. * Your handle could have more than 1 screw, so make sure you remove all of them. * If your handle won’t come off, try heating it with a hair dryer. Set the heat to high, then blow the hot air onto your handle for 1 minute. Drape a towel over the handle to protect your hand from the heat. Then, try to pull off the handle. 3. Use your screwdriver to remove the faceplate. The faceplate is the metal piece that's behind your handle. Fit the screwdriver tip into the screws on the faceplate. Turn counter-clockwise to loosen the screws. Set the screws aside for later, then carefully pull off the faceplate and set it aside. * The faceplate may stick to the tile or shower wall. If this happens, gently wiggle it until it comes free. 4. Pull the metal sleeve off of the shower valve that’s behind the faceplate. Look at your shower valve. You should see a metal sleeve that covers the end of your valve. Use your hands to carefully remove this sleeve, then set it aside for later. * This sleeve is called an escutcheon. If you look for one at the hardware store, this is what you’ll need to ask for. 5. Use pliers to remove the locking clip if your valve has one. Look for the locking clip on the top of your valve, where the end should stick out. It will look like a metal rod with a raised top. If you see one, use a pair of needle-nose pliers to carefully pull it out. Set it to the side so you can replace it when you’re finished. * The locking clip should be visible on the top of the valve. They aren’t present on all valves, so don’t worry if you don’t see one. * You may need to use a screwdriver or awl to pry up the clip. 6. Fit a deep well socket wrench over the valve cartridge. A deep well socket wrench is a wrench that has a long metal tube fitted onto the end so you can remove nuts or screws that are embedded inside a hole. Choose a deep well socket wrench that’s the right size for your cartridge, then slide it over the cartridge inside the valve. Turn it counter-clockwise to make sure it grips the cartridge. If it’s too loose, choose the next size down. * If you don’t have a deep well socket wrench, you can pick one up at your local hardware store or online. Most deep well socket wrenches come with a range of sockets in different sizes so you can find the 1 that fits your nut. * You can also find tools that are called “cartridge pullers.” These will also remove your cartridge. However, make sure you get the cartridge puller made for your brand of faucet. 7. Turn the wrench counterclockwise to remove the cartridge. Use the handle to slowly turn the wrench, which will loosen the cartridge. Keep turning until the cartridge feels like it’s free. * The cartridge may come out in the deep well socket wrench. However, it’s normal for it to remain in the wall. 8. Use your needle-nose pliers to pull out the cartridge. The cartridge looks like a long cylinder with a metal rod sticking out of the top. Latch onto the end of the cartridge using your needle-nose pliers. Then, carefully pull the cartridge from inside the valve. * If you don’t have your replacement cartridge yet, take the old cartridge to your local hardware store to find a match. For an easy option, show it to an experienced store associate and let them find the match for you. * The cartridge is the part of the valve that controls the flow and temperature of the water. 9. Install a new cartridge into the valve by turning it clockwise. Slide the new cartridge into the empty valve. Then, put your deep well socket wrench over the cartridge and turn it clockwise. Stop when the cartridge feels like it’s tight. 10. Replace your valve sleeve, faceplate, and shower handle. Slide the valve sleeve (escutcheon) back over the valve, then put the faceplate back into place. Use your screwdriver to secure the faceplate against the shower wall. Finally, screw your shower handle back into place. * If your valve had a locking clip, don’t forget to put it back on before you replace the valve sleeve. 11. Turn your water valve back on and test your shower. Return to your water valve and turn the knob counter-clockwise so the water will come back on. Once your water is back on, turn on the shower to see if it works correctly.	.
Fix_a_Leaky_Shower_Faucet.txt	Begin_Revision	0.919	### Replacing Washers	2356	Then , turn off the faucet and check that the leak is fixed .	### Replacing Washers in a 2-Handle Shower	2463	Finally , turn off the faucet and check that the leak is fixed .	<replace><Then><1><Finally><1>	True	Replacing Washers  1. Switch off the water valve before you get started. The water valve controls the flow of water to your shower faucet, and it’s often located in your bathroom or basement. You may find it behind a panel that’s located on the other side of your shower. Turn the knob on your shower valve clockwise to shut off the water. * If you’re having trouble finding your shower valve, look in the bedroom next to your shower. You may find the panel there. 2. Feel the water coming from the faucet to see if it’s hot or cold. Put your hand under the leak to check the temperature of the water. If it’s cold, then it’s likely the cold side that’s leaking. On the other hand, hot water means the hot side is likely leaking. * It’s possible that both sides are leaking. If this is the case, you can replace the washer on the second side if the leak remains after you replace the first washer. 3. Use a screwdriver to remove the shower handle on the leaky side. Look for the screw in the center of the shower handle. Fit your screwdriver into the screw that holds the shower handle in place. Turn your screwdriver counter-clockwise to loose the screw and remove it. Set the screw and the handle aside for later. 4. Remove the metal plate that attaches to the shower wall. This is the plate that goes between the handle and the shower wall. Look inside the plate to see if it has threads, which it likely will. Gently unscrew the metal plate by turning it counter-clockwise. When it comes off, set it aside until you’re ready to put it back on. * This piece has a metal plate that sits against your wall and a short metal tube that your shower handle attaches to. * This is also called an escutcheon. 5. Slide a deep well socket wrench over the metal stem and onto the nut. A deep well socket wrench is a wrench with a long metal tube on the end. It allows you to reach nuts that are embedded inside a structure. The nut will be located deep inside your wall, but a deep well socket wrench can reach it. Choose the size that looks right, then slide it over the metal stem. Secure the end of the wrench over the valve nut that’s at the base of the metal stem. * You can find a deep well socket wrench at a local hardware store or online. They're often sold in sets so you can choose the right size socket for your needs. * To make sure it’s the right size, turn the wrench counter-clockwise to make sure it’s gripping the nut. 6. Unscrew the valve nut and set it aside. Turn the wrench counter-clockwise until the nut comes free. Then, remove the wrench and the nut from the valve. Set the nut aside so you can put it back on later. * Your nut should stick in the wrench when you pull it out. 7. Pull the metal stem out of the wall and put it aside. The metal stem is the part of your faucet that the handle turns. Use your fingers to carefully remove the metal stem. It should slide out easily now that the nut isn’t holding it in place. Set the metal stem to the side so you can reuse it. 8. Remove the old rubber washer and install a new rubber washer. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to pull the old rubber o-ring washer from around the valve. It should easily come off because it’s just pressed onto the valve. Discard the old washer, then press a new rubber o-ring washer over the valve. Line it up in the exact place as the old one. * Make sure your replacement rubber washer is the same size as the 1 that's already there. This will ensure a proper fit. * Coat the new washer in heat-proof faucet grease to improve the seal. 9. Replace your metal stem, faceplate, and shower handle. Slide the metal stem back into place. Then, put the nut into your deep well socket wrench. Slide the wrench over the metal stem and replace the nut by turning it clockwise. Next, put the faceplate against the wall and turn it to secure it in place. Finally, screw the shower handle back onto the metal stem. 10. Turn on your water valve and test the faucet. Go back to the water valve and turn the knob counter-clockwise to make the water come back on. Next, turn on your shower faucet. Make sure that the water is running correctly.	.
Design_a_Functioning_Arts_and_Crafts_Studio.txt	Begin_Revision	0.959	### Putting Your Studio Together	609	Rather it has doilies ( wheels ) or one of those tables that fold up or let the user change the dimensions of the table .	### Putting Your Studio Together	699	Whether it has doilies ( wheels ) or one of those tables that fold up or let the user change the dimensions of the table .	<replace><Rather><1><Whether><1>	True	"Putting Your Studio Together  1. Get the proper equipment for the crafts activity your doing. This is not just the paints and brushes.But also the canvas,easel, paint thinner, palette and drop clothes. A crafts person will also need more than one kind of glue for different and first aid kits in case something goes wrong. 2. Determine the correct size of a workstation. The workstation is the place where you'll be using your creative skills and doing other things. A painter needs a table that will provide enough room to paint a picture without risk of spilling red paint into a jar of white paint, bumping into the wall or tipping over the water while doing strokes on the canvas, to fit the canvas without it tilting and dripping paint into on wanted area or bumping his paint messy hand onto the art book or tablet computer. Artists tend to work more confidently on a spacious workstation table. * Get a workstation that's the correct height and width. You don't want to be crammed into a corner without ample room to stretch and move about nor should you have to stretch out of shape to reach supplies. Don't forget to have comfortable seating. 3. Tailor your studio to your specific crafts. Do research and get ideas from actual artist by researching online, reading art books or simply watching specials on TV. The tips and methods in this article are only a jumping off point and art is an individual thing. Different kinds of craft also require different tools, lighting, equipment and settings. 4. Keep the walls colorless if possible. It's best to pick a nice clean white with no other colors in. * Picking any other color will cause trouble. Dark colors will absorb lights and make the room darker which is not appropriate for most crafts. Picking any other color besides white will reflect that particular color unto the project doing and your project will turn out different colors in a different room or outside. You can always decorate the other parts of the room with your favorite colors keeping the white dominant. 5. Find the correct lighting. Excellent lighting is the fundamental of a well designed art studio. * Too much can be just as bad as too much. Poor lighting makes it difficult to do fine details in the work like adding the find strands of hair to an oil painting or stitching on glass beads to a lace linen. Too much lighting causes glare(reflections off shiny items) and make colors look faded. Both scenarios will cause eye problems and eyestrain. * Choose your light color correctly. Light colors like paint will affect the tones and hues of your projects and materials. Not all light bulbs and colors are created equal. ""Warm white"" with yellow in it like candlelight or traditional lights can fade colors and make them look duller. ""Cool white"" with blue in it is said to be the artist light because electric companies claim it enhances the colors of the materials.This white color is also called daylight. There is also one called ""pure white"" which has no colors in it and it's the same color as bright white typing paper. The best option in light is a cool white or a good quality pure white. * Consider cool LED bulbs for detail up close lighting. Incandescent, Fluorescent or Halogen lighting can get extremely hot and make it uncomfortable to work around. LED also perhaps won't hurt most materials sensitive to light. * Natural light may or may not be good. The tones of light the sun gives to a room not only varies by the time of day but by many factors. Morning light has more blue in it than Dusk or Sunset light. The storm clouds and also pollution can color the sun an infinite array of colors.Also the colors of things around the window can influence colors in the room. 6. Look into storage options. * Keep materials organized in appropriate containers. Categorize your materials by brand, type, material or by project. There many specific containers for specific materials. Some storage containers also have locks to keep unwanted guests or curious pets and kids out of potentially dangerous materials. * Don't just dump materials in a huge box or plastic bin. It's practically creating a pile of mess in a box that one has to dig about like a pirate searching for treasure. Don't also put loads of different tiny boxes in one huge container.It's much better to keep lots of smaller boxes on shelves. Save the big bin for larger items.This also will save on straining the muscles and hands. * Don't put heavy items on high shelves. Heavy items should be placed on lower shelves and at shorter distances from your workstation. 7. Keep the design of the room flexible in case of changes. * Consider having a portable form of a workstation or table."	.

Create a fireproof barrier. One way to protect your home from fire is to create a border around your house that is essentially fireproof. Gravel and concrete on the ground help create a break line, such as driveways and patios. You can also use small, fire-retardant plants that grow close to the ground. * Focus your efforts on any area that moves uphill towards your house, as that's where fire is most likely to strike. * Try to make a break of 100 feet around your home. You don't need to only have concrete in that area, but any plants should be spaced out. * Clear around other structures, too, such as sheds. It can help to just clean out the undergrowth. 2.

Take time to rest and relax between activities. Plan to sit down in the shade and relax for at least half an hour 2-3 times per day. This will help keep your energy up and can prevent exhaustion. At multi-day festivals, make time to visit your tent and take a nap around mid-day so you can stay up later to enjoy nighttime activities. * If you begin to feel weak or exhausted at any point, make your way to the medical tent to get assistance. There, you’ll be able to sit or lay down and can rehydrate in the shade. 2. Drink at least of water each day of the festival. Hydration is extremely important if you’re spending the day outside. Carry a water bottle around with you at all times so you can drink from it as needed. If you’re having alcohol, have a cup of water in between each drink to avoid becoming dehydrated. * Even if the weather isn’t extremely hot outside, it’s important to stay hydrated, since you’ll be moving around during the shows and events. 3. Wear a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen to protect your skin and keep cool. No matter what the weather, the sun can cause damage to your skin if you’re outside for long periods of time. Bring along a hat or visor and wear sunglasses during the day. Before you go outside for events, put on sunscreen and re-apply it every 3-4 hours throughout the day. * If you’re in a location where it’s very sunny, re-apply your sunscreen every 2 hours to ensure that it’s protecting your skin. 4. Keep your phone on you at all times in case there’s an emergency. Festivals tend to have a lot of people in one area at the same time. If something goes wrong, have your phone ready to call for help. Be sure to save the phone number of the security tent in case you need assistance. * This is also a great way to keep in contact with your friends to make plans and update them with your location. 5. Use the buddy system if you’re going to an event.	Stick with the person who you went to the event with, and spend the day doing things both of you want to do.

Decide early. Medical school is a vast and fascinating world. During the initial years, many students may not have the idea on whether, where, and in which branch to do a post graduation, but try to develop your goals as early as possible. The best time will be by the first year and the eleventh hour would be by the internship /house-surgency period. 2. Contact your seniors. Try to find out who else among your seniors have gone for the same, try to contact them. Find out if the option is feasible for you, taking your personal side into consideration. This would include finance, family relations, etc. 3. Understand the qualifying process. This is the most difficult part for international students. This article is mainly for these details which are not properly explained elsewhere. The qualifying exams are called USMLE - United States Medical Licensing Examinations. There are four exams in total - Step 1, step2 ck, step 2 cs and step 3. The first two can be written in all countries, but the last two can only be written in US. 4. For writing the exams, you have to register with the ECFMG - Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. This organization helps with the initial application and details. The various pdf links in their beautiful site gives all necessary information regarding the paper works to be done. This is one site to depend upon for all your doubts on the entire process. 5. Step 1 - This exam is centered around the subjects learned during the first three years of medical school. IE anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, and pathology. In addition, there are three more subjects to the list - epidemiology, psychiatry, and ethics. The best time to write the exam would be after your third year. 6. USE - Us clinical experience - This is perhaps the most important criteria for getting a seat in residency. For international students, the clinical practices in Us will be a little bit different from what has already been seen. Hence for you to be seriously considered for residency, it is always important that you have had some sort of clinical experience in US. This includes electives, internship, observer ship, research, or volunteering. The benefit of each is in the same order with electives being your best option. Elective - doing part of your internship in US. This is possible and a lot of international students do apply and do electives in US medical schools every year. Internship - this is for people who have already graduated from medical school. You can follow a doctor working in US and can involve yourself in clinics. Observer ship - you can follow and observe a doctor in the US but you cannot deal directly with the patients. In addition, you can be part of any research experience or be a volunteer at any free clinics. The longer you have any USE, the better your chances are. The duration is more important than the type of USE. 7. step 2 ck - ck stands for clinical knowledge. This exam is based on topics learned in the final year - medicine, surgery, Obgyn, pediatrics, epidemiology, and ethics. 8. step 2 cs - cs stands for clinical skills. This exam tests your practical skills, communication, and bedside manners. This exam is currently given only in the US. Hence many of you will have to apply for a visiting visa to go to the US for the exam. 9. ECFMG certification - Once the above exams are passed, you will be certified by the ECFMG, and a very impressive certificate will be awarded to you for the same.	.

Find_an_Immigration_Lawyer.txt	Begin_Revision	0.946	### Choosing an Attorney	1062	But , if your particular issue is complicated or extremely rare , they may have to do some research .	### Choosing an Attorney	1141	However , if your particular issue is complicated or extremely rare , they may have to do some research .	<replace><But><1><However><1>	True	Choosing an Attorney  1. Make an appointment with each of the lawyers remaining on your list. Contact each of the attorneys remaining on your list and set up a consultation. Some lawyers charge a small fee of $50 or so for consultations. If you think this particular lawyer has the potential to serve you well, it may be worth it to pay it. However, most attorneys do offer free consultations. Do not pay a fee if you can't afford it. 2. Ask for a phone consultation if necessary. If you do not live in the same state as the attorney, you can schedule a phone consultation instead of an in-person meeting. However, because the attorney will have to appear in court where you live, try to find a local attorney to represent you. * The only reason to hire an out-of-state attorney is if you have a very complicated case and need a particular lawyer who specializes in cases similar to yours. * For example, a political refugee hoping to get asylum in the United States would need to find an attorney who specializes in asylum cases. 3. Prepare a list of questions for the meeting.You have a limited amount of time with each lawyer, so make each question count. Remember that you are interviewing the attorney for a job, and treat your meeting as such: a job interview. Some questions you should ask include: * How long the attorney has been practicing immigration law (look for someone with at least 3-5 years experience) * How many immigration cases the attorney handles per year (you want to hire someone who spends at least 50% of his or her time doing immigration work) * Whether the immigration attorney knows the immigration judges in your area. 4. Gather all the information and documents you were asked to bring. If any of the attorneys asked you to bring specific documents or information to the meeting, gather them ahead of time to ensure you can locate them on the day of the appointment. 5. Go to your consultations. Take notes as you speak with to each attorney so you can remember what each attorney said and what your initial impressions were. These notes will help you make a smart, informed decision. * Some attorneys may attempt to take over the conversation and steer it where they want it to go. If you are comfortable with that, it is fine, but if not, do not allow it to happen. * The attorney shouldn't have any problem answering the questions you prepared. They shouldn't sound hesitant or unsure.	.

Narrow your search to coaches with 1 or more certifications. A certified coach has a solid theoretical and practical foundation for their instruction. There are a number of certification programs that specialize in training and educating coaches. Skim a prospective coaches bio for information about the certifications they’ve earned. You can also browse each program’s website for search for certified coaches. * Look for certifications from the Aerobics and Fitness Association of America (AFAA), the American Council on Exercise (ACE), National Strength and Conditioning Academy (CSCS), the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM), and others. * Bonus points if your trainer holds an undergraduate or graduate degree in exercise science or a similar topic. Educational credentials serve as evidence of a trainer’s longstanding commitment to and deep understanding of the field. * A coach with a group training certification hasn’t been properly trained for personal training, and a trainer without any certifications should raise a red flag. Narrow your search to someone who is experienced in one-on-one fitness coaching. 2. Book complimentary consultations with the coaches you’re considering. Consultations should be free and no-strings-attached. An appointment may be a quick 20-minute conversation, or a complimentary training session. This first meeting is a great opportunity for you to discuss your fitness goals, timeline, and coaching expectations with each of the coaches on your shortlist. And, it’s a chance for you to decide whether you’d like to work with the coach. * Think of this consultation like a job interview, and don’t be afraid to discuss the fact that you’re considering a few possible trainers. * Come prepared with a series of questions for the trainer. Ask them to describe their instructional process and motivational style. * Have the coach explain where they might begin with your training program. You should be able to picture what working with them might be like. 3. Choose a coach who is an empathetic active listener. To provide you with an individualized instruction, a trainer should first listen carefully to you as you describe your goals and expectations. If you feel they’re giving you generic advice or recommendations that don’t align with your goals, move on with your search. * The coach should also pay close attention and adapt your exercises if you describe pain, discomfort, or injuries. * You know your body better than anyone else, and while a little burning and aching is to be expected, you’ll know when something doesn’t feel right. A trainer who urges you to push through this type of pain is putting you in danger. 4. Gather information about the trainer’s rates. During your consultation session, have the trainer generate a personalized quote for the types of services they could provide you with. * The average hourly rate is 28 USD. Do some comparison shopping to get a sense of your area’s average rates and see how they align with your budget. 5. Avoid a coach who prioritizes selling over serving. Of course, coaches are in the business of retaining clients. They’re also responsible for offering new products and services that will benefit their clients as well as their pocketbooks.	.

Find boys. Some girls says, ""Oh, we're never going meet any boys"". That's such a lie. Look around. There are boys everywhere! All you have to do is take some time, and get to know them. You never know, that weird guy from your math class could be the boy from your dreams! Talk to them, and find out if they're worth spending time on, and if you actually have something in common. If you don't - find someone else! But don't be one of those people that jump from person to person, that leaves the other person hanging in the dark. Be nice, say, ""Well, I'll see you around"". But to be safe, wait till the conversation is over. 2. Start talking to him about random things. Find out his interests and hobbies. You will become better friends as time goes on. Don't be too random, though. He'll think it's weird if you randomly ask if he likes carrots. 3. Get along with his friends. If his friends don't like you, he probably won't like you either (unless his friends are jealous, but don't ask them if they are). 4. Understand what guys want. We all know that most guys like girls who are feminine, have curves in the right places, and stuff like that. But what else do the guys want? Here are a few 'requests': * Nice looks. * Confidence. * A girl who is happy. * Intelligence. * A sense of humor. * Patience. * Generosity. * Sophistication. * Attitude (not the sassy kind) * A great smile 5. Make a list where you write down all the things you like about yourself. Do you have really pretty eyes? Well, then start wearing eyeliner, or just make them really stand out. Or do you have really great hair? Well, try straightening or curling it! My point is, that if you focus on the things you like about yourself, boys will notice those things too. 6. Make boys notice you. Make him trip over you, or you can trip in front of him. That will surely get his attention! If you make him trip, the first thing you've got to do is to apologize to him. And then say something like ""Hey, nice shirt."" or ""I like your shoes."" Or just quick think of a funny thing you guys could talk about. Just small talk, nothing too overwhelming. Never seem too desperate, guys really hate that. Just be confident, and smile. 7. Tell one of [guy's name]'s friends that [guy's name] looked nice today (or a similar compliment). Chances are that they will tell him. Of course, don't be so pushy that it's creepy. Make sure that it doesn't seem that you're telling everyone that you think he looks nice or whatever besides him. 8. Smile when he walks by, but casually. Give a short smile that says ""Hi, I can't talk right now, but talk to me later."" 9. Have your girlfriends do a little spying, but make sure they don't get too involved. 10. Notice his body language. If he's looking at you for a really long time, that would most likely mean that he likes you."	.
Distract_Yourself_from_Cutting.txt	Inside_Revision	0.76	## Steps	80	Then take a cold bath .	## Steps	148	or take a cold bath .	<replace><Then><1><or><1>	True	Steps  1. Be active. Exercise, meditate, do yoga, or even go for a small walk. Activities like these help clear your head and calm you down. 2. Talk to someone. You can talk about anything to a friend, or even talk about what upsets you. Ask someone to hug you as well. 3. Laugh. When you're upset, watch a funny movie, laugh with some friends, or do something else you find funny. 4. Surf the Internet. Search the web for things, or answer questions that people have on a question/answer site. You can also chat with someone. 5. Read, listen to music, doodle/draw, or make something. 6. Write. For example, write poems or start writing your own book. You can also write a burn letter (where you write down your feelings and what's bothering you, then burn what you wrote.) 7. If you hurt yourself, put a few rubber bands on your wrist, or anywhere you were hurt, and snap them whenever you feel like cutting. Rub an ice cube on the place you cut or hold it in the crook of your arm or leg. If you want to see blood, use red dye and paint lines on your skin with it, or draw where you cut with a red pen.	.

Don't go looking for fights. Do everything you can to avoid them. 2. Know your own limitations. If you can't go thirty seconds without stopping for breath start working out and getting some endurance training. You need to be able to last a good 3 minutes of solid fighting/grappling/wrestling. 3. Fight like your life depends on it. No one fights to get the other person to submit. You fight to hurt people. Do you want to get hurt or go home safely? 4. Stay on your feet. Unless you're a cage fighter and you can fight on the ground, avoid it. We will touch on this later. 5. Defend your face and body with your arms. Keep your elbows in and your fists near eye level away from your face to block side attacks. 6. Stand with your feet a little wider than shoulder width, strong foot forward and slightly to the outside, weak side to the rear and outside. 7. Slightly bend at the knees. 8. Slightly bend forward. 9. If you have exhausted all forms of negotiating and the fight is definitely going to happen, move in. Get close to your target. Don’t stand arms width apart. That’s where the punch will hurt the most. Get close. Try this for example. walk up to a wall, put your fist about 2 inches away and punch the wall. Not bad, didn’t kill you right? Now step back and punch the wall as hard as you can with a full extension of your arm. You didn’t do it, did you? It would have hurt like hell. 10. Grab/bite ears. They come off with a little bit of force. The psychological effect of having an ear ripped off will stop most fights. 11. Jab eyes. If they can't see. . .you get the point 12. Punch the throat. If you can't breath you can't fight. 13. Don't forget your knees and elbows in close quarters. They may be harder to control and have shorter reach, but they are strong, hard for an opponent to grab, and they pack a lot of force. 14. Hair is pretty much worthless unless they have lots of it. Pull it! There is also a trick you can do, using your opponent's hair. It works better if they are wearing a ponytail. Grab it and bring their face down to your knee, with much force. 15. Joints. Not the ones you smoke but the ones in your body. If you can break an extremity at the joint you can plan on a fight being over right then and there. 16. Feet. A solid foot stomp onto the top of your opponent’s foot will result in the immediate breaking of bones and you will almost certainly cause their foot to swell to the point of no return. 17. Hands. If you can grab a hand take a hold of it and flip it in a big circle and twist it 180 degrees. Once in that position you can manipulate the arm and break it easily. 18. Collar bones. Your collar bone has the strength of that flute player in the marching band. . .it's weak. About 7 pounds of pressure will snap a collar bone and the entire arm will drop like a load of potatoes. 19. Groin. It's a common misconception that groin attacks are only effective on men. On both men and women, this will cause severe pain. If that don't take your opponent down, it surely will reduce their fighting efficiency.	.

Apply liquid to the lenses. You can run the lenses under water for a minute, or you can use specialized cleaning solution designed for use with glasses. Window cleaning sprays also work well. * Do not yet apply any chemical that contains abrasive materials or has a high acid content. Glasses typically have layers or coatings over the lens itself.

Talk with your child about why they’re afraid. Understanding your child’s fear is essential for helping them work through it. Ask your child what in particular scares them about the water. Are they afraid of sinking? Does it make them uneasy to watch bathwater go down the drain? * Many children develop a fear of the water after having a bad experience, such as accidentally getting water up their nose. * Once you know where your child’s fear is coming from, you can find ways to help them cope with the particular situation that scares them. You might say, ""Sweetie, I noticed that you get really jumpy during bath-time. What bothers you about taking a bath?"" 2. Take your child’s fears seriously. Kids need empathy and support when they’re scared of something. Listen to your child and make them feel understood. Avoid brushing off their fears or telling them that they shouldn’t be afraid. * For instance, if your daughter is afraid of getting her face wet, reassure her by saying something like, “It seems like this is scary for you. Putting your face in the water feels funny, doesn’t it?” * When you validate your child’s feelings, it reassures them that they can trust you. 3. Set small goals and adjust them as your child progresses. Build your child’s confidence by setting a small goal that they can achieve easily. As they get more used to the water, set new goals that stretch their comfort zone a little bit further. *"	After they’re comfortable doing that, have them climb down steps or a ladder to practice submerging themselves more.

Ask your doctor about medications to slow the effects of IPF. Although IPF is incurable, the U.S. FDA has approved a number of prescription medications which can delay the progression of the disease and increase the lifespan of your lungs. Current FDA-approved medications include pirfenidone (Esbriet) and nintedanib (Ofev). * The FDA may approve further medications for IPF in upcoming years. 2. Undergo pulmonary rehabilitation to maintain your lung function. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a fairly standard practice for individuals with IPF, although the specific aspects of each individual’s rehabilitation regimen may vary. During rehabilitation, you’ll work with clinicians who can advise you on breathing techniques, exercise training, and strategies to conserve your energy when you’re running out of breath. * Ask your doctor to refer you to a pulmonary rehabilitation specialist. * Alternately, if you live near a clinic that specializes in pulmonary rehabilitation, ask your doctor for further information about how to work with the clinicians. 3. Receive oxygen therapy to facilitate easier breathing.	While it doesn’t reverse or slow the effects of IPF, oxygen therapy will make breathing easier, and maintain consistent oxygen levels in your blood.

Develop_Self‐Esteem.txt	Begin_Revision	0.752	### Remove Your Negative Self-Esteem	16556	So , make a habit out of saying positive things about yourself and use the self-fulfilling prophecy to your advantage .	### Remove Your Negative Self-Esteem	16637	Instead , make a habit out of saying positive things about yourself and to yourself , and use the self-fulfilling prophecy to your advantage .	<replace><So><1><Instead><1>|||<insert><and><13>|||<insert><to><13>|||<insert><yourself><13>|||<insert><,><13>	True	Remove Your Negative Self-Esteem  1. Start from within. Ignore any and all destructive criticism or insults, including any from your past. Your opinion of yourself is the most important opinion of all, because you know yourself better than anyone else. Many of us have been hurt by others at some time. It is crucial not to internalize that abuse and let them continue to hurt us, because that means the other person wins. If we let go of the past, ignore hurtful negativity and make ourselves happy, then we win. 2. Create daily affirmations. Tell yourself that you are a wonderful person who deserves to be happy. Make a list of all the things you like about yourself. If you've made mistakes that prevent you from believing that you deserve to be happy, take measures to relieve that guilt. Apologize to people you may have hurt (if possible), learn from those mistakes and forgive yourself. 3. Start with small steps to gain confidence. Take small steps and make small choices to gain confidence in your ability to make a decision. As you become secure in your ability to make good choices, you will gain confidence in yourself, and be more secure about your abilities in general. * For example, if purchasing jeans makes you anxious because of the plethora of brands, colors, and styles, then just go with your instincts. Trust yourself and go with whatever feels right to you. And if you really feel you made a wrong decision in retrospect, the situation can be easily rectified by exchanging the jeans. 4. Don't always try to please others. It is great to be considerate of others, but think before sacrificing your own needs to please them. Bending over backwards for strangers, mere acquaintances or people you don't trust may leave you with the short end of the stick. In short, don't allow yourself to be used. 5. Be your own person. Don't try to copy anyone else. You will be at your best when you are being yourself because of your uniqueness. Strive to be your best and do not criticize yourself if you fall short of your expectations. 6. Avoid negative people. People who have a negative attitude which may rub off on you are not good for you. If you're timid, loud and aggressive people are probably not good for you, and vice versa. Whatever you do, do not compare yourself to others. Just be the best that you can be. 7. Face your fears and learn from your failures. We only fail when we do not make the best out of adversity. When something doesn't go the way we would like it to, there is something to be learned from that, which can be applied next time you are in a similar situation. Get up and try again. 8. Stop the negative thoughts. Try positive thinking on for size. The term “self-fulfilling prophecy” in relation to self-esteem basically states that whatever you believe about you, whether it be perfect or totally off base, becomes true. If you constantly tell yourself you are stupid or that you will never achieve success, you will in turn act as such.	.

Some susceptibility to skin disorders may be connected. 2. Describe any recent skin traumas. If you’ve suffered from a sunburn in the previous 2-3 months, it is possible that this might have helped to trigger an episode of vitiligo.

Understand what causes the smell to begin with. It is multiple types of mold (including black mold) growing in the internal drain hose inside your washer where you can’t see it. 2. Understand why it grows there. Google ""Mold growth"" and you will see that the biggest problem is high humidity (over 60%). This chart shows you at what relative humidity mold starts to grow. It starts at around 55% and by the time you get to 70% the chance of mold growth is close to 100%. Because it starts growing at about 55% we highly recommend you keep your relative humidity (RH) of your laundry area under 50% at all times. A dehumidifier is the best way to lower your RH. 3. Understand that cleaning your washer and leaving the door open will never solve the problem. They will just help with the odor for a little while. This picture is of the internal drain hose inside your washer where the black mold starts to grow. The internal drain hose should look milk-jug clear, unless it is a grey hose. Where the pipe looks dark is the black mold inside the pipe. Most internal drain hoses are ribbed pipes and once the mold starts to grow it is very difficult to clean it out. When you just occasionally use special cleaners you are not solving what caused the mold to start growing to start with. This is why Washer Fan™ Breeze™ is so important in permanently eliminating washer odor. 4. In order to stop the mold from growing, you have to remove at least one of the 4 components to mold growth. In this case you need to lower the humidity level inside your washer drum below 50%. You can do this with Washer Fan™ Breeze™. You can purchase a Washer Fan Breeze online, just do a google search for ""washer fan"". You can install it yourself in seconds and there are videos on the website showing you how to do it. When using Washer Fan Breeze, the only permanent solution for washer odor, you can permanently fix the problem rather than covering it up. 5."	This allows the air being pushed into the drum to be exhausted out the front. As air exhausts out the front, it brings high RH with it and thereby lowers the humidity level inside the drum.

Park in large, open spots and designated areas. Vans are typically longer than standard cars and require more room to park. When pulling into traditional parking lots, look for areas on the side of the lot where you can parallel park, open areas with multiple spots you can occupy, or areas sectioned off for large vehicles. If none of these areas are available, use your best judgement and either park carefully, wait for an opening, or find another lot. 2. Back into parking spots to make getting out easier. Whenever possible, you should back into parking spots instead of pulling into them. To do this, pull in front of the parking spot, brake, and put your car in reverse. Scan your mirrors to make sure the area is clear, then turn your wheel toward the spot and gently release your brake pedal. Slowly back your van into the parking spot, readjusting your vehicle as necessary. * Place a spotter or traffic cone behind the vehicle to make backing up easier. 3. Parallel park when normal spots are not available. Find a space large enough to comfortably fit your van and position your vehicle next to the car in front of it. Then, put your van in reverse and release the brakes. When you’re lined up with the car’s back bumper, turn your steering wheel toward the parking space and start backing into the parking spot.	Finally, pull your van forward to straighten it out.

Carry along a tote bag, backpack, or jacket to store the food in. 2. Sit as far away from the teacher as possible. If you sit in the front, turn sideways and pop your food into your mouth when your teacher is not looking. Or pretend to cough and then pop the food into your mouth while covering. Break your food into bite-size chunks under the desk if it is too large. 3. Use the concept of ""light travels in a straight line"". Hunch down and look at your teacher's eyes. Whenever anything blocks your view (e.g. another classmate's head) such that you cannot see your teacher's eyes, it means that he can't see you either. Works well with short teachers and tall classmates. 4. Bring a big sweatshirt that you can stick the bag or whatever it is you are eating in. Gradually keep taking small bits of the food you are eating. 5. Avoid bringing messy food. Try granola bars, jelly beans, hand-held jello, chocolate chips, etc. Opt for little foods that you can hide in your hand on the way to your mouth--raisins, nuts, jelly beans, M&Ms, etc., and food that won't crumble or make noise (crackers are generally not a good idea)."	.

Wear a collared shirt underneath for a dressy touch. Choose a short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirt with a collar to add a dressy layer to your outfit. This can be a button-down or polo, for instance. Put on the collared shirt first, then place the tee over top. This adds a more professional touch to your outfit, making it great for a night out or a dinner date. * To keep a neat and tidy appearance, choose a plain, solid-colored T-shirt. * You can wear this with jeans or trousers, for instance. 2. Wear a button-down open over top for a polished layer. Choose a striped, stylish button-down or a plaid, colorful flannel for another layer. Put on your T-shirt first, then put your arms through the sleeves of your outer layer. Don’t button up the shirt, so you can still see the tee underneath. This adds a refined touch to your outfit, making your T-shirt appear a bit dressier. * Wear a flannel shirt with your T-shirt if you are going to a concert or hanging out with friends. * Go with a professional button-down if you want to wear this look to the office on casual Friday. 3. Add a cardigan sweater to your ensemble for a business-casual look. Cardigans are warm, button-down sweaters that look great with T-shirts. Go with a fitted cardigan for a polished look, or try an oversized, long cardigan for a stylish accent. This layering piece ties your look together, so your favorite T-shirt will look great whether you are heading to work or running errands. * Wear a colored cardigan with a neutral tee if you want to brighten up your look. Pick a red, blue, or purple sweater, for instance. * Throw on a neutral cardigan if you want a subtle outfit. Choose shades like cream, black, or brown. 4. Throw on a jacket or blazer for a professional touch. Adding a blazer instantly makes your outfit more formal. If you have a plain shirt, you can wear a striped, plaid, or textured jacket. If you are wearing a striped or polka-dotted shirt, pair this with a plain blazer. * This is a great idea if you want to look professional in the workplace or dress for a lunch meeting. 5. Pair your tee with a vest for a stylish layer. If your shirt has a pattern or many colors, choose a neutral vest. If your shirt is plain and you want to add some embellishment, choose a vest with a fun pattern or interesting texture. * Vests helps your shirt look less casual, making this a great option for a night out, for school, or for work. 6. Rock a T-shirt as a dress if it is long enough. If you have a large, oversized shirt that covers you up enough, wear the tee as a dress! You can pair the shirt with stylish leggings.	.

Focus on fit. If your clothes don’t fit right, it won’t matter how attractive or fashionable they are; you won’t look well dressed. Clothes that are too small will look cheap and make you seem heavier; clothes that are too big will make you look sloppy.center|550px * Dresses can be difficult to fit properly since many women wear different sizes in tops and bottoms. In general, you'll know a dress fits well if the neckline lies flat whether you are sitting or standing, if all the seams are flat and straight, if the material doesn't pull or pucker around your chest or hips, and if the garment fits closely but not tightly. * If you’ve gained or lost weight recently, it’s especially important to discard or alter anything that no longer fits correctly. Take the time to evaluate your wardrobe and figure out what works and what doesn’t. 2. Know the best ways to flatter your figure. Every individual is different, and there are tremendous variations within each group, but most women fall into the apple, pear, banana, or hourglass categories.center|550px * Apple-shaped women tend to carry weight around their middles. These women typically look best in A-line dresses and clothing that emphasizes the bust and legs while deemphasizing the waist. * Pear-shaped women are smaller on top but larger in the hips and thighs. They usually look best in A-line dresses, layered tops, and simple, darker-colored bottoms. * Banana-shaped women are slim all over. These women typically look good in most clothing, but they can make the most of their shape by wearing clothes that create curves. Flared pants, cinched waistlines, and tapered jackets can help accomplish that goal. * Hourglass-shaped women have slim waists with fuller hips and breasts. They look great in tailored pieces and wrap dresses. 3. Determine which colors look best on you. Try looking at the veins inside your wrist. Do they look more green or more blue?center|550px * If they look green, you have a skin tone with a yellow base. Warmer colors will look better on you, so try off-white, red, yellow, orange, and brown, as well as yellow-tinted greens and blues. Avoid pastels. * If they look blue, you have a skin tone with a pink base. Cooler colors will look better on you, so try white, pastels, and jewel tones. * When in doubt, there’s nothing wrong with sticking to mostly neutral colors. Black, gray, and brown look great on nearly everyone. Add pops of brighter color here and there – a bright blue necklace or a deep red belt, for example – to keep your outfits looking interesting. 4. Assess the areas of your body that you are uncomfortable showing. For example, if you aren’t comfortable showing too much of your legs, or are self-conscious about your midsection, keep this in mind as you look for clothes, and avoid buying mini-skirts or shirts that are tight around the stomach.center|550px 5. Focus on classic, rather than trendy, styles. It’s more important to dress your body in attractive, flattering clothes that work for your figure than to follow every trend as it develops. Forcing yourself into certain colors, cuts, and styles just because the fashion magazines are featuring them won’t make you well dressed. Stick to what suits you.center|550px *	Be willing to experiment! You may be surprised by how flattering a new style can be.

In general, dental implants are much cheaper abroad than they are in the United States. For example, the average cost of getting dental implants in the U.S. is approximately $4,000, whereas it can be as little as $1,600 in Mexico and $850 in India. According to Patients Beyond Borders, dental tourism is becoming increasingly popular.	Some of the most popular destinations for dental implant surgery are Europe, India, and the Philippines, but other options include Argentina, Costa Rica, Africa, Hungary, Poland, and Spain.

Select a healthy-looking plant with several buds yet to open. Orchids are often available at florists, over the internet, or even at some grocery or home improvement stores. Do not collect orchid plants from the wild, since they will not survive out of their habitat! 2. Turn your plant around to determine its best angles. Draw it from different angles, and maybe take some photographs for later reference. 3. Select your drawing materials. What medium do you mostly use? Pencil, pen and ink, colored pencil, gouache, scratchboard, watercolor, pastel, oils? Select that which works best for you. 4. Choose the size. What size do you want your completed piece to be? Do some preliminary sketches (artists call these 'thumbnails', drawings about 4"" by 5""), to work out composition of light, medium and dark values, but not any details. * A full-size drawing on tracing paper is ideal. It's much less expensive per piece than the paper the finished piece will be on and it's easy to layer if you decide on completely changing the composition halfway through the initial drawing! 5. Start with a gesture drawing of the plant. Delineate the main line of the flowering stem, going down to where it inserts by the leaves (with some species the flowering stems emerge from the middle of the new growth, sometimes from the base of the plant; every species is different). Then very carefully draw the leaves, since they move around the least. Note the midrib, how it inserts further down into the core of the plant, whether the leaves wrap around each other, and any identifying features of the leaves and base of the plant, such as pseudobulbs and roots. Carefully draw the buds, noting dimension and being careful about proportions, and, working down the stem, drawing the flowers each in turn. If you feel that the flowers won't last long at this point, take some close-up photos and spend the time drawing and painting the flowers - the leaves will hopefully stay green and fresh for a long time after the flowers have faded! 6. Plan the placement of the plant on your support. Make sure you leave enough paper or canvas around your subject to go under the mat or frame. Prepare your surface for work: stretch an oil or acrylic canvas, choose your paper or board for any other media you prefer. 7. Transfer the drawing, once you're completely satisfied with it, onto the good paper. Do this by sandwiching a piece of graphite transfer paper (available in art supply stores or you can make your own) between the tracing paper preliminary and the good paper and tracing over my first drawing with a ball-point pen. The graphite from the transfer paper is transferred by the pressure of the pen onto the paper underneath it. Try not to erase any lines because that will abrade the surface of the paper, making your results uneven. If the transfer paper lines are a bit too dark, you can lift them a bit by gently pressing a grey kneaded eraser on top of them and lifting until you get the right value of line. 8. When your outlines are correct, do your painting or drawing of your subject, working from lightest areas to darkest areas, and protecting the paper by putting another large piece of clean tracing paper underneath your hand. Cut a window a few inches square in the tracing paper 'shield' so that you can work one area at a time in that square. It works well to tape the tracing paper down near the edges of the good paper so that the papers don't rub together. (If you are right-handed, work from upper left to lower right. A left-handed artist would work from upper right to lower left.) Very carefully lift up and move the tracing paper 'window' from one area to another, trying not to smudge the drawing underneath. When you are painting, you have to be more careful, and often use larger-sized 'windows'. The tracing paper technique doesn't work with oil or any other slow-drying media, since the paper can stick to the wet paint. Only use this for egg tempera, watercolor, pen and ink or gouache and don't move your tracing paper window until the area you completed is fully dry. 9. Work from light to dark, as mentioned before. When you feel you're almost finished with the piece, take the tracing paper 'window' off and put the painting or drawing in front of a mirror. The image will be reversed and will often show up any design, value, or color flaws. Go back to the drawing board if need be and make any required changes. 10."	Sometimes it helps to put it away for a day or so. If you are very pleased with the work, put it in your portfolio or in a frame and submit it to any of several exhibitions. If not, it's back to the drawing board. Do you need a better excuse to go buy a new orchid?

Explain that you cope the best you can. Living with chronic pain means that you have to adopt coping strategies. These strategies help you make it through the day even if you are struggling with pain. Because of your coping mechanisms, you may appear happier or healthier than you actually feel. * Because of this, the person may think you feel better than you actually do. They may say things like, “You are so happy! Your pain must be better!” Explain to them that you are still in pain, but you are coping and choosing not to be miserable. * You may say, “I choose to laugh and focus on the positive instead of be miserable. However, I still am in a great deal of pain.” 4. Ask the person not to give medical advice. Many people who talk to people who suffer from chronic pain try to help by suggesting cures, treatments, or medical advice. Most of this is well-meaning advice, but to someone with chronic pain, it’s frustrating. Often, you have probably already tried it or heard about it. Ask the person not to try to help you in this way. * You may say, “I know you want to help, and I appreciate it.	My doctor and I have tried everything that is available to treat my pain.”

Flip turns are primarily used during the free-style stroke which is also sometimes referred to as the crawl stroke. Flip turns can also be used during the back stroke which employs a slightly different flip-turn technique. This wikihow web page describes how to perform a flip turn during the free-style stroke as you approach the wall of the swimming pool for your lane. The goal of the flip turn and pushing off from the wall is to transfer the energy and momentum you have built up in one direction so both are refocused in the opposite direction. This allows lap swimming and competitive swimming to be performed as efficiently and quickly as possible with minimal loss of energy and momentum. 2. Get in the pool and make sure you have goggles on. 3. Start swimming the free style (i.e., crawl stroke) for the length of the pool. When you are fairly close to the wall, do a front flip, and then quickly push off the wall with your feet while simultaneously twisting your body so your face resumes facing the bottom of the pool. ""Fairly close"" is relative depending on how tall you are and the distance from your feet to your hips...as well as how fast you are traveling with your swim stroke. For an adult male swimming at a fairly good pace, the flip will typically begin about 2.5 to 3 feet from the wall. 4. As you do the flip, have your legs rotate over from the hips and minimize bending at the knees. Have your feet land about 25 inches deep in the water and about 2 or 3 inches (ideally) from the wall (for an adult). After your feet come over, extend your legs and make gentle but quick contact with the wall with the bottoms of your feet. Proceed to energetically push off so your body is now going in the opposite direction, meaning you are now heading towards the other end of the pool (from which you came). 5. As you begin to push off the wall with your feet, your torso should be about 22 to 25 inches under water (for an adult). Towards the end of the flipping motion, give your body a small twist so your shoulders come around and face the bottom of the pool. At the same time, extend your arms in a diving motion and push off hard from the wall with your feet and legs so you glide thru the water anywhere from 10 to 15 feet (typically) for an adult. After pushing off, glide thru the water so you maximize distance traveled while at the same time having your head gradually break the surface of the water with your arms resuming your swimming stroke with no break in momentum or timing. When pushing off from the wall, you want to slightly angle your arms so your body actually flows in a diagonal line with point A being where your feet push off and point B being where the top of your head first breaks the surface of the water. 6."	Just prior to this moment, exhale a slight amount of air thru your nose to prevent water from going up your nose.

Or your parents say you have to start buying your own clothes, makeup (if you're a young lady, and etc)? And do you like shopping at name brand stores like Hollister, Aeropostale, etc?	Well, as a teen, these tricks and tips may help you.
Dress_on_a_Low_Budget_As_a_Young_Teen.txt	Begin_Revision	0.861	## Steps	244	Though be smart and do n't spend a lot on simple things like these .	### Purchasing Your Makeup	313	However , be smart and do n't spend a lot on simple things like these .	<insert><However><1>|||<replace><Though><1><,><2>	True	Steps  1. Think of where you like to shop and how much money you have to spend. 2. Now make a list of items that you have that you can wear. For example, if you already have shorts in several washes, and they fit, try not to buy more, since you properly don't need anymore, and buying more may just waste money because you're still growing and honestly people are not going to pay much attention to how often you wear a certain pair. 3. After you have made a list, think of where you like to buy certain things at. For example, let's say, if a person prefers to buy most denim bottoms at brands like Hollister and American Eagle, or fashion tops (the kind of shirts that go out of style fast) at places like Forever 21, Wet seal, and Ross, they would write them down. 4. Consider thinking about how much you are willing to spend? For example, jeans last for around 2-3 years during your teenage years, due to changes in height. Search for cheap prices. 5. Amounts: you don't need ten ton of basics. 6. Tip: Buy your basics first, then add in fun stuff for a awesome wardrobe. Like i said before, you don't need several more shorts or any basic items. A few of each wash/color will be enough (light, medium, dark wash and neutral colors mostly for things like cardigans and camis). Basics: Jeans, shorts, capris, hoodies, jackets, camis, cardigans, shoes, t-shirts, etc. 7. Now for makeup, as a young teen you start to get into fashion and makeup. You can skip this step if you're already into makeup. Before you do anything with makeup check with your parents and see what you're allowed to wear. 8. Tip: Figuring out what your parents say you can wear will help when your shopping and also you won't waste money on things your parents later tell you that you can't wear. If you're just starting out, only get some basics to get a feel of how to use makeup. Basics are; concealer, powder, blush & bronzer, mascara, lipbalm/lipgloss. 9. Makeup budget: Figure out what you want to buy and where you want to buy it. 10. Getting an idea of how much your willing to pay for what, where you buy what, and how often you buy what. 11. Makeup isn't something that you have to buy that often, since it normally lasts for about 3-4 months, other than mascara. 12. Tip: Buy mascara at drugstores (Walmart) because you throw them out every month. Unless you're like me, and are addicted to buying makeup. 13. As far as on a budget for makeup, I say, buy simple things at the drugstores. For example, people are not gonna care very much if you buy cheap lipgloss 14. (you don't really need lipstick as a teen) or any other lip product at the drugstore. 15. Tip: Avoid buying several lip products since they all do about the same thing, a few different shades are nice but you will want to buy more of other important things. 16. What to buy at the drugstore. Try buying most everyday used items at drugstore since you use it more often and will have to buy it a lot more.Buy most of these at the drugstore to save money for more important things and to be able to afford them all. 17. Lip products. 18. Eyeliner 19. Mascara 20. Setting powders (Rimmel and Nyc are great) 21. Everyday blush & bronzer (Elf - Blush & Bronzer duo $3 works well and Nyc - Sunny Bronzer $3) 22. Some eyeshadows 23. Brow gel (Elf - Brow gel $1 or Maybelline great lash clear mascara) 24. Brow pencil 25. What to spend more on. 26. Your skin is young and delicate so take care of it and spend more on face makeup. 27. Concealer (mac $20) 28. Foundation ($20-30) 29. Primers (a must have for young skin) 30. Special makeup: for example Urban Decay naked palettes are amazing, but expensive. It is worth it. 31. Tip: don't use up special makeup on a daily basis because it is expensive. 32. Accessories: Buy as much as you like, because they make up a good outfit. 33.	Forever 21 has several accessories priced perfect for almost any budget. Do consider paying more for a good quality purse. Check out Target and K-mart first, though.

Firstly, if you’re not overly comfortable with your body, then dim the lights. Everyone looks great in flattering lighting. * To feel sexier, imagine you are someone else who you think is sexy. Pretend you are them while you are undressing. You will surprised at just how much sexier you feel when creating a little role play in your head. 2. Turn undressing in to a mini performance. Use exaggerated movements while still remaining feminine. 3. Remember to act like a lady. Undressing like a man after a football match in the rain, is not going to make you feel sexy. It’s going to make you feel like, well.. a man undressing after a football match in the rain. 4. If you’re unbuttoning a shirt or top, use small delicate hand movements. Don’t get flustered if the buttons stick. Try to make it effortless and chic! If you’re doing this in front of someone, try only using one hand while having the other on your hip. Look at the person intently as you do this. This won’t just make you feel sexy, it is sexy! 5.	Shack your head and let your hair flow out.

Having a crush: Don't just look for a boyfriend for the sake of it! Crushes are the first place to look for boyfriend potential. After all, crushes are all about thinking they're date-worthy. And by this I do NOT mean think of a celebrity as your boyfriend, because odds are you'll probably never date them (so get off the idea of dating Aston Merrygold or Taylor Lautner or whoever it is you dream about!) Go for boys you're fairly familiar with; like your next door neighbor's son or a boy in your class. 2. Making sure he's available: If he's dating someone else that means he's off limits. He may tell his friends that it's casual, but girls are much more sensitive and think things like love are always serious. So ask the people closet to him first if he's with somebody to avoid any conflict. 3. Be acquaintances: Get to know this guy first before you ask him out. Find out about what he likes, dislikes, wants to be when he's older- even his favorite TV show! Maybe you'll find that you have things in common. 4. Find an event: Special things like the school disco or the Halloween party are great events to prompt the idea of dating. This means both you and that special boy will be familiar with the surroundings. Plus, you have some friends there to turn to if the date doesn't go so well (fingers crossed it won't though!) 5. Be confident: Before you pluck up the courage to ask this boy out, relax your arms, clear your face, speak up and smile. This will indicate that you're approachable and bubbly when you come to meet this boy. Boys don't really fancy girls who hide behind their hair and are too shy. They like girls who stand out. Make yourself known. 6. Making the situation comfortable: One of the biggest mistakes a girl can make is to pass the boy a note during class. This boy will almost definitely tell all his friends about it, and we all know what boys are like- they'll hound you about it! If he's alone, tell him you want to ask him something and go for it, head on (waffling indicates that you won't be able to hold a conversation!)	You only care about the boy, not his friends.

Pick a protein and vegetable based food. Check that the food has about 75% protein and 25% vegetables for hatchlings, and that it is 25% protein and 75% vegetable content for adults. Hatchlings (or baby turtles) are about 85% carnviorous. But as they get older, they are more herbivorous. 2. For adult turtles, they should get dark leafy greens or carrots every day. Hatchlings should only get vegetables 1 time a week. 3. A turtles shell and bones get stronger when given calcium, just like a human's teeth and bones. But turtles can not have milk. So how do they get the calcium? A calcium turtle bone (which is easily found at a local petstore), or save the eggshells the next time you make eggs. Then dry the eggs in an oven for about 30 minutes or less at 360 degrees Fahrenheit, or 182 degrees Celsius. Then take them out, grind them in a blender, and feed them to your turtle in their feeding bowl. 4. Give turtles live fish and/or shrimp. If is very important to give it to them. Go to your local petstore and get fish. Add 1 fish to your turtle's tank every day. Just 1 will be okay for an adult turtles. Remove any dead fish from the tank after your turtle has finished eating. * You may hear that goldfish are fine, but they can only survive in 65 to 75 degrees fahreheit.	.

The topic that you will talk about should be something you both know which will make your partner think that it's a good idea to start talking, too. * Ask your partner general questions, which means not too personal, and not to open. At the very beginning, it might be a bit annoying to your partner to see that you are asking so may questions, or so many personal questions at the beginning, which can make them escape from your questions by leaving the chat room or by closing their phone. Take it slowly and easy. No need to rush. If you can't find anything to talk about, make your partner start talking with some unnoticed ways: * ""How was your day?"" * ""So, what's your favorite hobbies?"" * Know when to over ask. When you feel that your partner is happy answering your questions, ask more questions. You can also use that chance to ask more personal information. 3. Avoid over complimenting. Complimenting is always good with friends or with your crush. Over complimenting might make crush think whether you're lying or sexing them. It can also cause to them not to believe you again, which will make them avoid thinking to like you. You don't need to lie to say good compliment. Just say what good things you think about them the Here are some good compliments: * ""You look amazing while wearing the outfit you wore yesterday!"" * ""You don't need to wear makeup, by the way.

Have a protein- and fiber-filled breakfast. Mornings are always rushed and sometimes breakfast might take a backseat to finishing some last-minute homework or brushing your hair.

Set your alarm clock five minutes earlier and try these tasty breakfast options: * An egg scramble with tomatoes and some cheese. * Whole grain toast with peanut butter and a piece of fruit. * Whole-grain cereal with a few strawberries and skim milk. Look for a cereal with at least 5 g fiber and less than 5 g sugar. 2. Pack a veggie-filled taco or wrap for school lunch. It’s easiest to eat healthy at school when you pack your lunch the day before, so you don’t get tempted by less-healthy options from the school cafeteria.

Deliver_a_Baby.txt	Begin_Revision	0.532	## Steps	2724	When the placenta emerges , do not pull on it .	## Steps	2812	If the placenta emerges before help arrives , do not pull on it .	<replace><When><1><If><1>|||<insert><before><5>|||<insert><help><5>|||<insert><arrives><5>	True	"Steps  1. Remain calm. People have to do this all the time; you'll do just fine. Birth is totally natural and most of what you need to do is help the mother relax and let her body do the work. 2. Assess the situation. Labor (the first part of childbirth, where the body is getting ready to deliver) can take a long time. To determine how far along the labor is, first ask the mother if she feels the baby coming or if she feels a strong urge to push. Now time the contractions from the beginning of one to the beginning of the next. Regular contractions less than 2 minutes apart indicate that the baby is ready, as does bulging of the vaginal opening during contractions. If you've still got time, try to get to a hospital, doctor's office or midwife. 3. Call for help if possible. If you've decided you don't have time to get to a childbirth professional, call 911 for an ambulance. That way, help will arrive soon if you experience complications. The dispatcher should also be able to either talk you through the delivery or connect you to someone who can. 4. Clean your hands and arms well with soap (preferably antibacterial) and water. If soap and water is not available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizing product or rubbing alcohol. Whatever you can do, try to get your hands as clean as possible to prevent giving the mother or baby an infection. Wear sterile nitrile gloves if available. 5. Find and prepare a birthing area. * A mother birthing in a standing or vertical position is far more effective and comfortable than on her back, but this sometimes requires a third person to help hold her. While vertical there is the benefit of gravity, less likelihood of a perineum tear, and an increase in the flow of blood since the baby is not putting pressure on an artery. She may not want to labor in this position, but it is superior for pushing and the actual birth. Make sure the floor/surface is clean and as soft as possible, and someone is positioned to catch the baby. * If you are the only assistant available, it may be easiest to have the mother deliver while lying on her back or side. Again, find a clean, flat surface for her to lie on, and make it as comfortable as you can. Cover it with a clean sheet or sheets if possible because there will be bodily fluids involved. If it is slightly higher at the mother's head than at her feet, gravity will help the delivery. 6. Have the mother remove lower clothing. If she needs to lie down to give birth, have her lie on her side. Support her head and back with pillows, if possible. 7. When delivery begins, have the mother move to the birthing position, either on her back with her legs spread and bent at the knees, or in a supported, vertical, squatting position. Or whatever position ""feels right"" to the mother. Remember that nature has control here and women usually just ""know"" what to do if they remain calm. 8. Instruct the mother to take deep, slow breaths. Pain can be controlled to different extents through mental relaxation and by concentrating on deep breathing instead of panicking or being distracted by everything that is going on. Different people have different levels of mental control, but deep, slow breathing is always a benefit during childbirth. Remind the woman that her body knows what to do and to just relax and go with it. This can help her breathe more easily and deeply if she feels more relaxed. 9. Tell the mother to push when the baby's head arrives at the vaginal opening during contractions. When a contraction starts, the mother should take a deep breath, hold it, and steadily push for 10 seconds. The mother should stop pushing between contractions so she can rest. Or instruct her to just push when she feels the urge and to rest when the urge goes away. You may not want to count the seconds she is pushing because it can raise the womans anxiety level and you may accidentally encourage her to push when it's not the best time. Do not tell a woman to push if she has no urge of her own to do so. 10. Apply gentle pressure with one hand to the area below the vaginal opening as the baby's head starts to come out. This prevents the baby from coming out too fast. 11. Support the baby's head when you see it, but do not pull on its head or its body. Allow it to come out slowly; it should turn to the side naturally. 12. Clean the baby's head and nose as soon as the head is out. Use a suction bulb if possible. If a suction bulb is not available, use a clean towel to gently stroke downwards over its mouth and nose. If the umbilical cord is wrapped around the baby's neck, insert a finger between the cord and the neck and gently try to slip the cord over the head. If you cannot easily do this, proceed with the delivery. Do not cut the umbilical cord. 13. Guide the first shoulder out. Gently placing your hands on the baby's head, guide it downward as the mother pushes until the top shoulder is out. If the baby appears stuck, see the Tips section below immediately. 14. Guide the rest of the body out. Gently support the baby's head and body as it emerges and guide it up out of the vaginal opening. Hold the baby with a towel so that it does not slip out of your hands. This could happen slowly or quickly, so be prepared. 15. Hold the delivered baby with two hands, keeping its head down (about 45 degree angle) to allow fluids to drain. Its feet should be above its head, but do not hold the baby by the feet. Hold it so that its head is at about the same height as the vaginal opening. When the baby starts crying, wipe or suction its nose and mouth again. If the baby does not start crying, see the Tips section below immediately. 16. Dry the baby and wrap it in clean, dry towels or clothes. Cover the baby's entire body--including the head--except for the face. 17. Lay the baby on the mother's abdomen or chest, being careful not to pull the umbilical cord, and encourage the mother to nurse the baby, as this will help stimulate the contractions necessary to expel the placenta. Placing the baby skin-to-skin with the mother will help keep the infant warm. 18. Do not tie off or cut the umbilical cord. 19. Massage the mother's abdomen to help her expel the placenta."	Let it come out slowly and then carefully place it in a large plastic bag or clean towel and lay it near the baby so as not to sever or pull the umbilical cord. Do not worry about cutting or even tying off the cord. A distressed baby can benefit from the nutrients and oxygen still in the placenta. Never try to pull out a placenta.

List the reasons why you avoid meditation. Handle the problems. * If you don't like spending an hour meditating, or you get frustrated easily, then try half an hour. Or ten minutes. One true moment in meditation will be greater than one hour spent fidgeting and grumbling. * If you feel too busy to be still (in body or mind), then give yourself permission to be completely and totally free during your meditation time. (Yes, that means turn off your cell phone.) After all, you deserve to be peaceful as much as you deserve to eat, sleep, or breathe. It is a part of who you are. Furthermore, the world around you—your family, your friends, your companion animals, even strangers—deserve for you to be peaceful, too. * If you are distracted by your environment, then change what you can control, wait for quietude, or find a more serene location. * If you feel like a failure, then remind yourself that in meditation, there is no such thing as failure. Or success, really. Do not be attached to your results. They do not tell you who you are, only where you are. * If you feel physically uncomfortable in your posture, then try sitting on a pillow or in a chair. Lie down if you have to do so. You can always try other postures later. * If you feel emotionally or physically disturbed (other than how you're sitting), then you may have some mental or emotional issues that you need to address. Meditation may help you with your problems, but usually other techniques are quite effective too, sometimes more effective. Try for example to write your thoughts down. * If you have other reasons for avoiding meditation, analyze them and create your own solutions. You know what you need better than anyone. 2. Schedule meditation into your day. While it may not motivate you to meditate, at least you won't have anything else to do at that moment (it's true—check your schedule!). 3. Try meditating first thing in the morning or last thing at night. At these times, you will probably be least busy, so there will be a limited number of excuses. Moreover, early morning meditation may help you focus throughout the day, and late night meditation may help you sleep deeply. 4. Make meditation enjoyable rather than a chore. Perhaps you could create a ""meditation zone"" in your house or play soothing music. 5. Find a community. You may enjoy meditating with others."	.

Ask another lawyer. In order to find a criminal defense attorney, you need to meet with a few to talk about your case. You should begin by getting referrals. One good source of referrals is other lawyers. * For example, you might have used a lawyer to draft a will or to help you with a divorce. If so, call them up and ask if they can recommend a criminal defense attorney. 2. Contact your local or state bar association. You can also get a referral by contacting your nearest bar association. Bar associations are organizations made up of lawyers. You can find the nearest organization by visiting the American Bar Association’s website. * Each bar association works a little differently. With some, you call a phone number and get a referral to one attorney. * With other bar associations, you can browse a list or directory of criminal defense attorneys in your state or city. 3. Look in the phone book. You can also get referrals the old fashion way by looking in your phone book. Check the Yellow Pages. See if the attorney advertises that he or she practices criminal defense. You will want someone who spends most of their time handing defense matters. * You might not be able to tell from the listing whether the attorney handles criminal law cases. Since most lawyers have websites now, you should go online and check their website. 4. Request a public defender if you have no money. You are entitled to legal help if you are facing time in prison. Accordingly, states must offer you a public defender if you qualify. You should ask the judge for a public defender when you attend your first court hearing. * To qualify for a public defender, you must be low income. You will have to fill out an application reporting your finances. * Public defenders are qualified attorneys and you shouldn’t reject a public defender out of hand. * You don’t really get to choose your public defender. Instead, someone will be assigned to you. If you don’t get along with your public defender, then you can complain to the defender’s office.	.

No watches, rings, bracelets or anything like that! Keep it simple and only wear the items mentioned above. 6. Take note of each and everything around you. Whenever you find yourself in a seated position, start noticing the different things happening around you. This is for work that may require detail. 7. When you are seated, sit in a curved position, with your legs touching your chin and your thumb in your mouth (not like babies, just the nail). If someone asks why you're sitting like that or why are you so weird, just tell them it's your way of doing things. 8. Always have something to eat. Be it small snacks like chocolate, a piece of cake or coffee. Or even just eat sugar cubes straight-up. * When eating cake with strawberry on it, (it seems to be his favorite) finish the cake first before eating the strawberry. * Drink sweetened coffee (adding milk is optional) often but make sure it's not too much caffeine for you! Black tea is acceptable too, but make sure you add a few sugar cubes. 9. If you ever have to pick something up, hold it from the top with you thumb and index finger (make sure you don't drop it). You can also hold a book/Death Note upside down only if you can read it upside down. 10. Talk in a quiet but serious manner. Don't raise your voice until it's something unexpected. 11.	.

Be able to recognize common types of dysfunctional thinking. Dysfunctional thinking is a way of framing the world so that you feel you’re always fighting an uphill battle. Some common examples include: * Polarized thinking: Not allowing for any gray areas in life, or thinking in “black and white.” * Filtering or discounting the positives: Focusing on the negative of a situation and ignoring any positives. * Fortune-telling: Thinking that you know what will happen in the future. * Mind-reading: Thinking you know that others are thinking badly of you or that you are responsible for their negative feelings. * Overgeneralization: Thinking that one bad experience guarantees more bad experiences. * Blaming: Blaming yourself for things you are not responsible. * Emotional reasoning: Thinking with emotions or letting emotions affect how you perceive an event. * ”Should statements”: Using terms such as should, must, and ought to in your thinking; this is a form of judging yourself. * Magnification and minimization: Thinking that make issues seem larger than they are or trying to ignore issues. * Labeling: Using terms that diminish your whole self-concept by being known as a certain trait or mistake. 2. Find a journal to write in. Journaling can be a useful tool in order to analyze your own automatic thoughts without outside help. Journaling can help you identify and change automatic thoughts. This practice has also been shown to help decrease stress, which can be a byproduct of depression and loneliness. * Find whatever works best for you. This can be a notebook, loose-leaf notebook paper, or your computer. 3. Monitor your emotions in your journal. Our thoughts greatly influence how we feel and how we interpret and perceive our environments, our futures, and ourselves. People who suffer with depression often have thoughts that they are worthless, unlovable, or undeserving, and they often have thoughts that their environments are overwhelming, have insurmountable obstacles, and that their futures are hopeless. * Many who suffer from depression feel powerless to change how they feel and the course of their lives. Our thoughts greatly influences our feelings and behaviors, which is the basis for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT has been shown to be successful for treating depression. Relapse depression symptoms were much lower for those who had undergone CBT than for those who were being treated with medications alone. * A great way to start this process is to monitor your emotions and automatic thoughts by recording them in a journal or daily record. Start first by noticing mood changes, then begin to analyze what your thoughts had been just prior to feeling differently. * For example: * Event: I received poor feedback on my presentation at work. * Feelings: I felt stupid. * Here is another example: * Event: I forgot to sign the birthday card for my boss. * Feeling: I felt regretful and embarrassed 4. Write down your automatic thoughts.	Then you can evaluate these thoughts to determine how they are dysfunctional, challenge them by looking for evidence for and against the thought.

If you know why the dog is underweight, such as a bitch that has recently raised a litter of strong, greedy puppies, or a rescue dog has been mistreated, then fattening up the dog will be relatively straight forward. * Be sure to monitor the dog who is underweight, so that you can find any issues that might be easy to fix. For example, if you have several dogs, the answer can be as simple as the other dogs stealing your underweight dog's food. 2. Assess the overall health of your dog. All kinds of illnesses can interfere with the body's ability to process food and get the goodness out of it, leading to weight loss. If this is the case, the dog will almost certainly show some signs including decreased appetite, increased thirst, lack of energy, vomiting, diarrhea, or a change of body shape. * Conditions that can cause weight loss include lack of pancreatic enzymes, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, kidney disease, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. * Again, if you notice any of these symptoms then a vet check is for the best. 3. Get your dog checked by a veterinarian if you suspect they are ill or have unexplained weight loss. If your dog suddenly has a poor appetite for no reason, it's best to consult a professional before the problem gets out of control.	.

Eat natural items. On a detox, you are only supposed to eat NATURAL items. Do not eat processed foods- instead make your own meals from scratch and use natural flavors, olive oil, and spices. 2. Increase the amount of vegetables and fruits you eat. You are supposed to eat a small portion of fruits and vegetables with every meal. Always have fresh fruit and veggies in the fridge. Cut them up right after you buy them so when you want to snack, you eat cut up melon or carrots instead of chips or ice cream. Also, you can buy frozen fruit and vegetables which can sometime be cheaper than buying fresh fruit. 3. Consider vegetarianism. A vegetarian diet is proven to have major health benefits for many reasons- one being that you eat natural, plant based foods instead. On a detox you can have protein, but it cannot be from animals (only fish). Make your diet consist of nuts, fish, beans, and tofu- they are all healthy and natural. 4. Limit your drink choices. On a detox you can only have water and non-caffeinated which is somewhat extreme.	Instead drink lemon with water, tea, and can have a few cups of coffee each day (no more than 3 cups per day). In addition, do not drink alcohol or try to limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Also, milk is good for your health, but you can still substitute whole milk with soy milk or almond milk for extra protein.

Create one goal for each session. Your study sessions are most effective if they have some direction. Just blindly studying can be overwhelming and you may waste time fumbling to figure out where to start. Before each study session, figure out what topics are most pressing and set goals. * For example, if you're studying for a math final, focus on one concept each day. You can study multiplication one day and things like division the next. * You can also set goals based on days of the week. Focus on your math and science courses on Mondays and Wednesdays and your humanity courses on Thursdays and Fridays, for example. 2. Study with a positive attitude. If you see studying as a chore, you're likely to get frustrated and burn out. Instead of seeing studying as something you have to do, look at the positives. Think of this as a way to improve your skills and abilities and get the most out of your education. * Studying can be stressful, and it's important to address and challenge stressful thoughts. For example, don't think, ""I'm a mess. I'm never going to understand this."" Instead think, ""I'm sure if I work a little each day, I can figure out this material."" 3. Start with difficult material first. You'll be most energetic at the beginning of your study period. Therefore, it makes sense to begin by studying the most challenging materials then. Tackle the most difficult subjects and topics first before targeting your strong points. * For example, if you're really struggling understanding a concept for a philosophy class, study your notes and reading on that concept first. Then, you can move on to easier topics. 4. Rewrite your notes. Studying requires a lot of memorization. It can help to simply rewrite your notes and rewording them as you go. Read over all your notes for one session and then rewrite on a separate sheet of paper. This will force you to engage with the material and write it in your own words again, which increases understanding and helps you remember what you've learned. 5. Use memory games. Memory games can help you remember tough concepts and terms. You can use visualization techniques or string together words that help you remember concepts. These can be highly useful for an exam. * For example, a well known memory device is Kings Play Cards On Flat Green Stools, used to help you remember the taxonomy order used to classify species (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species). * You can also use visualization."	Picture your Aunt Jeanette talking on the floor of Congress to help you remember.

Get your hair layered. Now, Liz has VERY layered hair that is straight yet a little wavy. Some good advice is to take a picture of her to your hair dresser and get it cut that way. Oh, and you don't have to dye your hair dark red like hers. Remember, no one said you had to look exactly like Liz,you could dye it light brown maybe or auburn if you wanted also or just not even dye it at all. Try wearing really really sloppy ponytails and buns, but it'll take time to perfect the Liz sloppy ponies! 2. Don't overdo the Makeup. Liz wears very VERY natural colors except for lipstick. Try browns and greys, but she does sometimes wear light pink and gold.Oh, and Liz wears her glasses. So, if you have bad vision but you never wear you glasses, try wearing them a little more. 3. Try to find some shoes that resemble hers. Liz always seems to have on a pair of Nike high and low dunks all the time. Now, for some reason these shoes are insanely expensive so try getting a couple pairs that are on sale. And try to get a pair of moccasins, too. She is somewhere between indie, tomboy, and a hint of girlie so get a pair if you want. And Liz hates high heels. She once said in an interview that she thinks their torture and would never do that to herself. But isn't her, so add anything you want to your new style because remember Liz likes to be different and unique, too. * Center of Outfit. Liz said in an interview that she centers her outfits around her shoes. So if you have purple shoes on one day, center your outfit around the color purple! 4. Save money when you shop. Now, Liz doesn't like to buy things expensive so she has said before she mostly shops and thrift stores and Urban Outfitters $9.99 and under sale. You could also try Forever21 and other places like that. Oh and her solid colored hoodies, I'm pretty sure they're from American Apparel. 5. Accessorize! Liz wears necklaces that are knotted and she has this cute little golden locket she wears and sometimes even lets it hang open. She doesn't wear earrings a lot but when she does she wears these silver dangly ones that look like leaves. She has two pairs of WayFare sunglasses, she has a red pair and a yellow/white pair. She also has those beanies that slouch in the back and she has a bright yellow flat bill hat. 6. Go over how to get the ultimate look. Now, Liz is really skinny. But she's not anorexic. She probably just has a high metabolism and a small bone frame. If you think your to big, go on a diet and exercise. But you don't have to, if you like your body the way it is then don't go on a diet. Try doing things that no one does, like wear your jacket around your waist or not use like in every sentence! She is very different and cute. 7. Remember Liz's outfits revolve around her shoes! 8. LAYER! Liz seems to layer almost every outfit! She wears vests over t-shirts and one time in an episode she was wearing a sweater vest over a plaid shirt. Try to think outside the box with what you pick to wear.	.

Figure out what areas you are uncomfortable with. You can easily cover up or fix most problems. 2. Pick out the basics of your outfit. I recommend a cotton dress, lightly colored. Make sure little or no cleavage is showing. Also make sure the dress at least reaches your knees. Apply moisturizer to anywhere your skin will show. 3. If you are uncomfortable with your arms or it is going to be cold, wear a button-down cardigan that is well-fitted to your body. Avoid pockets, as they will make you look bulky, and zippers as they will make you look too casual. If you aren't wearing a sweater, apply moisturizer to your arms and pluck any unusually dark or long hairs. 4. Now, for your legs. Try skin-colored pantyhose. If you don't like pantyhose, shave carefully to the length of the dress and use plenty of moisturizer. Don't wear spandex leggings as they will make you look casual. 5. For shoes, you are well-off with light-colored heels. If you are uncomfortable with heels try a nice pair of clean, dressy flats, with NO SOCKS. Make sure that if your feet are showing they are clean and moisturized. If your toes are showing paint the nails with a glossy light color and make sure they are well-trimmed. 6. Decide what to do with your hair. Brush it thoroughly then comb with a thin-toothed comb. Straighten it with a heated straightener. Apply a leave-in conditioner and let it soak in. Consider curling it with a curling iron. You can wear a hairband to look cute and young.	You can curl this small section in a single curl to look cute.

Consider hiring an attorney. If you can afford a family law attorney, you should consider hiring one to help you navigate the divorce from bed and board process. See this article for directions on how to find a good family law attorney. Even if you cannot afford a full-service attorney, many attorneys provide limited services at a reasonable cost. This means you may be able to hire an attorney to prepare your documents, give you limited legal advice, or potentially even teach you about this area of the law, without having to pay the attorney to take on the entire divorce from bed and board process. 2. Locate the appropriate court. You will file your petition for custody in the same court you opened your family law case in. Generally, you will open your family law case in the county where your child lives. This is true even if you live in a different county. 3. Complete the necessary forms. In order to petition the court for full custody of your child, you will have to fill out a request for an order. This form will require you to divulge information including your request for custody and the facts supporting your request. These facts should indicate why you deserve custody of the child and how your custody request will be in the best interest of the child. * Because you are petitioning the court for full custody, you need to make sure you request both legal and physical custody. In California, this is as easy as writing your name under the headings on the form for ""legal custody"" and ""physical custody."" 4. Review your forms. Once you have filled out the required forms to request a custody hearing, you will want to review them carefully. These forms are going to be the basis of your custody argument, so you want to make sure they have been filled out accurately and completely."	For example, in California, you can contact a family law facilitator or a self-help center for assistance with these forms. If you are in California, use this link and this link for more information about those resources.

To make your own names, use the Word-Of-The-Day feature from certain websites. Usually the words are uncommon and can be suitable for names if you tweek them. 2. You can also just squash some random letters together and see if it sounds good. For example, how about Quilayi? Or maybe tweak it to Quiliya. Or even Quilane! The possibilities are endless. 3. Use a name generator. There are plenty of them out there on the web, such as www.seventhsanctum.com. 4. Try writing sites like www.lunarberry.com. A good writing site will usually have a list of names and their meanings. 5. If the above steps truly don't work for you... use spelling mistakes! Or... misspell words and write them without spaces lykkethez (like this). How about Kethez? Or Ethe? Even Ykke? 6. Pull a Rowling and arrive at a name through an anagram describing the character.	.

Use a first name as a last name. Since first and last names usually sound very different, breaking this tradition would make your character stand ever so slightly apart. (Ex. Anna Joey, Robert Gideon.) This is a very subtle approach and would make the most sense for a story that unfolds in a time and place that’s similar to your own. 2. Look for names in unexpected places. Watch the credits of a TV show or movie; a lot of uncommon names and name combinations can be found here. When you walk, bike, or drive around, take note of the street names. You might even borrow the name of a foreign city, a distant nebula, or a rare plant. Depending on what you find, this approach could be applicable to a wide variety of genres. 3. Find an unusual name in a book. Flip through the phone book or a baby name book. In particular, baby name books have lots of uncommon names and interesting spelling variations. (Have you heard of Razilee, Kadiah, Joval, Jantanie, Keryl, or Kaline?) If you want to be inspired by both a name and a character, check out a mythology book from the library; however, unless you want something obvious (ex. Athena), don’t go with Norse, Greek, or Latin mythology. 4. Strategically engineer a name from other words. J.K. Rowling, for example, is said to have created some of the names in Harry Potter by first describing a character and then creating an anagram from the descriptions. There are a number of strategies that you could use to engineer such a name. For example: * Blend common names together.	.

She will take the following steps to determine whether you have cataracts, which can affect the center (nuclear cataracts), edges (cortical cataracts) or back of the lens (posterior sub capsular cataracts). * Your optometrist will likely ask you questions about your vision, such as what symptoms you're having and how long you've experienced them. * She will perform a standard eye exam, using the familiar eye chart and viewing device that uses smaller and smaller print to test whether your vision is impaired and whether you need glasses or contacts. * Your doctor may give you a ""slit-lamp examination."" The slit refers to an intense line of light that your doctor uses with magnification to examine each section of the cornea, iris and lens for anything out of the ordinary. * When you're given a pupil dilation test, special drops are placed in your eye to dilate the pupil, making it easier for the optometrist to examine the retina, which is at the back of the eye. The doctor may use either an ophthalmoscope or slit lamp for this examination."	.

Recreate Katniss’ braid. Katniss has long black hair in the books and dark brown hair in the movies, which is about below her shoulders when braided. To get the same style, simply do a curved Dutch braid. A Dutch braid is the same as a French braid, except you are pulling pieces of hair from under rather than over. * If you want to match Katniss’ hair color, you can dye your hair with temporary dye or buy a wig. 2. Find a Mockingjay Pin. This is the pin that Katniss wears on the left side of her shirt. The pin is usually gold, but you can also find it in silver. If you don’t have one at home, try shopping online at Amazon, Toys R Us, or Walmart - you should be able to find one for $14 or much less. 3. Get a toy bow and arrows. You should be able to find these online or in a toy store for around $25, they may just need some modification.	You may also have to replace the feather's in the arrows if they're an unnatural shade.
Discipline_Your_Puppy.txt	Begin_Revision	0.915	### Reacting to Bad Behavior	2136	Or , if your dog was urinating inappropriately , pick up your puppy and immediately take him outside to the appropriate toilet spot .	### Reacting to Bad Behavior	2178	For example , if your dog was urinating inappropriately , pick up your puppy and immediately take him outside to the appropriate toilet spot .	<insert><For><1>|||<replace><Or><1><example><2>	True	"Reacting to Bad Behavior  1. Start early and be consistent. You should start disciplining your puppy as soon as you bring him home. Puppies learn quickly and should be shown what behavior is unacceptable in your house. This also means that you must be consistent when responding to bad behavior. If not, your puppy will be confused, making it harder to prevent the bad behavior. * For example, say your puppy barks at the neighbors and you command him to stop. Then, he starts barking at the postal carrier, but you say nothing. Your puppy will be unsure about when he shouldn't bark, making it likely that he'll bark whenever he feels like it. 2. Ignore bad behavior. Bad behavior is often your puppy trying to get your attention by barking, jumping up, or nipping at your fingers. Consider what reward your puppy is trying to get when engaging in bad behavior in order to determine when to ignore him. If he's jumping up on you when you come home, he probably wants your attention. Withholding your attention sends the message that he needs to act differently to get your attention. Eventually, your puppy will learn that good behavior earns your attention and affection. * You may need to step in and stop your dog's bad behavior if he's doing something destructive, like digging in the flower beds. In this case, his reward is the act of digging and possibly burying something. * For example, if your puppy starts barking at you, turn your back to him and take away any attention. He'll learn that he gets nothing from you when he behaves poorly. 3. Distract and redirect your puppy. Get your puppy's attention by making a loud noise. You might try clapping your hands and firmly saying ""no"" when you catch your puppy doing something undesirable, like chewing on your shoe or squatting to urinate on the carpet. The noise and disapproving tone will distract your puppy from the bad behavior. Redirect your puppy's attention on desirable behavior. * For example, if your puppy was chewing your shoe, remove the shoe and give him a doggy chew toy."	.

Bring over and assess what you already have. You won’t have enough to furnish your entire home, but that’s okay. You don’t need to start over from scratch. Arrange all of your old furnishings in your home, thinking about which ones are worth keeping. Try to avoid hanging onto anything broken or things you never plan on using. * Sort your items out before you move them to your new home. It may save you some money in moving expenses. You could also sell your old items for extra pocket change to put toward new furniture. * Be cautious about throwing away anything useable. That old couch may not be what you want in your new home, but it’s worth keeping if you don’t have a replacement yet. 2. Go room by room to figure out what you need to buy. Sit in each room for a few minutes. Bring a pad and paper along to write down any furnishings you can think of. Plan out each room as much as you can to keep a running list of what you need to fill the space. Don’t forget to spend time in any smaller areas you have, like foyers and hallways. * Focus on small items as well as big ones. Furniture like couches, chairs, and beds are the easiest to put on your list, but get specific. Consider features like appliances, lamps, and picture frames as well. 3. Rank your rooms by priority according to how often you use them. Aim on furnishing the most used areas of your home first. Typically, the bedroom and living room are the ones to focus on, but it depends on your home. Get the most out of these rooms by decorating them first. Break it down further by ranking the furnishings in each room by necessity. * Since you’re going to spend more time in some rooms compared to others, it makes sense to put more effort into decorating them. The side rooms can wait. Furnish them as much as possible for now and add to them over time. 4. Purchase the most essential items for your main rooms first. The items you use most frequently are the most important to have. As a starting point, look for a bed, a sofa, and a few chairs. You might already have a few of these items. In that case, move on to filling the rooms with less important items like nightstands, cabinets, and decorations. * Since the essentials are so important, buy for quality over a quantity. A good mattress with quality sheets will likely last you much longer than a cheap set that gives you back pain. You don’t need a set of uncomfortable chairs, just a few you don’t mind relaxing on. * The extra chairs help a lot for times when you have guests over. The amount you need depends on how often you have people over and how many you invite. 5. Fill in all your rooms bit by bit.	When you get a little extra spending money and stumble across something you like, get it for your home. Complete rooms with appliances, extra furniture, wall art, and anything else you can think of.

Sometimes all you need to discover your style is another set of eyes. A trainer, who has seen and worked with many styles, is invaluable if you plan on pushing your fighting further than a casual hobby. * A good trainer is one you feel comfortable with, but who still pushes you to improve and work harder. * If you're intimidated about working one-on-one, join a gym in your chosen discipline (boxing, MMA, etc.). The group setting is a great place to start working. 3. Focus on technique above all else, no matter what your style.

Learn to draw what you see. This is one of the most important steps to becoming a skilled artist. Who would want you to do a portrait of them, or a sketch of their favourite place if what you draw isn't actually what you see? Don't fret too much--loads of people make this mistake at times, and it CAN be corrected. Don't be afraid to really draw what you see. Sometimes, when you do start drawing what you see, the beginning of the sketch can look pretty awful--but it can turn out absolutely amazing. So do it. The next time you draw someone, really draw their face shape, their real nose, real eyes, real teeth. It'll take practice, but it's worth it. 2. Take out drawing instruction books from the library and surf Online for free art lessons. Many good articles and demonstrations are available Online. YouTube is full of video demonstrations and easy projects too. Most of them will at least give you ideas and may also give you tips and warnings on what supplies to purchase to learn to draw well. 3. Practice using different styles and equipment. It's all very well to be the worlds' best sketcher, but it'll be a lot more useful if you also know how to use ink, paint, and loads of other styles of drawings. There are some styles of drawings that are very spirally, and others that are more texture and tone-rather than line. You need to learn how to do all of these different branches in drawing, because you might come across one that you're especially good at. Try drawing with ink, or not actually drawing lines, but more tone. Maybe make the lines a little more spirally and curvy--or dead straight and robotic? Play around, experiment. This is a fun step. Enjoy it. 4. Learn to ""block in"" big shapes in proportion before drawing in the details or adding texture. It's okay to do this with very light, faint lines, some artists don't even erase the construction lines. Big mistakes can be caught early on with this process like getting the eyes too large or the top of the head too small before you put the work in of shading and detailing everything. 5. Learn about shading, line, tone, texture, and reflecting. This is a slightly harder step, because some of these skills are hard to master."	Learn which side light glares are on when the sun is shining that way, how adding or removing lines can completely change a drawing, how shading can make things look so much more real. Again, play around and experiment. Draw a square. Shade it from dark, gradually getting lighter. Draw a balloon or an apple-draw the light reflecting off it. Drawings can look so much more realistic and detailed when you add just a little more to them.

Look for women in places that would attract the type of woman you want to meet. It may sound like common sense, but if you do not enjoy drinking or dancing, you probably will not meet a compatible mate in a nightclub or bar. If you are shy about meeting people, or there is not a large lesbian community in your area, you might want to join a club or take a class in something that interests you, preferably one geared toward women. 2. Get involved if your city has a gay/lesbian community center. LGBT community centers usually offer various classes and activities. Pick one or a few that interest you and join in. By already knowing most of the women you will meet there are gay, you will take some of the frustration and guess-work out of trying to meet someone. Plus, if you do meet someone through a class or activity there, you will already have something in common with her to talk about and do together. 3. Get involved in online lesbian communities. The Internet is full of lesbian forums, message boards, discussion groups and blogs. Some are location-specific while others are of a more global nature. Although it is preferable to find an online group that serves your city or nearby towns, many global groups might have members from your area. 4. Join an online dating service, but before you do, make sure the dating site has local lesbian members. Many online dating sites serve the lesbian community but will not have many current members who live near you. Always browse around first to make sure the site has local active members who interest you before you commit to paying a fee for any online dating service. 5. Be open to blind dating. Although the very concept of blind dating is a turn-off to many people, keeping your options open might just allow you to meet your ideal partner. If a friend offers to set you up with someone, at least consider it before you say no. Ask a few questions about the woman, and if she sounds compatible, give it a try. If you are uncomfortable at the thought of sitting through a long date with someone you might not click with, meet for coffee.

Find out what you have. It looks like a thing with black and white keys to you, but people want to know more detail. Is it a Yamaha, Kawai, Steinway? Is it 5, 10, 100 years old? You can usually find this detail by looking the instrument over, look for names and serial numbers, this will give people a clue when they are willing to accept a donation. 2. Contact your local music store. These people know the ins and outs of music in your area. They usually know who is looking for an instrument and who accepts them. They can also be valuable when trying to understand the type of instrument that you have. 3. Contact elementary and high schools. Music programs are always struggling with budgets. One thing they always need are instruments in good repair. If you old violin can still hold a jig contact the school. Call the office and ask the secretary for contact for the head of the music department. When you contact them give as much information as possible about the instrument, they may or may not have space or use for it at the moment. 4. Contact local arts organizations. There are a lot of Community Schools, orchestras or El Sistema programs that are looking for donated instruments to be able to give to students who would otherwise not be able to play. Look up arts non-profits and charities in your area and provide them with information on the instrument. 5. Advertise online. You can go right to buy/sell/trade sites such as craigslist, kijiji or ebay.	Many of these forums has buy/sell/trade sections that you can post on. Sometimes these people are looking for an old horn or an old gem to complete their collection.

Ask your doctor for a blood type test. If your parents have different Rh factors, you can request a blood typing test. This outpatient procedure is fast and should not be very painful. You can go home afterwards. 2. Take blood typing test. A nurse or physician will clean a spot on your inner elbow or wrist with an antiseptic towelette. She will locate an easily accessible vein in this area. After wrapping a tourniquet around your upper arm to pool the blood, she will stick your vein with a needle. The needle is usually connected to a syringe, which removes your blood. Once she has taken enough blood, she will take out the needle and gently press the injection site with a sterile swab. You then will receive a bandage. Afterwards, she will label your sample and send it to a lab for testing. * Doctors test children’s blood through the back of their hands. * If you feel like you might pass out, tell the medical professional. She can help you recline. * You might feel a prick, sting, or mild pain when your nurse sticks you. After the test, you might bruise at the puncture site. This pain should not last long. 3. Test blood sample. At the laboratory, a technician will test your sample for its Rh factor. He will combine a sample of your blood with an anti-Rh serum.	On the other hand, if your blood cells do not stick together, you are Rh-.

Review the facts of your case to be certain you are truly owed money, how much and by whom. If you end up suing someone for money you claim is owed to you, you become the Plaintiff and they are labeled the Defendant. 2. Mail a letter via certified U.S. mail to the person(s) who owe you money demanding payment. You can also offer to participate in mediation, a process of negotiation where all sides state their case to an impartial mediator who then issues a judgment about who owes what to whom. 3. If you decide to pursue your rights in small claims court, familiarize yourself with your state’s laws governing small claims cases. Among other matters, those laws dictate the maximum amount that can be recovered in a small claims case. If you allege to be owed more than your state’s laws permit under its small claims laws, your case can not be filed there. 4. Determine who is/are the defendant(s) in your case. Factors impacting that include determining who signed the contract that is the basis of your claim and/or who promised to pay for the goods/services received but then failed to do so. 5. Be certain to have the defendant’s correct mailing address so your small claims complaint and accompanying documents can be properly served on the defendant. 6. Gather a complaint and accompanying documents for your case from the Internet, the clerk of the small claims court where you will file your case or from a shop that sells such documents. 7. Complete the complaint by writing a succinct and informative explanation of why you contend to be owed money. If you fill in the complaint by hand, be certain to write in clear, legible handwriting. 8. If you have any evidence to support your claim for money owed, like a signed contract, be certain to attach it to your complaint. 9. Before heading to the courthouse to file your small claims complaint, contact the clerk of courts office to determine how you can pay court costs. Some courts will only accept cash or credit cards; others will also accept personal checks.	.

Review the facts of your case to be certain you have grounds for a lawsuit. The first step in the small claims process is to evaluate your potential case. The question to ask here is whether someone owes you money and is refusing to pay. * Generally, you can bring civil cases for disputes that don’t involve a large amount of money. * If you do end up suing someone, you become the plaintiff and the person you are suing is the defendant. * There are many types of cases that are often heard in small claims court. For example, return of security deposit, or payment for broken or damaged property. Other cases involve breach of a written or verbal contract. In your case, figure out how much money you are owed and by whom. Also consider why they owe you that money. * In some counties, small claims courts review evictions and other landlord-tenant matters. If you're dealing with such issues, you'll have to find out what the laws in your area are if you are trying to evict a tenant. * Depending on the complexity of your case, you may want to consider contacting an attorney. In some states you cannot have a lawyer in small claims court. You may ask a lawyer for advice before you go to small court, though. * If you need more guidance you may contact a lawyer through your state bar association. State and county bar associations often have free referral services to qualified local attorneys. They may also offer free consultations with attorneys that specialize in the legal issues relevant to your case. 2. Mail a letter via certified mail demanding payment. A “demand letter” is a formal letter demanding monetary payment or some other action from another party. Send a demand letter to the person who owes you money. * A demand letter should explain what payment or action you are seeking. It should make it clear why you are seeking the payment or particular action. It should also specify a time limit for payment or performing the particular action. *	In some cases, just the threat of a lawsuit can cause the person you are considering suing to pay you.

Do a visual inspection. Look over your pet and see if you can find any abnormalities. These could include areas of fur that are missing or disheveled. This could also include bumps or misshapen areas on the pets body. * Doing a general visual inspection right away after you get a lost pet back will help you to figure out if your pet has a serious injury that needs immediate veterinary attention. * If you see any trauma on your pet's body, you should give care. For a laceration, cover the area with a clean cloth and then take the pet to see a veterinarian. If the trauma looks severe, such as a protruding bone, then try to stop your pet from moving and immediately take it to the closest veterinary clinic or emergency veterinary hospital. 2. Feel the pet's body. Just because you can't see a problem that doesn't mean there isn't one under your pet's fur. Feel all over its body for odd or unusual bumps. If your pet moves uncomfortably when you touch a certain area, this too can be a sign of injury. * Some pets, such as cuddly puppies, will usually be more than happy to let you feel all over their body. However, standoffish cats or crotchety old dogs may be more resistant. In cases such as these, do the best you can and then let the pet's veterinarian do a more thorough examination. 3. Watch the pet's behavior. While a pet is bound to be a little out of sorts when readjusting to home after being lost, there are some behaviors that signal ill health more than readjustment. Watch your pet after it gets home to see if its behavior is relatively normal or if there might be something wrong with it health wise. *	.
Display_Art.txt	Begin_Revision	0.946	## Steps	98	While deciding lighting for the sculpture , play around with the lights and see which effect suits you best .	### Freestanding Art	157	When deciding lighting for the sculpture , play around with the lights and see which effect suits you best .	<replace><While><1><When><1>	True	Steps  1. Do not put the artwork near severe temperature fluctuations. * Place paintings on a wall that is a dividing wall within your home rather than on the perimeter. The simple reason is that the perimeter walls are more subject to temperature fluctuations and also the possibility of water seepage. These could result in fading of pigments, cracks forming in the canvas and increased yellowing of the varnish. If you would still need to display the painting on the perimeter wall then it would be prudent to place rubber or plastic behind the frame so that the work is not in direct contact with the wall. * Displaying a painting above a fireplace will expose it to extremes in temperature and soot and is a strict no, no. The same applies to having the painting above heating and air conditioning vents. Avoid areas of high humidity like the bathroom. The kitchen is another room which should not host artworks, the steam and fumes of cooking are bound to ruin the colours over time. 2. Select a frame that complements not just the painting but also the décor of the room where it is placed. Normally smaller paintings need to be displayed with a mount. If you have a large wall, a museum style framing would help cover a larger area. A dark frame is normally advised for smaller works which help to bring the artwork into focus. For larger canvas works, keeping them on the stretcher would suffice, but they need to be checked regularly for signs of moisture or dust. 3. Have an indirect light source highlight the artworks, in the form of recessed lighting or spotlights in false ceilings. It’s a known fact that direct lighting can harm the paintings and cause the colours to fade. While the commonly used ‘picture’ lamps are popular, they cast a harsh glare which heats the painting unevenly. While using halogen lamps be aware that these emit a high level of ultraviolet light which damages artworks and hence should be installed with a UV filter. If the option is available, use tungsten lamps instead. 4. Place a sculpture so that it can be viewed from all four sides, so the placement should be such that gives an unrestricted view of the work. For large sculptures place them in the centre of a room allowing observers to move around it. IF the sculpture is made of material that is weather resistant like bronze then you could consider placing it in the garden. Smaller works should be displayed at eye level and hence a pedestal is advisable.	The play of light and shadows over a sculpture greatly enhances the way it appears. Experiment with direct overhead light or a side light source for a dramatic effect.

Developing your own film can be very fun and rewarding. And on top of that, you can save money too! 2. Before you can develop your own black and white film, you will need some supplies. All the supplies I'm about to list can be found online. My favorite web site for buying photographic supplies is http://www.freestylephoto.biz . With the exception of the chemicals, the supplies can be bought in kit form for around $50. The Arista Premium Darkroom Kit includes everything you need to get started, except for the chemicals, scissors, and bottle opener. 3. Assuming your going to use the chemicals I've listed above, the first thing you need to do is dilute the chemicals. Most photographic chemicals come in concentrate form that needs to be mixed with water. Also, different brands have different mixing ratios. Check online to find the proper chemical to water ratio for the chemicals you are using. But for this how-to, I'm going to give your ratios for the Kodak chemicals I've listed above. You are going to use the graduated cylinder to measure the chemicals and water, the gallon jugs to store them. 4. The Developer - 1:3 Chemical to water mix. That is, 1 part developer to 3 parts water. This gives you a ""stock"" solution. Fill one gallon jug with this stock solution. The stock solution will be diluted more before using it on the film. When you dilute the stock solution, you will have a ""working"" solution. 5. The Stop Bath - 1:63 Chemical to water mix. Mix the stop bath and water together and store in a gallon jug. This is a working solution. 6. The Fixer - 1:4 Chemical to water mix. Mix the fixer and water together and store in a gallon jug. This is also a working solution. 7. Hypo-Clearing Agent - Mix the full packet (4.4oz) with 1.25 gallons of water. This chemical comes as a powder and you need to ensure that it is thoroughly mixed. Store in a gallon jug. Obviously this makes more than you can store in a gallon jug, so put the extra chemical in a plastic cup or container, and use that the first time you develop film. 8. Once the chemicals have been mixed and stored in the gallon jugs, you need to bring them to the correct temperature. Fill a large sink (like your kitchen sink) with water that is 22 degrees Celsius. Use the thermometer to get the correct temperature. This is very important! Now put your gallon jugs of chemicals in the sink, floating in the water. Them chemicals must be 20 degrees Celsius when you use them. You are going to put them in 22 degree water because the temperature of the water is going to drop a bit while bringing the chemicals to the correct temperature. You really must be very accurate when it comes to the chemical temperatures. More than 1 degree above, or 1 degree below 20 degrees can have a big effect on the film. Remember, the final chemical temperature we want is 20 degrees, and we are soaking the chemicals in 22 degree water because the gallon jugs will sit in the water for at least 30 minutes, and the water temperature will drop a couple degrees during that time. 9. Now comes the only difficult part of this process. You're going to pop open the film canister, remove the film, load the film onto the film reel, and place the reel inside the developing tank. This must be in complete darkness! No light what-so-ever. No red safety lights either. Take the scissors, bottle opener, film canister, film reel, and developing tank into a dust free room that you can make light tight. For the moment you can have the room lights turned on. 10. Place the tools out in front of you, possibly on a desk. Your going to be loading the film onto the reel in complete darkness, so make sure you lay the tools out in a way that you can find them in the dark. 11. Now, turn off the lights. (Fig. 1)Use the bottle opener to pop the bottom off the film canister which should be very easy. While only touching the film negative from the edges, pull the film out of the canister. The film will be taped to the center film spool. (Fig. 2)Cut the film off of the spool. Make sure you cut it off right at the base of the spool or you'll be cutting through your pictures. Also cut the tip off the film (the odd shaped piece that sticks out of the canister when you first buy the film) so that its flat. You only need to cut about 1 inch off the tip. 12. Now its time to spool the film onto the film reel. While not touching the surface of the negative, slide the negative into the opening of of the reel. (Fig. 3)Slide about 4 inches of film into the reel. then start walking the film onto the reel by twisted one side of the reel back and forth. To be clear on this, keep your left hand steady, and with your right hand twist the right side of the reel forward, then bring it back. 13. Keep doing this until all the film is loaded onto the reel. Place the reel inside the developing tank, and screw the lid onto the tank. The tank is now light tight and you can turn on the lights. Even though the developing tank has a hole in the top for pouring in the chemicals, it is in fact light tight. 14. It's time for the fun part. Bring the developing tank to the sink where you have the chemical jugs floating in water. Check the developer chemical with the thermometer. If its at 20 degrees Celsius, then we are ready to go. If its higher than 20 degrees, then keep checking every 10 minutes until its ready. If its below 20 degrees, add some hot water to the sink the gallon jugs are floating in. Pour 1oz of the stock developing solution into the graduated cylinder, then add 7oz of 20 degrees Celsius water to that. You are making a ""working"" solution by using a 1:7 chemical to water ratio. To recap, you made a stock solution of the developing chemical by using a 1:3 chemical concentrate to water ratio, and then mixed that stock solution with a 1:7 working chemical to water ratio. 15. Now, with stop watch in hand, pour the working developer into the hole in the top of the developing tank. Do this very quickly and start the stop watch as soon as you've poured all the developer into the tank. Smack the developing tank on a counter a few times to dislodge any bubbles that might be clinging on to the film. Agitate the tank for 30 seconds. Do this by swirling the tank around. You are going to leave the film in the developer for 6 minutes. Agitate the film for 3 seconds every 30 seconds. Agitation is very important! Do not neglect to agitate the developing tank. The developing chemicals become exhausted very shortly after coming in contact with the film. The agitation ensures that fresh chemicals are touching the film."	"Over agitating can give negative results. Or positive results, it depends on the ""look"" you are going for. Too much agitation increases the contrast in the image."

If you are using different chemicals, follow the directions that come with the chemicals. 3.To develop color film, your chemicals need to be 100 degrees Fahrenheit (that's 37.8 degrees Celsius). It's important that the chemicals are not 1 degree higher or 1 degree lower than 100 degrees. To bring the chemicals in the gallon jugs to this temperature, you will have to sit the jugs in a sink filled with water. Try to bring the water in the sink temperature to about 110 degrees Fahrenheit (-43 degrees Celsius). Although you want the chemicals to be 100 degrees, the water in the sink is going to cool down very fast. 4.Pop open the film canister, remove the film, load the film onto the film reel, and place the reel inside the developing tank. This must be in complete darkness. No light whatsoever. No red safety lights either. Take the scissors, bottle opener, film canister, film reel, and developing tank into a dust free room that you can make light-tight. For the moment, you can have the room lights turned on. 5.Place the tools out in front of you, possibly on a desk. You're going to be loading the film onto the reel in complete darkness, so make sure you don't trip over something and die. Turn off the lights. (Fig. 1)Use the bottle opener to open the canister. While only touching the film negative from the edges, pull the film out of the canister. The film will be taped to the center film spool. Fig. 16. Cut the film off of the spool. (Fig. 2) Make sure you cut it off right at the base of the spool or you'll be cutting through your pictures. Also, cut the tip off the film (the odd shaped piece that sticks out of the canister when you first buy the film) so that it's flat. You only need to cut about 1 inch off the tip.

If it's below 100 degrees, add some hot water to the sink the gallon jugs are floating in. 8.With stop watch in hand, pour the working developer into the hole in the top of the developing tank. Do this very quickly and start the stop watch as soon as you've poured all the developer into the tank. Smack the developing tank on a counter a few times to dislodge any bubbles that might be clinging on to the film. Agitate the tank for 30 seconds. Do this by swirling the tank around. You are going to leave the film in the developer for 3 1/2 minutes. Agitate the film for 3 seconds every 30 seconds. Agitation is very important. Do not neglect to agitate the developing tank. The developing chemicals become exhausted very shortly after coming in contact with the film. The agitation ensures that fresh chemicals are touching the film.	"Over agitating can give negative results. Or positive results, it depends on the ""look"" you are going for. Too much agitation increases the contrast in the image."

Kill_Crepe_Myrtle.txt	Inside_Revision	0.575	### Applying Herbicide	992	If you notice your stump beginning to rot and weaken , move on to stump removal .	### Applying Herbicide	1119	Once you notice your stump beginning to rot and weaken , move on to stump removal .	<replace><If><1><Once><1>	True	Applying Herbicide  1. Spray herbicides on crepe myrtle during growing season. Crepe myrtle growing season is typically between the spring and fall. During the tree's growth phase, herbicides will translocate through the plant. Using herbicides during dormant season limits injury to site of application. * Herbicide application can come before or after cutting to the stump. But applying after is more effective, as it is more likely to reach the phloem. * During cool weather, dormant roots make it harder for the herbicide to make it way through the plant, reducing its effectiveness. * Apply the herbicide to the bottom of the crepe myrtle trunk. 2. Check your mix's sprayer compatibility if you're using a branded mix. Sprayer labels should include supported branded mixes. * When tank mixes are listed, it means that the sprayer manufacturer has researched how to effectively mix the spray. 3. Purchase mix components if you're creating your own tank mix. Purchase herbicide-mix components such as wettable powders and water dispersible granules, liquid flowables and suspensions, emulsifiable concentrate (ECs) formulations, and surfactants/solutions. Mix them together following the WALES acronym. * Wettable powders are solid pesticide formulations that are dispersed in water. Water dispersible granules are applied after they are disintegrated and dispersed in water. They take longer to disperse than wettable powders. * Emulsifiable concentrates are pesticide solutions that contain emulsifying agents in combination with a water insoluble organic solvent. * Surfactants are compounds that reduce tensions between two of the following: two liquids; a gas and a liquid; a liquid and a solid. 4. Fill your sprayer tank to three-quarters full with water. After filling it with water, add your branded herbicide mix or—if you're creating your own mix—water conditioners, buffering agents, or defoamers * Water conditioners improve the efficacy of mixes containing glyphosate and glufosinate in herbicide spray systems. * Buffering agents either facilitate herbicide activity, or facilitate or modify characteristics of a herbicide formulation. * Defoamers are added to herbicide mixes to prevent uncontrolled foaming in the spray tank. 5. Apply water-based herbicides to the phloem of your freshly cut stumps. In order for herbicides to be effective on stumps, they must reach the phloem, also known as the inner bark. When your stumps are freshly cut, this is a great time to apply herbicide. * Use water-based herbicides like glyphosate or trilopyr. * Triclopyr-based herbicides suppress growth, causing disruption that eventually kills the plant. * Keep an eye on your stump's growth. If you notice new growth, conduct a second application, as crepe myrtles are persistent. * Spray new shoots with a broadleaf herbicide. *	.

Consider your exposure to high-risk areas. Hookworm is most common in developing nations in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. Areas with poor sanitation, water treatment, and plumbing/sewage infrastructure are especially at risk. The hookworm larvae live in the soil and migrate toward the surface in search of oxygen and sunlight. Coming into contact with soil in high-risk areas — whether by hand or by walking barefoot — increases your odds of infection. Sunbathing on your back can also cause infection. * Hookworm thrives best in a moist, sandy environment. 2. Think about how you could have contracted hookworm. There are three ways to contract hookworm: through skin penetration, oral ingestion, and rarely via breast milk. If you either live in or have visited a high-risk, area, think about whether any of those modes of transmission are possible. Skin penetration is most common through the feet, but can occur anywhere on the body. * You can contract it orally by eating food prepared by an infected host or coming into contact with infected feces. Dog and cat owners, especially, can contract hookworm while handling their pets' feces. * Soil can become contaminated by pet feces, as well. Consider whether you've walked barefoot somewhere dogs or cats defecate. 3. Watch for a ""serpiginous rash."" If you have an infection type called ""cutaneous larva migrans,"" you may develop a very memorable rash. The word ""serpiginous"" shares a root with ""serpent,"" or snake. The rash has that name because you can see the hookworms moving around under the surface of the skin, like snakes. This rash migrates one to two centimeters a day, from which we get the ""migrans"" part of the name. 4. Look for mild coughing or sore throat. Once you've contracted hookworm, they find their way into your bloodstream."	This may result in a mild cough or perhaps a sore throat while the larvae continue up the airway toward the glottis. Other symptoms of this stage might include:
Invest_in_Bonds.txt	Begin_Revision	0.846	## Steps	772	Because of these fees , investors will generally obtain a higher yield by investing in individual bonds instead .	## Steps	851	As a result of these fees , investors will generally obtain a higher yield by investing in individual bonds instead .	<insert><As><1>|||<insert><a><1>|||<replace><Because><1><result><3>	True	Steps  1. Understand what a bond is. A bond is a interest-bearing certificate, issued by either government agencies (these are known as treasury bonds, agency bonds, municipal bonds, etc.) or business corporations (these are known as corporate bonds), which pays a fixed amount of interest on specified dates, usually every six months, until maturity or redemption. Treasury bonds have no risk of default (because the government controls the money printing press and can print whatever money it needs to pay the interest or principal on its bonds), while corporate bonds carry the risk of default on interest, principal, or both. * Interest payment dates (IPDs) are the dates interest is paid on the bond, typically on the 1st or 15th of the month. * Maturity is the date the bond is redeemed for its par value. A bond may be redeemed prior to maturity in accordance to the bond’s call provision. Typically, bonds can only be called at or above par, with higher premium the sooner the bond is redeemed. * Coupon rate is the percentage yield of the bond at par. For example, a bond with a par value of $1000 and a coupon rate of 12% pays $120 interest annually. * Current yield is the percentage yield of the bond at its market price. After issuance, a bond fluctuates in price on the open market according to its demand and supply and the general interest rate. For example, a bond with a par value of $1000, a coupon rate of 12%, and current market price of $800 has a current yield of 15% ($120/$800). The current yield is the most important yield figure in comparing the attractiveness of bonds of similar quality. * Yield to maturity is a complicated calculation of bond yield taking in account the bond’s eventual maturity. See How to Calculate Yield to Maturity. 2. Understand your financial needs. While bonds should be a part of almost anyone's portfolio, how much you should invest in bonds will depend on your age, risk tolerance, and circumstances. If you are in or near retirement, you might need to allocate more of your investments in favor of bonds so you can retire comfortably on steady income and preserve your capital. If you are the kind of person that can’t sleep when the stock market crashes or be tempted to sell in panic as stocks drop in price, buying treasury and investment-grade bonds and holding them to maturity may help you reduce risk. If you are saving for an important purchase, such as a home, a car, or a college education, bonds can help you build the cash you need faster than savings account or certificates of deposits can. You should invest in stocks only money that you will not need in 20 years, because over the short term, stocks fluctuate and can be down significantly when you need the money. * Before investing, consider buying a home first, if you are renting. Since everyone needs a dwelling place, it is better to secure a place to live by buying a home, to protect yourself against inflation. During periods of high interest rates, rents tend to go up every year dramatically, and may even force a renter out to live in an undesirable place. Bonds can help you build the cash you need to buy a home. 3. Learn more about bonds. Some of the best resources for bonds include: * Books: * Security Analysis, by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. * The Complete Book of Bonds, by Robert Holt. * The Bond Book, by Annette Thau. * Websites: * Investing in Bonds * Bond Funds and Income Funds * Smart Bond Investing 4. Know the different types of bonds: * Debentures, or unsecured bonds, are the most common type of taxable bonds. All corporate bonds not otherwise pledged assets or properties are debentures. * Mortgage bonds are bonds pledged specific corporate property as collateral for the bond issue. In case the bond issuer defaults on either interest or principal payment, the mortgaged property may be sold to pay the bond bearers. Due to the added security, these bonds typically have lower yield than debentures. * Ginnie Mae bonds and mortgaged-backed securities (MBS) are shares in federally backed home mortgages. As homeowners repay their mortgages, the proceeds are divided up and paid to the bond holders until the mortgage is paid off. * Senior vs. subordinate bonds: senior bonds have priority over subordinate bonds in the payment of interest and eventual redemption. This distinction is generally used only when a company runs into financial hardship which may force it into bankruptcy. * Convertible bonds are bonds that are convertible to a specified number of common shares of the same corporation. For example, a bond with a $1000 par value and a conversion price of $25 is convertible to 40 shares of the common stock. When the common stock trades above $25, the bond will trade in sync with the stock. When the common stock trades below $25, the bond is valued by its interest yield. Corporations typically issue convertible bonds to pay a lower coupon rate than nonconvertible bonds, especially when the common stock is not otherwise attractive, so the convertible bond will draw more investors into its stock. * Treasury bonds are bonds issued by the Treasury and backed by the full faith of the federal government. Because of the federal government's ability of print money, treasury bonds have no credit risk. Moreover, they are usually non-callable. Because treasury bonds are the highest quality bonds obtainable, all other bonds must offer a better yield than treasury bond with similar maturity to be worthy of consideration for investment. * Tax-free bonds, or tax-exempt bonds, or municipal bonds, are issued by cities, counties, states, and other government agency, which are free of federal taxes. These bonds are best for investors in the highest tax brackets to invest in taxable accounts. * Zero-coupon bonds defer all interest payments until maturity. They are issued at an offering price significantly below par, for example, $150-$250 when the redemption par value is $1000. Even though no interest is received, the holder of a zero-coupon bond must pay taxes on accrued interest every year. Thus, zero-coupon bonds are most suitable for retirement accounts where the bond is held to maturity. 5. Understand the inverse relationship between interest rate and bond price. Specifically, when long-term interest rate rises 10%, long-term bond prices are expected to fall by 10%; when long-term interest rate falls 10%, long-term bond prices are expected to rise by 10%. Why? Here is an example, suppose a long-term bond is issued at par $1000 when the prevailing interest rate is 5%. To be attractive as an investment-grade bond, it would have a coupon rate equal to 5%, paying $50 yearly interest. Now suppose the interest rate rises 10%, to 5.5%. Investors can now buy new issues with a coupon rate of 5.5%. To have a comparable yield, the old bond with 5% coupon rate would have to drop about 10% in price to sell at $909 to have a comparable current yield of 5.5% to be equally attractive ($50/0.055 = $909). * The lesson here is that bonds are great investments during periods of high interest rate, especially at the peak when it is about to fall, so that the investor benefits from both the higher income available and capital gains when the interest rate falls. Conversely, bonds make poor investments during periods of low interest rate, as the income is low and the bonds will fall in price as interest rate rises, giving the investor a capital loss if he decides to sell before maturity, or if the bond is called. 6. Look for reputable discount bond brokers. Most bond brokers are also stock brokers, which is okay. Consider what bond choices are available, what bond research is provided, and whether timely Quote and Sizes are available. Pay attention to both the commission and the spread. Commissions for bond purchases typically range from $1 to $4 per bond, with minimum commission about $8-30 per transaction. Spread is the difference between the ask price (the price at which you can buy) and the bid price (the price at which you can sell). For example, if the ask price for a bond is $60, while the bid price is $58, the spread is $2, which goes to the broker. Spread typically narrows with marketability of the bond. Scarce bonds tend to have wider spreads. * Other places to buy bonds: * Banks: pay attention to the fees charged. * Federal Reserve: you can buy treasuries direct through the federal reserve banks or online here: http://www.treasurydirect.gov/ 7. Locate bond offerings. Brokerages provide lists of available bonds in offering sheets, and you can search for bonds meeting certain criteria. Bond guides, stock guides, the Wall Street Journal, and the Standard & Poor’s sheet of bond issuer and prospectus are all great places to locate bonds for potential investment. 8. Check the bond ratings provided by S&P and Moody’s. These ratings are a rough measurement of a bond’s safety in both interest and principal. S&P’s ratings are AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C; the corresponding Moody’s ratings are Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, Ba, B, Caa, Ca, C. AAA is the highest rating by both services. D is sometimes used for a bond already in default, and is the lowest rating possible. NR, or no rating, is used when the bond issuer did not request a rating, insufficient information is available to make a rating, or rating is applicable to the specific type of bond involved. In general, bonds rated BB or below are junk bonds (which are deemed at risk for default). S&P modifies these ratings by assigning (+) or (-) to further rate a bond’s relative standing within each category. Moody’s adds numeric suffixes to designate these differences, such as Aa1, Aa2, Aa3. See Understanding Standard & Poor's Rating Definitions and Moody’s Investor Service Rating Symbols and Definitions for more information. * Do not rely entirely on these ratings. They are meant be used only as a rough guide to investing in bonds, and their ratings are typically slow to get updated, even after adverse corporate events have been reported. 9. Do your own bond research. Determine the type of bond, its interest payment dates and maturity date, at least three year history of the bond issuer’s interest charges versus earnings ratio or interest coverage (the higher this ratio, the more likely the issuer will be able to pay interest on its bonds, and the higher the quality of the bond), call provisions, total long term debt and debt to equity ratio, price trading ranges of the bond, current yield, yield to maturity, and any accrued interest on the bond. 10. Buy discount bonds (bonds selling below par $1000). Bonds generally sell at a discount because interest rates have gone up since the bond was issued. Given a choice between an older bond selling at a discount, and a new issue at par, both with the same current yield and quality, choose the older bond selling at a discount. The reason is that the discount serves as a call protection, because the company loses money by calling the bond and paying par value $1000 for it. Instead, if the company wishes to call the bond, it will simply buy the bond in the open market for a price below par. For this reason, never buy a bond at a premium (selling above par), because the company can choose to call the bond and you would realize an immediate capital loss equal to the premium you paid. 11. Buy convertible bonds, when the yield of convertible bonds is higher than 2% below the yield of nonconvertible bonds of equal quality. Convertible bonds offer the holder an option to convert the bond to a specific number of common shares of the same corporation at a price above the market price. For example, a company whose stock trades at $10/share may issue a bond with a 5% coupon rate, convertible for 60 shares of common stock. The conversion price of this bond would be $16.67 ($1000/60). When the common stock appreciates above the conversion price, the convertible bond will fluctuate in proportion to the stock. Because of the conversion feature, convertible bonds historically have a yield about 2% below a nonconvertible bond of equal quality. When the yield of nonconvertible bond minus the yield of convertible bond is less than 2%, it is a good time to buy convertible bonds. When the yield of nonconvertible bond minus the yield of convertible bond is higher than 2%, convertible bonds are overvalued and nonconvertible bonds are better value for the money. 12. Choose a low expense ratio bond fund to invest in junk bonds (also known as “high yield bonds”). Bond funds are investment products offered by brokerages and private corporations to make money for the fund managers, either in substantial acquisition fees (“loads”) or yearly management fees (represented by the expense ratio), or both.	The main benefit of bond funds, however, is instant diversification. A bond fund typically owns more than 100 different bonds, minimizing the effect of a few poor investments on overall portfolio returns. The benefit of diversification is useless for government bonds (which have no risk of default) and negligible for high quality corporate bonds (which have very low risk of default). The only place where bond funds are preferable to individual bonds is in the investment of junk bonds, where the default risk is high. To obtain true diversification, an investor would need at least 20 different junk bonds, which require substantial capital and commission fees. Therefore, to invest in junk bonds, it is best to choose a junk bond fund, such as SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond (JNK), with the lowest expense ratio possible.

Most people would agree that you shouldn't borrow at 3% to invest at 5%, as the increased risk in leveraging yourself is not worth the negligible payout. Investing while you still have debt is essentially the same thing. * Since treasury bonds have no risk of default, they are inherently superior in quality to all corporate bonds, and therefore offer lower yields. Agency bonds and corporate bonds must offer higher yield to compensate for the increased risk of default. For example, if a 10-year treasury bond offers 4% yield, while a 10-year corporate bond offers 5% yield, there is an implicit market assumption that the corporation has a 1% risk of default each year. If you are risk averse, or the yields on treasury bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds are comparable, or if you have no time or inclination to research corporate bonds, go with treasury bonds to protect your capital. * Bonds are ideal for an investment horizon of 5 years or less. For example, if you are saving money for a down payment to buy a house in 3 years, invest in bonds that mature in 3 years, and stay away from stocks, which are too volatile short term. * Use a limit order, instead of market order, when buying bonds, even if you are willing to buy at or above the ask price. The bid and ask prices may change before a market order reaches the exchange floor, so a limit order is always wise to prevent paying more than you expected. * Compare the yields of bonds with the dividend yields of stocks. During periods of high double digit interest rates, as happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it is possible to buy risk-free long term treasury bonds that offer double digit yields exceeding returns that can be reasonably expected from the stock market. As a rule of thumb, when interest rates on long term treasury bonds exceed the S&P 500's dividend yield by more than six percent, sell your stocks and buy bonds. *	The capital loss you realise will give you a tax benefit, and the higher yielding bonds means higher income in the long term. Obviously, this should only be done in a taxable account in order to reap the tax benefit of a capital loss, and the tax benefit must offset any trading costs involved. All securities in a tax sheltered account should be held till maturity.

Consider mediation. Courts may order mediation once custody proceedings have begun, but you can also use a mediation service to settle your custody arrangements out of court. Mediations are conducted by trained professionals who can help you and the other parent come to an agreement regarding your child’s custody. * Mediation is a neutral process. The mediator will help you and the other parent come to a decision that is in the child’s best interest. * Even if you are unable to come to an agreement in this process, mediation can help you come to an understanding of the main issues in the custody dispute. It can also help you prepare a plan for how to proceed in court, if necessary. * Many courts offer mediation counseling or referrals to trained mediators. 2. Begin looking for an attorney. Filing for sole custody is not something you want to try to handle all by yourself. You'll want to hire someone familiar with your state's custody laws to help you file the right paperwork and include information that will help you get sole custody. If you fill out the forms incorrectly or leave out important information, you might not end up with a custody agreement that meets your and your child's needs. * Ask your friends, family, and colleagues for a recommendation. It is especially helpful if these people have been in a similar situation as yours. These referrals are often useful because you can have some idea of what to expect from the attorney before you meet with them. * Look for a reputable lawyer with several years of experience in family law, especially those who have helped parents work out custody agreements. * To find an attorney in your state, call your state bar association and ask for a referral, or look online at the state bar website under the “referral” section. * Before scheduling a consultation, check with your state bar association to confirm that the attorney you’re considering is eligible to practice in your state. You will also be able to see whether they have a disciplinary record. 3. Schedule a consultation and ask questions before you hire the attorney.

You are independent from him and he got you in his power.Its important that you focus on what you like about yourself and concentrate on this.Remember everyone is unique and has something special. 5. Reward yourself with something, its nice to give something to yourself.

Get_a_Second‐Chance_Checking_Account.txt	Begin_Revision	0.691	### Deciding to Open a Second Chance Checking Account	1389	In contrast , you should consider these more legitimate options :	### Deciding to Open a Second-Chance Checking Account	1459	Instead you should consider these more legitimate options :	<delete><In><1>|||<delete><contrast><2>|||<replace><,><3><Instead><1>	True	"Deciding to Open a Second Chance Checking Account  1. Determine the reason banks are denying you a checking account. You can check with the denying institution to find out whether it based its decision on information from ChexSystems, which reports mishandled accounts and outstanding debts to its member institutions, or TeleChecks, which reports fraud and bad checks. If it used ChexSystems, you can order a copy of your report from that company to better understand, and in some cases appeal, the institution’s decision. To learn more about the process, look at how to Get a Checking Account if You're Listed in Chexsystems. You can talk to a TeleChecks representative to better understand a denial based on that company’s information. * You may also be denied an account if you have outstanding overdraft fees or if you've been a victim of identify theft. * Institutions may also use credit reports to judge your risk level and decide whether or not to give you an account. Learn how to Read a Credit Report before trying to get a second chance account. * Financial institutions that do not use ChexSystems or TeleChecks may not have a record of your former banking problems, and so are easier to obtain checking accounts from. Online, you can find directories of financial institutions that do not use these systems. * If banks continue to reject you for a regular checking account and you aren’t sure why, always ask the financial institution for details. Sometimes, banks mistakenly deny individuals. 2. Realize that you are not permanently denied a regular checking account. If you have bad credit information stored in either ChexSystems’ or TeleChecks’ database, you will eventually be able to get a checking account again if you exhibit good behavior or wait long enough. Many banks forgive former bad credit if you pay the debt and don’t have problems for 2 years. If the information in ChexSystems or TeleChecks is fraud-related, you generally have to wait up to 5 years to receive a regular checking account. * If you open a second chance account with a bank, that bank may allow you to ""upgrade"" to a regular account after a year or so if you have been a reliable customer. 3. Understand the drawbacks. Second chance bank accounts are seen as riskier to the banks that offer them. For this reason, fees are often higher with these accounts than they are with traditional accounts. In many cases, they will charge a monthly fee if you do not keep a certain balance in your account or deposit a certain amount of money each month. These thresholds are generally higher than they are for regular checking accounts. * However, you may be able to find some credit unions or banks that offer fairly good terms, like not having a minimum balance requirement. * Second chance bank account may not offer premium account features, like free checks, overdraft protection, or rewards programs. 4. Consider your other options. If you don't want to reenter the banking system yet or are unable to find a second chance checking account, you have several other options for managing your finances and paying your bills. When looking for these options, never use payday lenders or check cashing stores except as an absolute last resort. These institutions can charge very high fees or interest rates which, in the case of payday lenders, can leave you trapped in a cycle of debt if you're not careful."	.

Find the right time to approach them. You wouldn’t want to be bothered by a stranger if you were in the middle of an important conversation, would you? Try to wait until the person is unoccupied or until they finish a cell phone call. 2. Approach politely. Smile, and introduce yourself quickly. Say “excuse me,” especially if you’re butting in on a conversation, and address the person formally (use Mr., Mrs., or Ms., for example). 3. Open with a compliment. Don’t flatter a celebrity—you’ll sound phoney—but pay them a compliment. Be specific. For example, tell them you thought they were great in a certain role or that you appreciate their work for a certain charity. Don’t give a generic compliment, such as “I’m your biggest fan,” and don’t critique the person. 4. If you have something obviously in common with them, share this information. Building a rapport through similarities is a great way to get anyone talking to you. You are less likely to have a successful conversation about something you know nothing about than about something you can relate to. 5. Explain what you want. If you just want to chat and enjoy the moment, fine. If you want an autograph or picture with them, politely and quickly ask. Be prepared and ake sure you have a pen and something to autograph handy before you approach them. If they consent to give you an autograph, don’t make them wait.	.

Realize what happened and why. You have to make it clear to yourself that this is not all your fault. It takes two people to make a relationship start, and two people to have lead it to the break up. 2. Accept your pain. Have your good long cries if you feel like it. It's okay to be hurt and feel alone and feel like you have messed up. But you have to know that you are a good person and this is not all one-sided. 3. Think through everything in your head. Maybe even try to ask yourself what went wrong. But you also have to think of why you two broke up. There had to have been a reason for it all to end, right? If there was a reason but it wasn't a good one, then this person isn't worth your time. 4. Deal with the hate phase. This is where you want to just scream because you are so angry, even furious. The amount of anger you feel all depends on how bad the ""split"" was. You may even feel like you hate yourself, but get out of that feeling fast! It's a waste of time to be hating and ripping yourself apart for no reason. 5. Talk to your friends. They are always a source of advice and help. If you are close with any family members, they may be a good source of advice/guidance. You want people around you that love you and who will help you see that you should love yourself too and that you don't need this sort of pain. 6. Write all your feelings down. Write in a journal or write poems. Most of all, be absolutely honest and don't edit yourself as you go. One of the best results of writing it all down is that sometimes you will be amazed by a sudden insight that comes to you as you are pouring out your thoughts onto paper. Patterns may become clearer and as your grieving begins to lessen, you will find it so much easier to ""get"" what you're supposed to be learning from the whole experience if you've been writing your way through it. No relationship is ever a failure if you manage to learn something about yourself from having gone through it all with your heart open to both joy and pain. Just because it didn't work out doesn't mean it wasn't a necessary part of your journey to becoming who you're meant to be. 7. Keep fond memories. Sometimes there are things that remind us of another person. Say, you hear a song or see a picture that reminds you of your ex, you probably get all sad and worked up. Well, instead of feeling that way, just think of how happy that memory used to make you, and leave it at that. 8. Don't overreact. You may be feeling lonely, and want to be with someone, but don't go back to your ex unless you really believe you should be together. Likewise, don't jump into another relationship as a rebound, just to make yourself feel better. It's not fair to the other person, and will eventually lead to another breakup. 9. Find happiness in other areas of your life. Whether that means spending time with your friends and family, taking up that class you've always wanted to take, or reading every book on the New York Times bestseller list, remind yourself that there's more to life than being in a relationship. Indulge in those things. 10. Let go. See that there is no sense in still being heartbroken, regretful, and having hatred toward that person. Realize that maybe that person was your first love, but all good things have to come to an end."	.

Look for signs of self-harming or suicidal behaviors. If you suspect a friend may be self-harming or suicidal, keep an eye on them for suspicious behaviors. Self-harm can take many forms, but the most common ways people harm themselves usually involve cutting or burning their skin. * Self-harming behavior can also include biting or hitting oneself, or pulling out one’s own hair. * Suicidal behavior can include verbal statements like “I wish I were dead,” “I wish I hadn’t been born,” or “You’d all be better off without me.” 2. Ask your friend how they’re doing. Try to do this politely, without seeming judgmental or prying into your friend’s affairs. Even if your friend is initially surprised or taken aback that you’re asking about this personal topic, they’ll most likely come to appreciate that you’ve reached out to them and made an effort to help. * Try saying something like, “I know this is a personal topic to bring up, but I care about you and would hate for you to keep hurting yourself. Have you self-harmed recently, or had the urge to self-harm?” * Or say, “Hey I’ve noticed that you have some new scars on your legs; did you cut yourself? I’d like to help you; could you explain what made you hurt yourself?” 3. Suggest a few ways that you may be able to help your friend. For example, urge your friend to text or call you (or another friend or family member) whenever they experience the urge to self-harm or think of suicide. Or, suggest that they take a walk or have a snack when the impulse to self-harm or thoughts of suicide strike. * You can also help your friend by suggesting a distraction device. When they’re thinking of self-harming, urge them to take a walk, call a friend, draw a picture, or play a musical instrument. * Also ask your friends if they have any suggestions of ways you could help them. 4. Figure out if you need to tell someone about your friend’s behavior. People who self-harm or have suicidal thoughts aren’t crazy or out of control, and they’re often able to correct these behaviors on their own.	.

Get_Through_Sugar_Withdrawal.txt	Begin_Revision	0.949	## Steps	146	When you experience an intense bout of sugar cravings , try drinking a glass of water to curb the urge .	## Steps	200	Whenever you experience an intense bout of sugar cravings , try drinking a glass of water to curb the urge .	<replace><When><1><Whenever><1>	True	Steps  1. Research the nature and symptoms of sugar withdrawal. Education and preparation are your two best allies in your attempt to reduce the amount of sugar in your diet. Many individuals mistakenly believe that cutting sugar out of their diet will be a simple task that can be completed with sheer willpower. These same individuals quickly discover that sugar cravings are the simplest of the many different sugar withdrawal symptoms. * Headaches, lethargy, emotional distress, anger and even nausea can all be symptoms of sugar withdrawal. * These symptoms are not easy to ignore and cannot be eliminated through willpower alone. * By understanding these symptoms and preparing to deal with them, consumers can improve their chances of successfully reducing sugar intake. 2. Secure support from family and friends. Similar to a drug addict or alcoholic, an individual with a sugar addiction needs the help and support of family and friends. While it may sound silly, including your loved ones in your decision to eliminate sugar from your diet can do wonders in improving your chances of success. * Ask a family member or friend to attempt a sugar withdrawal diet along with you to improve your chance of success even more. * Your family and friends can help support and encourage you through the symptoms of sugar withdrawal. They can assist you by removing sugary foods from your house and by refraining from consuming sugary foods in your presence, as well as adjusting their menus when hosting you for meals. 3. Taper off your sugar intake over several weeks. One of the most common problems that many sugar addicts make is attempting to eliminate sugar from their diet all at once. This method often results in failure in just a few days. * A body that is accustomed to receiving sugar on a daily basis cannot quickly adjust to the elimination of sugar, which has served as an energy source. * Individuals who attempt to quit eating sugar all at once will experience profound and severe withdrawal symptoms. The withdrawal symptoms may manifest themselves in severe and intense cravings for sugary foods, or they may include more serious conditions such as headaches or nausea. * By gradually reducing your sugar intake over several weeks, you can greatly reduce the severity of sugar withdrawal symptoms. 4. Trick the body with sugar substitutes. If your body is craving something sweet even after you have gradually reduced the amount of sugar in your diet, you may be able to trick your body by using sugar substitutes in lieu of real sugar, although this is considered effective only as a short-term strategy. * The mind and the body are linked, and if you can convince your mind that it tastes sweetness, the body may believe that you are ingesting sugar. * Many sugar substitutes have no calories, and these substitutes can be used to deal with withdrawal symptoms without spoiling a sugar free diet. * Opt for natural sugar substitutes such as Stevia and Xylitol rather than artificial sugar substitutes. 5. Respond to cravings with physical activity. Instead of standing at the refrigerator or the pantry when a sugar craving hits you, you can respond by participating in some type of physical activity. * Exercise releases endorphins in the body, which may help to regulate the mood changes associated with sugar withdrawal symptoms. * If you are experiencing headaches or nausea because of sugar withdrawal, an exercise routine may help to boost your energy and eliminate your symptoms through increased oxygenation to the body. 6. Drink lots of water. Sometimes, people eat sugary foods when their bodies are actually craving liquid, so often, simply drinking a glass of water can stop a sugar craving. * Individuals who are addicted to high levels of sugar may have difficulty identifying the difference between a sugar craving and thirst. *	.

Before talking with him, take a few deep breaths or talk on the phone with a friend to calm yourself. * Being overly stressed may cause you to attack him, which will make him defensive. The goal of confronting him is to let him know you know and find out any relevant details that have not been revealed. 3. Say it. If you are certain he is cheating, you could say, “I have evidence that you are cheating on me.” This is more difficult to deny than asking, “Are you cheating on me?” If you are pretty sure he’s cheating, but not 100%, you could say, “I believe you are cheating on me.” This feels more declarative and firm than “I think.” Pause and let him respond. It is his job to explain himself. * If he denies an affair, present evidence that proves he’s lying, if you have it. If you do not have firm evidence, you will need to make a difficult decision about whether you can trust him to be truthful about this or not. 4. Ask about details. Gather all the information you feel you need to make a decision about the future of the relationship. Good questions might include: “How long has this been going on?” “Why did you cheat?” “Are you in love with her?” and “What does this mean for you and me?” 5. Find out his intentions. He may have cheated because he wanted to break up but was too cowardly, or he may be desperately seeking forgiveness for this terrible decision. Either way, it’s important to understand whether your boyfriend has a desire to proceed with the relationship or not. *	If you find you do want to move forward, though, you’ll need to understand if you have a willing partner or not.

Pick the right classes. This comes before getting good grades and may in fact be more important. You should pick classes that will impress graduate schools. This means choosing classes that are relevant to your subject and are high level or challenging. * Complete required courses as early as possible. Undergraduate programs typically have ""core"" requirements within majors and some graduate programs (e.g. medical school) require strict undergraduate course requirements to get in. Getting the basic requirements done in the beginning will avoid schedule conflicts later and allow you to take more advanced classes. * When choosing electives, try to create a theme. Even if you do not have an official minor or double major (which is highly recommended!) it's good to have organization to your electives. You should be able to describe how the knowledge you gained from these classes will benefit you in graduate school. Some people advise choosing directly related subjects for electives (e.g. a computer science major might take courses in mathematics) while others advise taking something very different (e.g. a computer science major might take courses in English so that you stand out from the general applicant pool. The important thing is to have good reasoning for how these courses benefited you. Having a general theme will make it easier to do this. 2. Get to know your professors. This is arguably the most important step. A good letter of recommendation can make all of the difference, and this is the step that people too often put off until it is too late. Cultivating a relationship with people in your field will help you immensely in the graduate school application process. Reaching out will likely also enrich your academic experience (and enhance your grade!). You don't have to be that kid who is always raising their hand in class (no shame in that though). * Go to each of your professor's office hours at least once. If your professor doesn't have open office hours set-up, introduce yourself at some point after class. Make sure you have something to talk about-a question about the course material, possible directions or careers in your field, or the professor's research work great. You do not have to stay the whole time, this is just so that they can know your name and face. It also gives you an opportunity to assess if this is someone you want to maintain a relationship with. If not, you don't ever have to do this again."	.
Help_a_Fallen_Fledgling.txt	Begin_Revision	0.936	### Assessing the Environment	1524	Also do n't pick up the fledgling bird and carry it to a source of water — it could easily be lost or eaten by a predator if you relocate it .	### Leaving the Fledgling Alone	1585	Finally , do n't pick up the fledgling bird and carry it to a source of water — it could easily be lost or eaten by a predator if you relocate it .	<insert><Finally><1>|||<replace><Also><1><,><2>	True	Assessing the Environment  1. Determine whether or not the bird is a fledgling. Depending on the bird’s age, it may or may not need your help. Juvenile birds fall into 3 categories: hatchlings, nestlings, and fledglings. Hatchlings and nestlings are baby birds and have no visible feathers on their wings or body. Neither hatchlings nor nestlings won’t survive for long out of the nest. Fledglings, on the other hand, have feathers and can survive on their own. * It’s very common for nestlings to be found hopping on the ground as they’re just learning to fly and forage for food. Although it’s normal to feel worried for a fledgling hopping about on the ground, the fledgling might not actually need any help at all. 2. Inspect the fledgling to determine whether it’s injured. Walk towards the fledgling until you’re less than away. Crouch down and inspect the young bird for any signs of injury. These can include a drooping wing, a broken bone, or any sign of visible blood. Also watch the bird as it moves. If it holds its wings against its sides and doesn’t show signs of pain, it’s probably not injured. * A seriously injured fledgling may have flies buzzing around or, if it’s in very bad shape, have a few maggots crawling across its body. 3. Do not give the fledgling any food or water. Although the young bird may appear small and hungry, resist the temptation to care for it and give it food. Its parents are likely nearby, and will be bringing it food from time to time. Similarly, do not try to give the bird water with cupped hands or a water dropper.	.

Know_if_You_Are_Ready_for_a_Dog.txt	Begin_Revision	0.973	## Section::::Spending Time with Your Dog.	3865	Since you have a lot of time , a puppy might be right for you ! Puppies demand a constant watchful eye for at least six months , since they are untrained and urinating every couple hours .	### Spending Time with Your Dog	4020	If you have a lot of time , a puppy might be right for you ! Puppies demand a constant watchful eye for at least six months , since they are untrained and urinating every couple hours .	<replace><Since><1><If><1>	True	"I am very busy and worry the dog wouldn't get enough attention.  1. Make sure you can meet the minimum time requirements. Commit to at least half an hour of exercise every day with your dog, plus another hour of care and play. If you are too busy to fit this in, you cannot keep a dog healthy and happy, and you should not get a dog. * Only active, undivided attention counts toward this time. Your dog will also want to spend time with you when you are doing other things around the house. * Some trainers recommend at least three and a half hours of interaction a day for the average dog. You may be able to cut corners here with extra weekend time, or by following the advice below. 2. Get a low maintenance breed. If you know you’ll be short on time, do thorough research in advance so you know what you’re getting into. The best breed for a busy owner has low exercise and social needs, only needs occasional grooming, and is easy to train. A few examples include the bull mastiff, chihuahua, and bulldog. 3. Get an adult dog. Puppies require a huge amount of time and attention, which is more than you can commit to right now. Get an adult dog instead, or even a calm senior dog. 4. Hire a dog walker. Hire a professional dog walker to stop by your house on work days, or leave your dog at ""doggy day care"". Look into an occasional dog sitter as well if your job involves regular overtime or travel. * This isn't a necessity if your dog is only alone for a few hours, but preventing it from urinating for more than eight hours risks urinary infection. Even if the dog isn't in danger of peeing, though, most dogs will be unhappy if left alone for long stretches every day. 5. Investigate training classes. This isn't a necessity, but training at home takes patience and discipline, which may be in short supply after a long workday. A professional trainer can be a major help, although the most effective classes request that the owner attend as well. Talk to local trainers and see if you can attend for just the first few sessions, or ask your household to attend in rotation. * Animal science has proven that positive reinforcement is a more effective form of training than “dominance” or “pack theory” methods. 6. Give it a trial run. The surest way to find out if you can fit a dog into your lifestyle is to try it for a few days. Consider enrolling in a foster program so you can look after a dog for a few weeks until it is ready for adoption. Alternatively, ask a friend with a dog if you could look after the pet for them for a weekend. I have some free time.  1. Commit to daily dog time. Aim for three and a half hours a day, which is a good amount of time to spend interacting with your dog. This isn't a universal rule, but the less you interact with your dog, the higher the chance of boredom or behavior problems. * An hour and a half each day is the bare minimum amount of time to spend with a dog. Even this is only appropriate for a dog with low energy and social needs, such as a calm, older dog. 2. Pick a dog that fits your lifestyle. Different dog breeds and individuals prefer different activities. Choose one that matches your own lifestyle, so you can enjoy your time together: * For indoor relaxation, choose a more sedate breed such as a greyhound or pug, or an older dog. These still need half an hour of daily exercise to stay healthy, but low-energy dogs can handle a lazy day now and then. * If you enjoy running around your neighborhood, an energetic breed such as a retriever or terrier is a great choice of companion. * Hikers should choose a fit dog at least one year old. Short-term energy isn’t enough if you’ll be trekking for several hours: pick a breed with good endurance, such as an Australian shepherd, husky, or lab retriever (with a coat suited to your climate). 3. Don't get a puppy unless someone can be home all day for the first year. Young puppies need someone on-call every hour of the day, and require an exhausting amount of care until about a year of age. If you bring home puppy, expect your free time to disappear for a while. If no one in your household is at home during the day, puppies are probably not right for you. * Young puppies need to pee as often as once every half an hour while they’re not sleeping, and cannot be fully housetrained until six months old. * Puppies love to play, but they need sleep even more (up to 20 hours a day when very young). Let them rest, and keep strenuous exercise to no more than 5 minutes per month of age, no more than twice per day. For example, a three month old puppy can handle 15 minutes of exercise, once or twice a day. 4. Make sure you have enough time for daily training. Training a dog can take as little as one or two fifteen-minute sessions a week, but you’ll need to stay disciplined 24/7 to make it effective. There’s no simple goalpost either: your dog may respond to commands well within a few weeks or months, but new behavior issues can always arise. * Introductory obedience classes are great for puppies or untrained dogs. Consider additional classes if training is advancing slowly, or if you encounter challenges you don’t know how to handle. 5. Plan around the dog’s home alone time. The more often a dog pees, the lower the risk of developing a bladder infection. Letting the dog out every four to six hours during the day is ideal. If the dog is home alone for longer than that, train it to use a pad or hire a dog walker. Give the dog lots of attention while you are around, to make up for the long stretches without socialization. * Dogs can become stressed or bored when home alone. Provide stimulating toys, and consider leaving a calm radio station on. If your dog is anxious when you leave, train the dog with “alone sessions” in another room while you are at home. 6. Adjust your social life. Do you value being able to make spontaneous plans? You might have to pass on that drink after work if you’re the dog’s main caretaker. That said, some introverts find that a friendly dog makes it easier to meet new people and start conversations. * Some of your friends may not want to visit if you have a dog, due to allergies, a phobia, or a dislike of dogs. A poorly trained or anxious dog could make it a challenge to host anyone, even dog lovers. * A dog can strain relationships within your household as well. Two common issues are disagreements on discipline and training, and unequal burden of dog care. I have lots of free time. My dog would be a constant companion.  1. Think about getting a puppy."	Basic training can take a year. Even if you have lots of time to train and dote on your puppy, you cannot predict what the adult dog will be like once it reaches mental and emotional maturity by age two or three.

Recognize and dissolve the Ego. Ego is identification with mind, emotions and forms. In other words, it's a false sense of 'self' we try to get through identification with psychological forms, people, things and conditions in our life, as a substitute for joy of being within. This is the dysfunction that most of humanity is suffering from, to varying degrees. Plus, it is so common that it's seen as normal. We are so lost in forms (mental, emotional, material) that we are unaware of our essence, the life that we are.. This disconnect from source makes you perceive yourself as an isolated fragment with fear being an inevitable consequence. It is highly recommended that you read Dissolve the Ego (According to Eckhart Tolle's Teachings) for more depth. 2. Recognize the dreamlike quality of human existence. Have you ever asked yourself that you could be in a dream right now? We, the consciousness, have been in the grip of ego for so long that we think this is our reality. Experiencing this world only through limited view of sense perceptions and thinking. Confusing? * Try this: recall something that you did or experienced in reality. Now recall something you did or experienced in a dream. When you recalled both of the scenarios, did you notice any difference in the way the images or sounds from the experiences appeared? Most probably not; contextually they were both the same. . Similarly, for a dying person, their whole life seems as if it was a dream. * Just like images and objects in a dream disappear, similarly in reality objects, people and experiences disappear as if they had never been. For example: The dinner you had last night, a conversation you had with the banker, drama from last night or week etc. All you had was memory of it. And even memory, which is a form, fades and disappears. Again, suffering arises when you seek yourself or long-lasting fulfillment in fleeting things and circumstances. Else, you will be condemned to chase after transient things, sensory pleasure and experiences, one after another, with an unconscious expectation that they will fulfill you. * Have you noticed that normal ups and downs in a dream do not affect you that much and keep you asleep? However, it's the nightmare that has the potential to wake you up. Same in reality. It's the normal ups and downs that keep you in the grip of ego, but when you face something which cannot be conceptualized and the world doesn't make sense anymore, you go through a living nightmare. That's when you have a strong motivation to wake up or get out of it. That's why suffering has a noble purpose as it has potential to crack open the shell of ego. Recognize the interconnection between inner and external world? * Space of awareness. What you are experiencing externally right now is the projection of subjective external collective world. A dance of atoms and molecules in your space of consciousness.. It's an illusion that what you are experiencing is 'outside'. Doesn't make sense? While you are dreaming your mind populates the 'space of consciousness', the substratum, with content, sounds, people, environment, etc. Like a screen in a movie theater that gets populated by a projector. This projection is a reflection of your inner state of mind. Similarly, 'in reality', it's the projection of the subjective external world through sense perceptions that populate your space of consciousness. In unenlightened state, you see reality through screen of conditioned mind, voice of the past, which has a compulsive need to react, conceptualize, analyze and label things, people and experiences. * Its cause there's a unity between the observer (you) and the observed (world). Your state of consciousness determines how you perceive the world. For example: If you believe (mental conditioning) that the world is a cold-hearted place, then that belief or paradigm will be reflected all around you and you will attract more situations and people like that.	Like when you see through a green lens, things around seem green.

Identify_Eating_Disorders_in_Teenage_Girls.txt	Begin_Revision	0.974	### Looking for Signs of an Eating Disorder	1848	While these behaviors can be healthy and are not inherently indicative of the existence of an eating disorder , you should only use them in combination with other evidence to conclude that your teenage girl has an eating disorder .	### Looking for Signs of an Eating Disorder	1917	Since these behaviors can be healthy and are not inherently indicative of the existence of an eating disorder , you should only use them in combination with other evidence to conclude that your teenage girl has an eating disorder .	<replace><While><1><Since><1>	True	Looking for Signs of an Eating Disorder  1. Look for dramatic weight changes. Weight loss is common with eating disorders, especially anorexia and bulimia. Weight may drop dramatically from the starting point, or drop below a healthy weight. Conversely, those with a binge-eating disorder will gain weight rapidly. The absence of dramatic weight change should not be taken as evidence there isn't a problem. * Eating disorders don't develop overnight. Any responsible adult should aim to identify a problem before the teen is dangerously under or over weight. Incremental changes in weight over a long period can also occur which can be hard to spot as a problem when you know the teen well. * Not every weight change is associated with an eating disorder. As teenagers grow, they may lose or gain weight. If you observe a dramatic loss of weight in conjunction with other symptoms, consider confronting the teen girl with your concerns. * When a teenage girl is 15% or more outside her normal weight, she may have an eating disorder. 2. Look for physical deterioration. Eating disorders wreak havoc on the entire body. Each eating disorder evinces different physical symptoms. Besides a marked loss of weight, individuals suffering dramatic weight loss may evince other physical symptoms, such as: * Brittle hair and nails * Dry, yellowish skin * Muscle wasting, lethargy, and general loss of energy * Being cold to the touch * An increase in body hair 3. Look for evidence of purging. Teenage girls with bulimia will expel food from their stomachs through induced vomiting (purging). If you’re a parent at home and hear or see your daughter retching, or detect the scent of vomit in the bathroom after, she may be suffering from bulimia. * If detected, she might excuse the vomiting as an illness, such as stomach flu rather than self-induced purging. If she’s sneezing, stuffy, coughing, and/or has a temperature, she’s being honest; but remember, flu isn't always accompanied by vomiting, if there's no reason for the vomiting, such as food poisoning, she may have an eating disorder. * A teen girl who purges might also take multiple showers each day in order to wash the vomit down the drain and minimize the odor. 4. Keep an eye out for laxatives or diet pills. Diet pills block the body’s absorption of fat or curb the appetite, while laxatives encourage bowel movements. Both may be employed by individuals with eating disorders in order to keep food out of their body and restrict the absorption of calories. 5. Look for extreme eating habits. A teen girl with an eating disorder may binge on a large amount of food at one time, but at other times refuse to eat for long stretches. She may eat very little, or implement very strict rules about her eating such as only eating at certain times or only eating certain types of food. Fasting or skipping meals regularly can also indicate an eating disorder. * Alternately, a girl who binges may constantly snack throughout the day and regularly consume 5,000-15,000 calories in one sitting. * If you’ve had large volumes of food go missing from the fridge, the teen may be binge-eating. 6. Watch for sudden changes in eating habits. Eating habits might change quickly and dramatically, or change slowly over time. A girl who suddenly refuses to eat anything but “diet,” fat-free, or low fat foods may have an eating disorder. Alternately, a girl who exclusively eats sweets, high-fat foods, or tries a “Cola diet” of exclusively soda may be a binge eater. * For example: If you notice she no longer eats her favorite junk food, this may be a sign that she has an eating disorder. 7. Look for an increased activity regimen. Body-image issues may manifest as a desire to reach some ideal body type through intense exercise. Perhaps she has increased her workout routine from an hour or so to three or four hours of progressively more intense exercise each day? * While regular exercise is good, if you sense the teenage girl’s exercise habits are getting out of hand and interfering with her social or academic life, consider talking with her about your concerns. 8. Look for obsessive behaviors regarding food. These may include a refusal to eat certain ingredients, measuring portions exactly, or counting calories in every item she consumes. These behaviors indicate an excessive and unhealthy preoccupation with food which could indicate an eating disorder. * If she’s taken up reading diet cookbooks, watching cooking shows on TV, or reading about new low-calorie recipes online, she might have an obsessive food disorder.	.

Try walking, jogging, and biking. Aerobic exercise is essential for singers, so get out there and put your legs and lungs to work. You should aim for 30 minutes daily, but it’s especially helpful to exercise on rehearsal days. The easiest and most affordable forms of aerobic exercise are walking, jogging, and biking. 2. Start swimming laps. If you have a nearby YMCA, community pool, or body of water, try to swim vigorously for 30 minutes. While it might take more effort and money to get to a pool or lake, swimming is the ideal form of exercise for singers. Water’s density makes your muscles do extra work, and holding your breath between strokes improves your breath control. 3. Take up yoga or a martial art. Yoga is great for singers, as it improves breath control, focus, and coordination. Tai Chi and other martial art forms can also help you develop a sense for the connections between breath, energy, and concentration. * You can look for yoga and Tai Chi videos on YouTube and other services. You could also look for a local studio and sign up for classes. * Yelling is a part of some martial art forms, so ask your instructor if you can skip the screaming to preserve your voice. 4. Stay hydrated. Drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water per day. Dehydration can wear out your vocal folds. * Cool or lukewarm water is better than ice cold water, especially right before or during rehearsal. Cold water reduces your ability to precisely control your vocal folds. 5. Quit smoking. Smoking decreases your lung capacity and damages your vocal folds (better known as vocal cords). If you smoke anything, you need to quit.	.

Don't follow the girl or walk backwards if she's walking away, despite your assertive request of asking her to stop, or after doing your spiel. Stand your ground and let her walk away. You wouldn't want to talk to someone who can't stop for a few minutes to have a conversation with you. Although its okay to walk with a girl if she genuinely seems to be in a hurry and/or asks you to walk with her. 3. Be assertive with common sense. Most girls like an assertive, commanding and leading guy. It doesn't matter how confident or independent they are. It's because of biological and evolutionary factors. A majority of the girls, especially attractive ones, most likely, will not stop or have a conversation with you unless you are dominant and assertive. So next time when a girl walks away from you, say something like, ""Hey, wait! I am talking to you"". Use the ""beckoning finger"" or the ""beckoning palm"" gesture to call her back. If you do it right, it will turn on a biological switch in her head and make her compliant. If you are not assertive enough, you will most likely lose her. * This doesn't mean you force yourself to be assertive. So use common sense and naturally calibrate as per the response from the girl."

Make a deep genuine connection. Most guys ""want"" something from girls. It could be sex, social status, physical intimacy, showing off, etc. Even if they get it, they don't feel satisfied. Why? It's because the human mind is inherently needy or insatiable. It always wants more. Read last step of How to Stop Being Needy for more insight. Here's the deeper truth: in essence, she's a human being just like you. This means they have been through similar phases of suffering and happiness, have a life story, have passions or interests, and so on. Isn't that enough to make an emotional and deep genuine connection with them? The deeper you go into it, the more you will realize that sex or physical intimacy is just a by-product of a deep emotional connection. * ""Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you."" - Tao Te Ching. * Make a habit of talking to the ""least attractive"" girls (or even guys) when you go out and genuinely practice making a deep connection with them. Not only does it help you to perceive people beyond their looks and change and dissolve your existing or pre-conceived paradigms, but it's also a practical way to get yourself in a social mood. So when you approach that hot girl you find attractive, you are already in a more fun and confident state. Plus, you can stay longer in a conversation with a less attractive girl. Here are few conversations topics that can help: passions, childhood, goals, personality, traveling, ups and downs in life, and fun things. * Keep in mind that seeing people through concepts or beliefs on the basis of their looks or background is like missing ""not so often"" opportunities to meet some genuinely cool people. This is one of the reasons you should not reject the opportunities to interact or go on dates with less attractive girls or girls who are taken. By following this practice, you may have experiences that can change your current paradigms and mindset; this puts you on a fast track that can cut down years of effort. * At the same time, be practical about it. Yes, attraction towards good-looking girls/women is a great motivator.. So it's fine to use this motivation to approach, but at the same time, be aware that the motivation is coming from attraction towards their physical looks or else you will remain stuck at that level.

Try new things. Practicing pickup as an experiment means you can try new things as test cases and just observe their outcome like a good scientist, without any emotional or mental interpretations.

Different people may have different self-limiting core beliefs that have a vast impact on their actions and personality. These beliefs are also reflected from the people around you, as the world is just a reflection of your state of consciousness.

Read How to Stay Rooted in Being for more depth on this. * ""The scientist's religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural laws, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that in comparison with it, all systematic thinking of human being is an utterly insignificant reflection. This feeling is the guiding principle of my work."" - Albert Einstein. 3. Test the validity of your self-limiting beliefs. Different people may have different self-limiting core beliefs that have a vast impact on their actions and personality. These beliefs are also reflected from the people around you, as the world is just a reflection of your state of consciousness. Suppose you have a belief that says ""They would feel threatened by me."" or ""What if I do something out of the norm?"" These beliefs or thoughts in head, would be reflected in the people around you, like a self fulfilling prophecy."	Even though, in reality, you may be a nice person. Yes, there is a possibility that they may find you threatening because of their irrational beliefs or stereotypes. This may make you perceive yourself the same way, like a mirror. Primary reality is within, so you need to be aware of these conditioned patterns in you to go beyond this loop. Read Become Mentally Flexible for more depth.

Respect your significant other's boundaries. Even if you want to be more physically affectionate, your significant other may not feel comfortable with touch. Listen to them when they tell you what they like and don't like, and when they feel physical affection is appropriate. * For example, you may like to hold hands when the two of you are out in public, but your significant other may prefer for their hands to be free. Ask if there's some other demonstration of physical affection they're more comfortable with. Perhaps they wouldn't mind if you placed your hand lightly on the small of their back, or wrapped your arm loosely around theirs. * If your significant other doesn't appreciate any physical affection, talk to them to try to understand why. Find out if they want to be more physically affectionate. You may be able to help them overcome whatever is standing in their way, and that could bring you closer together. * Pushing your significant other to accept physical touch that crosses their personal boundaries is disrespectful and will push them away from you. 2. Use small, spontaneous displays of affection. Affection isn't confined to hugs, kisses, and other physical displays. Verbal affection will also warm your partner and bring them closer to you. Let them know how much you adore them by telling them directly. * If you know your significant other has something major coming up, such as a big test at school or a presentation at work, send them a little note or text message that says something like ""You've got this! I believe in you!"" * Write little love notes and hide them around the house, or in your significant other's bag or clothing. For example, you might put a small note in their pants pocket that says ""I'm thinking about you"" or ""You always bring a small to my face."" * Let them know you appreciate the little things they do as well."	.

Get_Free_Birth_Control.txt	Begin_Revision	0.965	### Working with Your Private Insurer	1085	But , some plans do not have to provide you with free birth control and others may not have to provide this coverage until a few years from now .	### Working with Your Private Insurer	1151	However , some plans do not have to provide you with free birth control and others may not have to provide this coverage until a few years from now .	<replace><But><1><However><1>	True	"Working with Your Private Insurer  1. Check your plan to see what all your free options are. Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), most insurance companies must provide a woman with one type of free birth control from each of the 18 Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved categories. * When you call member services, the representative you are talking to may not know all of your options. Do not stop until you have a list of all your free options. * The 18 FDA-approved categories include barrier methods, like diaphragms and sponges, that you use used during sexual intercourse, hormonal methods like birth control pills and vaginal rings, implanted devices like intrauterine devices (IUDs), emergency contraception, like Plan B® and ella®, which stop ovulation after unprotected sexual intercourse, and sterilization procedures like having your tubes tied. The last category is patient education and counseling concerning the 17 different birth control methods made available to you. 2. Use your parents' health insurance. Even if you are younger than 18, the rules and regulations under ACA apply to you. But, it will be hard to prevent your parents from becoming part of the conversation if you use their insurance. * You have a right to free birth control because of ACA. You can go to a doctor, talk to her about the different birth control methods, and get a prescription. She cannot discuss any of this with your parents. But, the insurance company must provide your parents with documentation of how their benefits are being used. This is how your parents could find out you are thinking about getting birth control. Consider visiting a free clinic if you want complete confidentiality. But, it is good thing to involve a responsible adult in this important decision process. 3. Consider changing your birth control. You may be able to get free birth control if you change to the generic form of your present birth control. After talking to your doctor, you may find that free birth control in a different FDA category actually would suit you better. * Your doctor can help you make this important decision and the counselling is free because of ACA. You may try the generic form and see that it works just as well as your favorite brand-name birth control pill. If you do not like the free generic birth control pill, you may find that you actually like the equally effective and more convenient implanted device. Your insurer decides which birth control it will offer free in each category, but you can choose to fully explore your options. 4. Make your doctor your advocate. Sometimes, women like you will have a bad reaction if she does not use a particular brand-name birth control. Your doctor can make an official appeal to your insurer to have this brand provided to you free of cost. * The Department of Labor makes it clear that you can be charged a copay for a brand-name drug or device when an equivalent generic is available. However, if a “generic version is not available or would not be medically appropriate for the patient"" as determined by her doctor, ""then a plan or issuer must provide coverage for the brand name drug … without cost-sharing."" You must get your brand-name birth control for free. * In this situation, you cannot be forced to use a free birth-control method from another FDA-approved category. 5. Look for changes in approved in-network providers. Your insurance company can charge a copay if you do not use an approved pharmacy to fill your prescription or an approved healthcare provider to perform a birth control procedure like inserting an IUD. Your insurer may not fulfill its responsibility to inform you of the changes in a timely fashion. * For example, your insurer can start charging a copay on a previously free form of birth control if it now wants you purchase it from a home-delivery pharmacy instead of your local pharmacy like you had in the past. 6. Get a prescription for your over-the-counter birth control. Insurance carriers require that you have a prescription for whatever type of birth control you are using. This includes over-the-counter birth control like spermicides (kills sperms), sponges, and emergency contraception like Plan B. * This requirement is actually helpful to you. Patient education and counseling for birth control is covered by your plan free of cost. You can ask your healthcare provider questions about other forms of birth control are available to you. You can chose to stick with the over-the-counter form of birth control or change to another type that suits your needs better. 7. Change your insurance carrier if it no longer works for you. You have a right to free birth control because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)."	.

Make sure it's really what you want. Why are you aiming to go to the Ivy League? Far too many applicants apply simply because of the school name's prestige, or the pressure of overzealous parents, which is bound to lead to unhappiness.  * Research the school. Find out whether the location, social life, students, professors, climate, dormitories, food services, etc. are things you would enjoy for four years. Visit campus, talk with professors and current students. Get a sense what your life there would be like. Also, try to see if you can spend a weekend there. Several colleges offer that option. * Consider the costs of attending IL , which can be more than $50,000 per year. Plus, it rises by 6% each year. Decide whether or not having a degree from that institution will really help advance your career a lot more than attending another prestigious private school that may not be as expensive.	"The Ivy League have the deep pockets to offer generous financial aid, and of the eight Ivy League schools Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, and Princeton have need-blind and full-need admission policies. They also define ""need"" more broadly then their less wealthy peers. If your family income is less than $75,000 you won't be charged any tuition at several of the Ivies. As a group these are the wealthiest colleges and compete with each other so their financial aid offers to the neediest students involve little more than working a job at school and over the summer with no parental involvement. This would be for the neediest (Pell Grant eligible) student at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth or Columbia."

Get familiar with traditional publishing. When you go the traditional publishing route, the publisher pays you for the right to publish your work. Traditional publishers assume all costs and pay the author an advance and royalties on all sales of the work. * To get a traditional publisher, you will need to persuade a publisher to accept your work and offer you a contract. * The benefits of a traditional publisher is that they shoulder the financial risk of publishing the work, and can offer years of marketing and publicity insight and support. * Going the traditional route also provides an opportunity for the author to receive mainstream exposure and coverage in the literary community. But it is incredibly competitive in the traditional publishing world and sometimes successful DIY or self published authors can negotiate better deals with a distributor or without a publisher. 2. Be aware of how publishing through a partnership works. In a partnership publishing agreement, the author partners a literary agent, a publisher or an author collective to share the risk of publishing the work. * The author does not have to pay a fee to the partner, but usually does not get an advance. * As well, the partner will need to select the author and be able to offer marketing savvy and industry expertise to the author. * A partnership is beneficial because it is less risky than self publishing, and provides better royalties than traditional publishing. It also frees up the author from having to deal with the administrative side of publishing and focus on creative work. * Not all partners will offer the same thing to an author, so shop around and always have a legal representative look over a partnership contract before signing it. * Examples of partnership publishers includes: Rogue Reader, Diversion Books, and Cool Gus Publishing. 3. Understand how to publish through a service provider. This means the author pays upfront for a package of services and the service provider only does the work the author pays for. As well, all work is usually accepted by the service provider, as long as the author can pay for the service. * In most cases, an author makes more royalties if they go through a service provider like Author Solutions, Infinity Publishing, and Outskirts Publishing. *	So your book may be available for order through bookstores, but rarely stocked on the shelves in the store.

Become familiar with publishing through a distributor. If you publish your work through a distributor, as the author you will have to do the majority of the administrative work and promotion of the book on your own, from hiring a book designer to finding a good copy editor. You would then provide the distributor with the final files of the book and they would proceed with the publication. * However, the distributor may charge an upfront fee and/or take a cut of the sales, but they are responsible for paying the authors. * In terms of e-book publishing, or online publishing, using a distributor can save the author the headache of managing multiple retailers ( or book sellers) and doing the administrative work of publishing. The author is also not bound by a contract to the distributor, so they are not giving up their royalty rights. * Examples of distribution service providers for authors include: Smashwords (e-books), BabyBook (e-books), eBookPartnership.com, and Blurb (full color books). 5. Understand what it means to self publish. Self publishing, or DIY direct, means the author does all the work on their own, hires any outside assistance like a book designer or an editor, and provides retailers (book sellers) with finished, ready to go files or books. * Keep in mind the retailer will take a cut of the sales, but the author is not exclusive to a publisher so they can deal with each retailer on an individual basis. * Self publishing allows the author to maximize their earnings from the sale of the books, so the author gets the highest percentage of sales. The author also retains complete freedom over the work so they can adjust or edit it on the fly, and can control pricing and promotion of the book. *	Certain platforms for e-books, like Amazon and Apple, also require exclusivity or a service partner if you are going to use their services to help you self publish.

I strongly advise that you continue even if it seems pointless, after a while you will start to notice the benefits. Later on in course of activities during the reading tasks you may experience a mild ache, on one side of you head and mild fatigue this is expected don’t worry, you are just using a part of your brain you’ve never used before. If you have problems getting to sleep then this is your answer. You may also experience some vivid dreaming too don’t worry this is all to be expected. First Weeks You are required to evoke isolated sounds. This may be difficult at first but do persevere. As well as throughout the day try doing this at night when you are relaxed it seems to be easier then, due to the quietness. The idea is to try and recall sounds that cannot be represented by the internal voice. Try some of the following sounds for starters. Try to evoke as many sounds as you can. The more sounds per day the better you will become, don’t work on one sound at a time doesn’t work that way for some reason, you must try as many as you can for a little while then go on to another if the sound doesn’t come to you. · A beeping alarm. · A single note from a familiar or pleasant sounding instrument i.e. piano. · The noise of a buzzer from a familiar game show. · A crashing noise. · Smashing pans. · A door closing. · A popping sound. · Clicking buttons · Putting a cup down on a table · The high pitch screaming of a child or even a baby screaming. · Belches are good to recall for some reason! · Etc., And...

I strongly advise that you continue even if it seems pointless, after a while you will start to notice the benefits. Later on in course of activities during the reading tasks you may experience a mild ache, on one side of you head and mild fatigue this is expected don’t worry, you are just using a part of your brain you’ve never used before. If you have problems getting to sleep then this is your answer. You may also experience some vivid dreaming too don’t worry this is all to be expected. First Weeks You are required to evoke isolated sounds. This may be difficult at first but do persevere. As well as throughout the day try doing this at night when you are relaxed it seems to be easier then, due to the quietness. The idea is to try and recall sounds that cannot be represented by the internal voice. Try some of the following sounds for starters. Try to evoke as many sounds as you can. The more sounds per day the better you will become, don’t work on one sound at a time doesn’t work that way for some reason, you must try as many as you can for a little while then go on to another if the sound doesn’t come to you. · A beeping alarm. · A single note from a familiar or pleasant sounding instrument i.e. piano. · The noise of a buzzer from a familiar game show. · A crashing noise. · Smashing pans. · A door closing. · A popping sound. · Clicking buttons · Putting a cup down on a table · The high pitch screaming of a child or even a baby screaming. · Belches are good to recall for some reason! · Etc., And... Then if You Feel up to the Challenge   1. Whenever you hear an interesting noise during the day make it your task to, throughout the day recall that particular sound. Remember no voices yet. 2. Get a Dictaphone and record a sound and play it back after a few seconds. Try to recall it exactly. Imagine the sound then play it back after a few seconds. 3. Listen to snippets of classical or instrumental music then try to recall the melody or keep it in your head. You may have to listen to it again and again until you can do it, make sure you concentrate on the quality of the notes. Try and recall a few simple notes at a time will be enough to start with, no more than three or four. 4. Focus on visually recalling daily events, such as where you went for a meal whatever, try to recall some of the incidental sounds for example, the clinking sound of the serving staff placing food, footsteps or the noise of pouring a drink. Whatever the recollection you must be obsessive about recalling at least a few sounds, be as attentive to sound as you are to vision. 5. It is also advisable to take up a musical instrument, something simple. When playing, play close attention to the sound. You are required to learn scales by hearing the notes in you head and playing the correct keys on the instrument, not just to know the fingering for a particular piece. Start with parts of tunes, very few notes two or three. The exercise is not only to learn how to play music but to be attentive to sound. Practice with particular attention to sound. Practice the pronunciation of the words recalling them in another person’s voice. Don’t expect your imagination of sound to improve dramatrically immediately, It will improve gradually, eventually it will be as vivid visual imagery, which many take for granted. Sound will come as a vague impression at first and later it on it will steadily become more clear. The Next Few Weeks If you cannot fluently imagine sounds yet, then you have either gotten bored and decided to skip to the next step or you need more practice. If this is the case consider practising them for a litle longer, until you can do the tasks more fluently. If you feel that you are ready and can comfortably recall sounds then you’re ready to go on to the next step however, you should continue with the first week’s activities too. However, if you are keen to move onto this stage then don’t be disheartened if you don’t get anywhere straight away.   1. To begin with try to imagine friends and loved ones saying your name or a phrase they are known for, and try to recall voice-overs from adverts and slogans. If you don’t like someone try to hear in their voice saying something out of character. Strong emosions assist recall. These should be snippets of phrases. Familiar phrases and familiar voices will be the easiest at first. Always try to recall voices that are different from yours or voices that are very familiar to you. If the voice is similar to yours don’t bother you will probably try to recall it in your own internal voice, which we don’t want. Try to do this with as many varieties of voices as you can. It is important to be able to represent many different voices as possible this is to allow the brain to develop a clearer representation of sound. Occasionally, lock up your internal voice as described to ensure your doing it right. 2. During conversation be attentive to the quality of the voice of a speaker. If you are left out of the conversation for a little, listen in and try to hold a phrase that has been spoken then after a while try to hold another in your mind. A little later try to recall a phrase from earlier on, you will probably find you can recall it easier, since you have just been listening to that voice. 3. If a friend or celebrity is known for a particular phrase i.e. ‘That’s gotta hurt!’ imagine them saying it if you see the appropriate situation, instead of saying it in your own internal voice. 4. Again use the dictaphone and record a spoken phrase, play it back after a few seconds. Try to recall it exactly. Imagine the sound then play it back to yourself. This could lead to perfect pitch. 5. You could try turning the television right down till you can just make out what is being said. Then try to imagine what they are saying, try to recall the vague impressions of their voices. You’ll probably find this will be slightly easier than trying to recall someone’s voice cold. It will be easier with repeats of programs you have seen before! It is best to imagine no more than two or three words in succession during the early stages, you’ll build up fluency and the number of words by the time you complete this part. Try to imagine voices that are interesting e.g. squeaky, deep or even accented. To make sure you’re not using your internal voice, lock it up, if mouthing a vowel sound interrupts your sound imagination too much then you are not doing it correctly. However, if this interferes with your development, hold back on locking up the internal voice too often. Again at first a phrase will differ in clarity but eventually, it will be stable and clear. The Following few Weeks   1. Now if you have progressed to a degree of fluency this next bit should not be too difficult. Please remember to practice when you can, the previous sections. 2. Read as many notices as you can during the day. When reading notices and signs, read them then try to hear it in a familiar voice, maybe you have a favourite voice by this point. Don’t use it all the time you must imagine a whole range of voices. You may be slow at this at first and may only be able to do a few words at a time. There may be a delay for the sound image to come into your head just wait for it to come. At first you may take a few attempts to get it right, give it a few shots and practice it. After a while it will become spontaneous. Again as you get better occasionally, lock up your internal voice. 3.	Use different voices for each object; again lock the internal voice occasionally.

Choose your weapon. Get a bottle of Formula 409 or Windex or any noxious spray that will not damage the items in your house. 2. Check to make sure you have enough liquid to carry out the job. You may need five or six on-target squirts to accomplish the job, maybe even as many as twenty if you are one of the gung-ho Rambo-type fly killers. Make sure the bottle has enough spray to completely asphyxiate the fly or, failing that, drown the unfortunate victim. 3. Approach the fly. Don't approach it from the front or from the side because it will fly away. Instead, approach it from behind. Sneak up on it. (Make sure to wear your tennis shoes for two reasons: 1) to be quietly stealthy and 2) to get out of there quickly if your victim decides to turn and attack.-- Sometimes the best defense is a good offense.) 4. Spray the fly. Keep spraying until you're sure the fly is completely dead. 5. Get a paper towel, or, better yet, a couple of index cards and lift the body from its resting place, the pool of death. The deathly chemicals will need to be cleaned up as well. 6. Put the dead body outside or in the garbage. You can give it a proper burial, but it would be inappropriate to fly (chuckle) a flag at half mast (unless you were creating a YouTube video and were really into hyperbole). 7. Wash your hands. Washing your hands is important after killing a fly because flies carry disease and germs. That is about all they can carry. You did know that flies are aerodynamically amazing, right?	Nope, but they do carry germs.

Gradually trim away inches until you reach a length that makes your part look good. 2. Get a textured cut. Request that your barber or stylist trims your hair at an angle.

Talk to a counselor. A counselor who specializes in addiction can help you and other friends or family consider your options when it comes to dealing with a drug addict. Counselors are objective third-parties who have little personal stake and so can provide a much-needed outside and rational voice. In addition, counselors are trained to provide empathy, support and encouragement, which may be hard to get from other people who are concerned about the addict and are too inside the situation to see clearly, as you are. Try to find a counselor in your area or consider consulting your primary care physician for recommendations. * Alternatively, if therapy is not a good option for you, you can attend Nar-Anon meeting, which are designed to be safe spaces for the families and friends of drug addicts. * For more information on drug addiction in general, consult the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration or the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 2. Speak up. Talk to the person directly about your concerns about her drug use. Make sure the person is not using when you have this conversation. The addict may respond defensively, with excuses, denial or anger, so you should be ready to offer specific examples of behavior that has you concerned. Avoid preaching, lecturing, and moralizing and instead tell the person plainly about your worries. Once you have explained your concerns, propose immediate treatment. A promise from the person to cut back or stop the problem activity is insufficient; treatment, support, and new coping skills necessary to overcoming addiction. Explain what kind of treatment you have in mind. As with other chronic diseases, the earlier addiction is treated, the better. * Offer your love, help and support. Let the person know that you are will to accompany her to an institution, meeting or specific individual who can provide help. * Realize that the person may not agree that she needs the type of assistance that you propose. * Be prepared for this confrontation to be difficult; your friend may respond with anger, rage or indifference. Avoid responding emotionally in kind and assert again that you are trying to help them. * Remember, you are helping the person to heal. Sometimes, we need to endure the pain of a friend or loved one in order to provide them with the help she needs to get well. This is why it's called tough love - because it is not an easy way to help someone but you may be able to save someone's life. 3. Avoid emotional appeals. Upon learning about the person's addiction, your first reaction might be to convince her to stop by threatening, pleading or begging. This won't work – heroin is too strong an influence over the person's life for her to be able to stop just because you want her to. Heroin users will only stop when they are ready to. Although it might be tempting to lock the addict in a room, this isn't actually feasible and won't help them unlearn the behavior and treat the triggers that have led them to use heroin. * Keep in mind that emotional appeals could backfire in that they may only make the person feel guilty and engage in further substance abuse. * Oftentimes an individual with a long-term addiction will have to hit 'rock bottom' (a personal low point in one's life marked by desperation and hopelessness) before the person decides to quit. 4. Mean what you say. You must be careful with your own behavior and your attitude towards the addict. Be consistent and mean what you say to them; don't make empty promises or threats. For example, following through on an offer to ""Do whatever I can to help"" may be interpreted in a variety of ways. Does this mean helping the person find a local chapter of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or giving them money (which the addict could then buy drugs with)? Be very clear about your intentions to avoid confusion. The same goes for consequences. If you tell the person that next time she is caught using, she will be kicked out, you need to be prepared to follow through. * Always make sure you stick to what you say – this is the most important rule because it shows the person that you are trustworthy and that what you say holds weight. If you say you will do something for the person in return for something she has done, then do it. If she fails to do what you asked, don't do it. If you give her a warning, carry it out if she doesn't listen. * Creating and maintaining an environment of trust is of critical importance. Avoid trust-breaking behaviors, like screaming, nagging, lecturing and making promises and threats. 5. Don't enable the behavior. Break out of a cycle of dependency whereby the addict relies on you and, in turn, your assistance inadvertently helps the person keep up the addiction. If the person is a family member or friend, you'll need to think about money in particular. Decide if you are willing to lend the person money or not. Many people don’t like to lend money knowing that it will be spent on drugs, whilst others see it as stopping the addict from perhaps committing crime and getting into further trouble if she is caught. Make up your mind about this matter and stick to it. If you don't want to lend money, firmly let the person know the reasons you are unwilling and don't waver. If you are willing to lend to the person, have her sign debtor's notes for each loan and let her know that you plan to pursue any unpaid debts. If the person deso let you down, stop lending to her. * In addition, don't cover up or make excuses for the person's behavior or take over the person's responsibilities (whether they be work, family, or otherwise). Doing so shields the addict from the negative consequences of her behavior. She needs to learn that what she is doing has adverse consequences. *"	You need to keep yourself safe first and foremost.

Greet a wheelchair user the same as you would anyone. Extend your hand to shake hands. 2. Speak directly to the person who uses the wheelchair. If someone is accompanying that person (pushing the wheelchair, for example), do not talk to this companion about the person in the wheelchair - for example, ""Will he/she be needing help with..?"" to figure out how to help. That is incredibly rude and implies that the person using the wheelchair is not able to answer on his/her own. Always address him or her directly and respectfully. When you find that you are going to continue the conversation for a bit longer than you had thought, suggest you go somewhere where you can take a seat. If you can't relocate to seating area, then stand a few feet away, so that the person does not have to lift their head to look at you. 3. Keep your observations to yourself. Comments like ""Oh, that zooms so fast!"" or ""Look out, there is a speed camera in that hall"" or ""I didn't see you - does that have indicators?"" are patronising and belittling, only serving to make a mobility impaired person more not less 'different'. Don't notice the wheelchair unless you have a valid, direct question or comment. Would you make comments about speed if you were talking about someone's legs? Do you feel the need to comment on someone's glasses? See the wheelchair the same way as you see someone's glasses - a sometimes irritating but nonetheless useful tool for doing what you want and need to do, and something that is no one's business but the person using it. 4. Avoid presumptions about a person's physical abilities. You don't know what this person's physical abilities are. Just because someone is in a wheelchair it does not mean that they are paralyzed or that they are incapable of taking a few steps."	Do not test whether a person is genuinely paralyzed. If you see a person in a wheelchair moving their legs or stand up, do not question their ability or disability, and try not to act surprised.

While you may think that He must be angry at someone for whatever reason (abortion, atheism, being gay, etc.) understand that that is between Him and them. Your job is to love others. 3. Remember that prayer is about making requests, not telling God what to do. * Don't be presumptuous and think that God will give you whatever you want. * The Bible says that God will meet all of our needs, but not all of our wants. There were dozen of people that Jesus did not heal. When the Pharisees asked Jesus for a sign, he usually did not give them one. 4. Remember to stay humble when you pray. * A great verse is ""What is man that you are mindful of him?"" * Also, James 4:14 says, ""What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes."" Amen. We are nothing but dust, essentially. We are like ants compared to the magnificence of God, the creator of the world. To think of ourselves as on the same level, or even close, would be very prideful. 5. Know that sometimes God does not want to give us what we want. A big reason for this is because God might realize that the thing we want might become an idol for us. * God doesn't want us to be distracted from focusing on Him, so there are certain things he might never give us. 6. See the truth that God does not necessarily want you to be rich. * There is a popular idea out now that God wants you to be wealthy, but that concept cannot be found in the Bible. *"	"Jesus said that ""You cannot love both God and money."""

Call animal control* or hire a wildlife trapper if you fear the snake may be venomous. Snakes with venomous bites, even baby snakes, should be handled by professionals. Try to determine whether the snake you want to remove may be dangerous. (See How to Identify a Venomous Snake for a list of the most common dangerous snakes.) If you aren't sure what kind of snake it is, err on the safe side and call animal control. * Try to enclose the snake in one room. If you see it in the laundry room, for example, shut the door and wedge a towel underneath it to prevent the snake from escaping. * Keep children and pets away from the area until animal control has come to capture the snake. * If you're uncomfortable handling the snake, even if you don't believe it to be venomous, there's no reason you should deal with it yourself. Call animal control to trap it and take it away. 2. Remove a nonvenomous snake from your home yourself. The vast majority of snakes encountered by people in their homes and yards are nonvenomous. They rarely bite, and if they do, the bite won't inject poison into your body. If you feel comfortable taking care of the snake on your own, try this common removal method: * Use a broom to corral the snake onto a plastic sheet, a piece of plywood or another flat surface. * Place a trashcan or other bin over the snake. * Slide your hand under the surface the snake is sitting on and place your other hand on the base of the trashcan. * Flip the can so that the snake lands inside, and cover it with a lid. * Take the snake to the woods or another area away from your house. 3. Let the snake outside. If you find a snake in your garage or in a room leading to the outside, shut the inside doors and crack the door leading outside so the snake can crawl out. 4. Catch the snake with a glue trap. If you suspect there may be a snake in your attic, garage, basement or elsewhere in your house, lay out glue traps along the walls in these areas. Snakes crawl over the traps and get stuck. * Many areas have deemed glue traps inhumane, as animals can seriously hurt themselves or suffocate trying to escape. * Check the traps every day to see if you've caught a snake. If you wait too long, the snake will die of starvation and begin to smell. *	Pour vegetable oil over the snake to loosen it from the trap and allow it to crawl away.

They should always cooperate with the authorities but the less said about the reason for being arrested (even to you over the phone) until a lawyer arrives, the better. Anything said can be used against them in court, and having a lawyer present is essential as a defense mediation between them and the police..

Get outside. Alaska is beautiful, and nature is surrounding you. Enjoy the beauty. 2. Frolf. There are several places to play frisbee golf. It's more fun with several friends, or fellow frolf players. 3. Drop off the face of the earth. If you can spare a couple of weeks, turn off your phone and pack up your stuff. Go explore the wilderness. Camp out somewhere, and convince yourself aluminum is bad. Try bringing along instruments to play in the dead of night. Stop brushing your hair. Alaska is the perfect place to experiment with this. 4. Turn yourself into a complete hippie. Convince yourself aluminum is bad. Skip excessive hygiene, start wearing your jeans cut at the knee and recycle or resew the remaining denim. 5. Buy a small drum. Everyone in Alaska loves anyone up here beating a conga. Is it Alaskan? No. Does it remind of us a remote tropical island? Yes, and that is sort of refreshing. 6. Buy a fur coat. Alaska has superior furriers. Save it for a special occasion, or wear it in the middle of summer with a pair of shorts. 7. Take walks by yourself. Plug in your iPod, and just wander around the state thinking, fantasizing and planning. Just don't stray to far. 8. Go ski/snowboard/sled. Snow usually peaks in December/January. 9. Visit Girdwood or Seward or even Fairbanks. Girdwood is fantastic if you dig Alyeska (google it!) and it's a great place to camp. They host the July 4th Forest Fair. Seward is usually a quiet fishing town nestled at the base of Mount Marathon, but it's one heck of a party place around July Fourth. Also super crowded during that time. Fairbanks is just like Anchorage, with a relative amount of different offered leisure. Give it a shot. 10. Drink. Alaska is an acceptable place to drink ""during the day""- because are days start really early and end really late (during summer). 11. Grow a marijuana plant. According to Alaskan law, your plant can't be too large (google that also). You cannot buy, sell, or smoke it, because that goes against National law. Basically, it's a houseplant for decorative purposes only. 12. Spy on your neighbors. Buy a pair of binoculars, spot for whales, or bird watch. Don't go crazy with the ""spying"". 13. Bathe/swim outside. Nothing beats jumping into a lake/ocean or spot of cold Alaskan water. Washing off under a waterfall is completely acceptable. 14. Put your records on! Open any windows in your residence, and crank it. 15. Play at the Alaska State Fair. Go crazy. 16. Eat hot dogs. If it's summer, look around for hot dog stands. Learn the best. If it's winter, grill your own wieners indoors, or outside. Who says you can't use your grill in the winter? 17. Be a tourist. Buy all that tourist-y stuff, snap photos. Nothing feels more satisfying. 18. Exclaim to the cashier in disbelief ""I cannot believe you get fruits like bananas and pineapple up here!"" Priceless. 19. Try to find a light flashing morocco. Nothing beats using a flashing morocco to warn oncoming traffic and pedestrians that you are there! 20. Throw your bike out. Please don't try biking on icy streets. 21."

Gather your supplies. You can get a lot of natural curl in your hair by using this method, which has been around for decades. It doesn't require any chemicals or costly products, either. Pin curling is the process of wrapping small strands of hair up in a loop, and pinning them to your scalp for several hours. Here's a list of what you will need:center * Bobby pins * Mousse (optional) * Comb 2. Start with freshly-washed, damp hair. Your hair should not be dripping wet, or else it will take too long to dry. If necessary, blot your hair with a soft towel to remove excess moisture.center * If your hair is very straight or doesn't hold a curl well, you might want to put some styling mousse into it. 3. Part your hair down the center. This will make it easier to tell which direction you should be curling your hair. When working on the left side of your head, you will be wrapping your hair clockwise. When working on the right side of your head, you will be wrapping your hair counter-clockwise. This will create a uniform curl. 4. Take a 1 inch (2.54 centimeter) wide section of hair from the top of your head. It should be flat. If you make it too thick, it will take too long to dry. The bobby pin also won't hold it that well.center 5. Run a comb through the section to smooth the hairs down. You want them to be as straight as possible. Start at the roots of your hair, and move the comb down towards the ends. 6. Start rolling the hair using your finger. Place the ends against your finger, and start wrapping it around your finger, all the way to the top. 7. Pull your finger out of the curl. Be sure to still hold the curl together. 8. Secure the curl with two bobby pins.	.

Depending on the school, it might also be the right time to sign up for your first term's classes, take placement exams, register for student housing, or take care of other administrative details. 2. Arrive before classes start. If you are moving out of your parents' home to live in or near the school, you'll have a household, or at least a dorm room, to set up.

Know your providers. Not all rental car companies are created equal and it is important to understand how each are unique and how they can serve you best. Things to consider before deciding on a particular car rental company includes prices, car types available, service fees, and locations. All of these can drastically change your car rental experience. Consider which factors are most important to you, if it's price, you may need to sacrifice luxury. If its convenience, you may need to sacrifice price. If it's car model, you may need to sacrifice convenience of rental location. Certain companies are famous for adhering to particular requests, for example:center * National and Budget allow you to rent one-way while most others charge an extra fee. * Hertz and Enterprise are known for offering an extra level of service which picks you up before and drops you off after your rental which none of the other companies do. They have many locations in urban and suburban areas which is extremely convenient for people who do not have a car. 2. Search through online travel sites. This includes Orbitz, Expedia, Kayak, TravelAuto and others. The major online agencies negotiate with the car rental companies to offer competitive rates. Since they are always competing for your business, you can often get better deals that in person or over the phone. Keep in mind, like airfare, the further in advance you book the more your will save yourself money. Also, try using flexible dates to get better pricing. This also allows you to compare rates of dozens of car companies without much effort, for example:center * Orbitz is particularly good because they allow you to add discount codes to your search and get even lower rates. * The meta-search engines like Kayak and Mobissimo may help you to figure out which agent or company has the best deal in one-step. * Travelauto allows car renters to directly interact with the service provider, which helps you in getting any other additional information required.	.

Learn about autisim. In some cases, siblings of autistic people don't find out until later in their lifetime. If you have a sibling who you've only just found out is autistic but never expected it, you should first take a few weeks to get used to the fact that you are now aware that your sibling is autistic. Research what autisim is and visit web sites who can tell you how to cope with a family member with this condition. 2. Talking to them. Now that you're used to it, you now have to deal with it. In severe cases, autistic people speak gibberish (however, if this is the case with your autistic sibling, then you'll probably have known for your whole life). BUT these sort of autistic people are not stupid, however they may speak. Talk to them as if they were normal, but don't use complicated words. If your sibling is not so autistic that they appear to function normally, then it will be easier for you to talk with them. Do not yell or shout at them, because this might result in tears. Also, do not speak to them as if they were babies, this will hurt their feelings. 3. Spending time with them. This is a step made for those people who have younger autistic siblings, though sometimes it does concern those with older autistic siblings. Do what they want you to do, even if it sounds ridiculous, even embarrassing.	If your friends find out and ask what you're doing, you might have to tell them that your sibling is autistic.

Determine the type of skin biopsy you have. Your doctor may use several different methods to remove skin for a biopsy. Determining which kind of biopsy you had can help you more effectively heal the site. * A shave biopsy removes the top layers of skin, or epidermis and part of the dermis, with a tool that looks like a razor. Shave biopsies don’t usually require stitches. * A punch biopsy removes a smaller and deeper section of skin than a shave biopsy. Larger punch biopsies may need stitches. * An excisional biopsy removes a large section of abnormal skin with a scalpel. It’s common to need stitches to close an excisional biopsy site. 2. Cover the area with a bandage. Depending on the size of your biopsy site and if it continues to bleed after the procedure, your doctor may instruct you to keep the area covered with a bandage for a day or more. This will help protect the biopsy site and absorb any bleeding. * If the area bleeds, simply apply a new bandage and some light pressure. If the bleeding is heavy or continues for a protracted period, contact your doctor. 3. Leave bandages on for one day after the biopsy. For the day after your biopsy, leave on the original bandage your doctor used. Make sure to keep the bandages and area dry. This will help the site begin to heal and may keep bacteria from entering the wound. * Make sure to keep the area dry for the first day after your biopsy. You can begin to shower and clean the site the day after the procedure. 4. Change the bandages on the biopsy site daily. You should change the bandages protecting your biopsy site on a daily basis. This will help keep the area clean and dry and may prevent infection or serious scarring. * Make sure you use a bandage that will allow the biopsy site to breathe. This will allow air to flow and help heal the wound. Make sure only the nonstick prat of the bandage touches the wound. * You can get breathable bandages at most drug stores and at many grocery stores. Your doctor may also provide you with dressings for the wound. * The average time for bandage use is 5-6 days but may be as long as two weeks. * Continue to change bandages every day until you see no open wounds or your doctor instructs you to discontinue use. * Depending on the type of biopsy you had, your doctor may instruct you not to use a bandage after the first day or another amount of time. This may be the case if you had stitches. 5. Wash your hands before touching the biopsy site. Any time you touch the biopsy site or change bandages, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. This will help ensure that you don’t spread any bacteria that may infect the incision site. * You don’t need to purchase any special soap. Using any soap will work to disinfect your hands. * Make sure to scrub your hands for at least twenty seconds in warm water. 6. Keep the biopsy site clean. It’s important to keep the biopsy site clean while it is healing to help prevent infection. Washing the area daily should help keep bacteria from growing at the site. * You don’t need any special soap to clean the biopsy site. Simple soap and water will effectively disinfect the area. If the biopsy site is on your head, use shampoo to clean the site. * Make sure to rinse the biopsy site well with warm water. This will remove excess soap and not irritate the sensitive area. * If the wound is otherwise fine and not infected, simply changing the bandages and washing the site daily is sufficient to keep it clean. Your doctor may recommend that you rinse it with something like hydrogen peroxide; follow your doctor's recommendations, but don't use anything on the wound without checking first. * When you’ve finished cleaning the site, pat it dry. Then, apply an antibiotic ointment or something like petroleum jelly if you've been instructed to do so by your doctor. Ointments help keep the wound moist and reduce scab formation, helping the wound to heal.	.

These products are available from pet pharmacies, pet stores and veterinary practices. * Make sure to follow the directions on the packaging of the product you select. 2. Try a water additive. A variety of additives with anti-plaque activity are available from veterinarians and pet pharmacies. They contain low levels of anti-plaque ingredients that contact the teeth as the dog drinks. This can help keep plaque levels down. * The effectiveness of many of these products is debatable. But, some are helpful and have earned Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) approval. This means tests have found that they have anti-plaque properties. * Many of these products are safe for both dogs and cats. Carefully read the label of any product before giving it to your pets. Never let a cat drink anything labeled for dogs unless the instructions state it is safe for cats. * It is important to talk to your veterinarian before using one of these products to make sure it is right for your pet. * These products are not substitutes for brushing or professional dental care. 3. Watch what your dog eats. Sometimes, dogs develop foul breath from eating garbage, feces or other stinky substances. Do your best to prevent your pet from eating inappropriate foods and non-food items. * Make sure to clean out your dog's mouth by brushing its teeth and/ or using a rinse if it eats something unpleasant. Be sure to watch your pet for any signs of illness if your dog has eaten something it shouldn't have. If it appears sick, lethargic or behaves strangely, take your dog to a veterinarian right away. * Some commercial diets are designed to help prevent dental disease. A few have earned VOHC approval. In some cases, the kibble size and hardness are designed to shear plaque from the teeth with chewing. Others contain anti-plaque ingredients. * Dental diets are not a substitute for brushing or regular dental care.	Talk to your veterinarian about the advisability of using one of these diets.

Use automation to communicate effectively. Automation not only makes the process run faster, but it is also a a very effective way to communicate precisely with others to understand how the task or process should be executed. This is useful when working in a distributed environments where we make use of automation to solve the differences. Process automation like building software, testing, etc. eliminates human errors, configuration drifts,and communication misunderstandings which helps them focus more on feature development. 2. Do not create a separate siloed automation team. When working in a distributed environment it is easy to offshore all the automation work like test automation, infrastructure automation to other teams or countries. Most companies follow a pattern of building features and software onsite and then moving the automation work to an offshore team.	This causes a more bureaucratic silo and is eventually is followed by a blame-game of teams when an error is caused.

It can be dangerous if you do not use common sense, or if you try doing things that you shouldn't. * Don't try to use hypnosis to treat any physical or mental condition unless you are a licensed professional who is properly qualified to treat these problems. * Don't try to ""scare"" somebody into achieving their goal by dwelling on the consequences of failure. Psychological research has conclusively shown that fear is a poor way to motivate people, and the side effects usually outweigh any possible benefits. * Don't suggest anything that is against a person's morals or value systems. They will usually just come out of it. If you are going to venture down this road, get them to agree to what you are going to do before the induction. Otherwise, they may never trust you again, tell everyone what you did, take you to court, or worse. * Don't try regressing people to when they were young. If you want, tell them to 'act as if they were ten.' Some people have repressed memories which you really do not want to bring up (abuse, bullying etc.). They shut out these memories as a natural defense. Oddly, these people are often good at being hypnotized. * Don't ask a person in hypnosis to do anything you wouldn't want someone to do to you. * You can never be sure that someone is going to accept your suggestion unless you have agreed to it ahead of time or ask them ahead of time while he or she is hypnotized. * Don't get hung up on technique. * When something works dramatically well with some people, and not as well as you want it to with others, it creates a ""partial reinforcement"" effect which causes many people to try one method after another in search of the ""magic bullet"" that is going to work equally well with everyone. *"	.

Pick a cute, but sporty top. Not completely for sports, but like graphic tees, from Aeropostale and such. I provided an example. The top needs to be able to be the kind of shirt you could pull off with jeans. 2. Find sporty shorts. Shorts, not sweats. Sweats aren't cute. And all the preppy and cool girls at the private schools are doing SHORTS in spring and summer. Try going to Nike for shorts, or find similar ones.Getting them in black or navy is recommended, they match with almost anything. Also, don't get the long shorts with tiny holes in them,the kind that are sometimes see through. Denim shorts would be okay, but not preferred. If you must use denim, get cutoffs and roll them or get short ones. No longer shorts. They're not cute. 3. Shoes: Wear flip flops, or more casual low sandals or flats. If you want to nudge the sporty bar up a bit, get cute running shoes, such as Brooks, which have two colors, white and another. For maximum cuteness, get white and pink. 4. Hair: Hair is IMPORTANT. It is the main part that makes your outfit cute, not completely sporty. If you have longer hair (shoulders and down), put your hair up in either a high ponytail or a medium or high side pony. 5. Hair continued: To add to your pony, get one of those larger hair bands to keep up the hairs that fall down. Those in cute colors (pink, yellow, light blue,etc.)or those that match your hair color if you have brown or black hair are recommended (Don't get yellow if you have blond hair).I put a picture of one of those by this step. Pin the hairband down with bobby pins. 6. Hair continued: This next part for hair is optional: Bow clips. It depends if you want to be more sporty or more cute. Get these also in cute colors. If your hair band is a color that matches your hair, use any cute color for a bow.	Clip the bow on the side to back of your head.

The first and main step to achieving your leg extension is the ability to do the splits. As this is aimed at beginners, not being able to do the splits is expected and you don't have to be able to do the splits fully to get a reasonable leg extension although it does help. So, the next few steps are going to be stretches and tips to achieve your splits. If you can already do them, skip the following steps 3. To do the splits you already need to maintain some flexibility, so firstly do some simple stretches to warm up. Stand up and touch your toes, legs together, and then stand up and touch the ground with your hands flat, legs shoulder length apart. Repeat this stretch sat down with your legs straight in front of you. 4. Once you have got these stretches, it is time to start on your splits stretches. The first of which is the butterfly stretch. Sit on the ground with your knees bent outward and your feet touching. Press your elbows down on your legs and you should feel a deep stretch in your thigh. The aim is to get your legs fully on the ground but it is not expected that you will be able to because it is a very hard and advanced stretch. Once you feel pain you should keep your legs where they are and do not move them any further as it could result in serious injury. This stretch loosens the muscle in your thigh which helps in the last part of this splits so do this any chance you get. 5. Another good stretch is the lunge. Lunge forward with your front foot at an angle and your back knee to foot just above the ground.This also helps your splits greatly. Start doing these for ten seconds at a time and gradually move up to sixty. 6.	Find a piece of furniture at waist height. An extendable barre, meant for this exercise is good, but if you don't have once, sturdy furniture works just as well! Lift your leg up and place it on the furniture at waist height. This should be fairly easy as your leg is only waist high. Progress to gradually higher furniture but when you feel pain at a certain height, do not lift your leg onto furniture any higher. Keep working at the same height and eventually you will be able to lift it there without pain. Carry on like this with the ability to do the splits and you will get your leg extension with the furniture there holding it.

Prep the knobs (see specific notes in Tips section below). 2. Base the knobs with 2 - 3 coats of paint. It's best to keep paint off the bottom of the knob (the part that will go against the drawer or cabinet face) as this can cause a ridge that makes it hard to get the knob to screw in tightly. Let each coat dry thoroughly before recoating. 3. Design your knob. It's best to figure this out before you start painting. Keep it simple or go wild. Look to fabrics or wallpaper in the room for inspiration. In the beginning, keep it simple! A couple lines for a stripe, a few more for a plaid. You can base your designs on the fabrics & wallpaper in the room. Just take the original material to your local copy shop, (along with the knob for scale) and reduce or enlarge them to fit the knob. 4. Make a pattern. Trace the knob shape onto paper - then transfer your design to the traced shape. You can transfer this design to the knob after you've basecoated it by using graphite paper - or you can do it freehand. 5. Decorate your knob. Here's the fun part. If you transferred your design with the graphite paper it'll be just like those paint-by-number projects you did when you were a kid. Keep a damp sponge handy - if you don't like what you've painted, and you've let your earlier coats dry completely - you can wipe off anything you don't like. Just do it quickly. If it's dried and you're not happy, just grab some sandpaper and take it down to what you do like! 6. Varnish your knobs when you've got them just the way you like them. Use 4 - 5 coats for a kid's room.	It dries quickly, is really durable and safer for kids to be around.

Provide your hamster with chew sticks. You can throw in 1-2 chew sticks or chew toys into your hamster's cage as needed. Although these fun treats look fantastic and colorful to you, they are usually just slabs of wood brushed over with a non-toxic paint. * Packages of chew sticks generally cost $1-$10 USD, depending on what brand, quantity, and store you buy them from. * Chew sticks are often made out of balsa wood or another light-weight wood. * Make sure chews are constantly available or your hamster could face dental problems in the future, such as overgrown teeth. 2. Give your hamster untreated wood to chew on. If you are looking for a more nutritious, environmentally friendly way of keeping your hamster's teeth shaved down, you can use pesticide-free fruit tree branches. Cut off a section that is about thick and give it to your hamster. * Wood from an apple tree is best but cherry, peach, or pear wood works as well. * Try giving your hamster a piece of untreated wood that has a hole drilled in it that is at least in diameter. This will give the animal something to chew on and something to crawl through. 3. Allow your hamster to chew on a dog biscuit once a month. You can use dog biscuits as a replacement for chew sticks and wood. However, they can be very high in fat, so you should only give these in small quantities on occasion. * Consider dog biscuits a special treat that will also keep your pet healthy if eaten in moderation. 4. Make sure items you give your hamster are safe for it. Hamsters will chew on most things they are given.	Do not give them plastic to chew on. Also avoid giving them pieces of plants that are hazardous to them, including the wood of English ivy, hydrangea, and azaleas.

Get_Your_Horse_Used_to_a_Show_Atmosphere.txt	Begin_Revision	0.919	## Steps	1560	Then , join a different ring where other horses are also being ridden .	### Preparing for a class	1621	Finally , join a different ring where other horses are also being ridden .	<replace><Then><1><Finally><1>	True	Steps  1. Unload your horse and lead him directly to his stall and give him some hay. Do not put him in a strange stall until you have carefully checked it for nails and dangerous objects. Have it bedded, with a bucket of water, and a hay net before you put him in it. You may want to use a shank across his nose or under his chin as you lead him from the trailer. Also, use trailing boots. 2. Head on over to the show. Keep your horse occupied with toys and hay. If your horse starts neighing, let it slide unless it gets really serious. In this case, it may not be a good idea. Wait for a moment of calmness and stop the trailer. This shows that good things (trailer stopped) happen when he is calm. Go over to your horse, wait for calmness once again, and then pet him. If he neighs, back away. When your horse has stopped freaking out, try again. 3. Lead him around and let him get used to things after he has had some time to settle in his stall and has had a few treats and some hay. A little neighing is OK, but make him pay attention to you. Be kind and firm. He may get overexcited. Make sure to give him plenty of space, and let him see everything around him. The walk should end on a good note, meaning stop when he is behaving well if you can. 4. Try to park your trailer/van in a quieter spacey area of the park with more space if you cannot stall your horse. Do not cramp him. 5. Longe him in an area with horses around, but not in it so he feels safe, especially if you plan to ride him. When he is calm on the longe, then move him to where the horses are. Do not use a horse show as a venue to longe your horse if he is not safe on the longe at home. Remember, if you can not control your horse, you have no business taking him to a show endangering other people who paid good money to come. The longe should be no more than 20 minutes. 6. Before your class, ride in a quiet arena. Walk, trot, and canter. If your horse misbehaves uncontrollably, bring him to a walk and wait until he is calm, then hop off. Pet him a little, then try again, much, much slower. Halt. Pet him and tell him he's good. Sit up straight, and try jiggling the reins. Nudge him and gently say walk, but do not be a passenger. That means, do what you want, do not let the horse control you. If you see any improvement at the walk, try a slow trot. More improvement? Try some collection. When you succeed, slow back to a walk and try a canter.	Practice passing the other horse. Again, end on a good note.

Get rid of the negativity in your life. Put family and friends which bring too much negativity toward you on freeze for now. Don't start any trouble with them, but be less reliant on them. Also, cut back on negativity yourself! Whenever you think something negative, say to youself, ""That's negative and unneccessary."" Keep saying that to yourself until your brain stops completely. 2. Cut back on unnecessary activities to free up time. Any activity that does not produce a tangible result or lead you to success you can put on freeze. For example, cutting back on a movie or going on the computer to go on AIM half as often would suffice. But be careful about choosing which things in your life are important to you and which are not. To avoid common errors, first make a list of things (on paper!) that you normally do on a daily and/or weekly basis and put how much time you spend on each activity. Then, take the items on that list and lightly cross off the things that are useless in your life and you spend too much time on."	If it has something to do with another person, specifically family, do not cross it off as doing this could affect the other person badly. Next, look at all of the things you crossed off and then at the things you still have on your other list. Does this seem reasonable? Could you live without the things you crossed out? Our main goal is to get you to stop spending too much time on useless things.

Learn what ticks look like. Although different tick species have different characteristics, most ticks have an oval-shaped body with a small head. They're usually reddish brown, dark brown, black, or grey in color. Ticks are generally no bigger than 1/4 inch long and some species may be much smaller. Note that fully fed females can dramatically swell up to 1/2 inch in size when they're full of blood. * Unlike fleas, ticks aren't insects. They're arachnids, like spiders, so the adults have 8 legs. The younger or smallest ticks (larvae) have 6 legs. 2. Look for signs of ticks on your cat. Ticks can't jump or fly, so they crawl onto the host's body. When the tick bites your cat, it will stay firmly attached until it's done feeding. You won't be able to see the tick's head while it's feeding, which might make it hard to tell if you're looking at a tick or dark skin growth. To tell the difference, look for the tick's legs. Ticks also tend to accumulate in warm, protected areas of the body, like between the paw pads, in the ears, and armpits.	.

Dress for the occasion. The last thing you want is to be in a chic outfit that’s completely unsuited to chasing after children for two or three hours. Nor do you want to wear stilettos that may make your legs look fabulous but your feet ache an hour into your hosting duties. Choose wisely so that you look nice and well put together but also with a mind to being comfortable so that you’re not a cranky host or hostess. 2. Give yourself time to settle before the party. Try to have everything in place at least 30 minutes before the party starts. That includes yourself. This will allow you to catch a breath and be more relaxed when you welcome guests and be more prepared in case guests arrive early. Doing this will set the tone for the rest of the party, and it will be a good tone. * If you’re running behind and a guest arrives early, greet them nicely and explain you’re behind schedule. Asking if they’d help with something can help alleviate the awkwardness. * If it’s a dinner party at your home, have appetizers and drinks out and ready for guests when they arrive. 3. Greet guests warmly. You should greet each guest as he or she arrives, hopefully by name. As the host or hostess of the party, it’s your responsibility to make them feel welcome, to make them feel you’re happy they are there. Offer to take their coats, show them around if you’re able, either receive the gift or explain where to put it, say thank you for the gift, and explain the plans for the party if applicable. * Have a craft or non-competitive game or activity at children’s parties for newcomers until everyone arrives. 4. Mingle with guests. As the host or hostess of the party, it’s your job to make everyone feel comfortable during the party as well. Talk with your guests, genuinely listen to what they’re saying and respond authentically, ask them questions, introduce guests to those they don’t know, and so forth. * Don’t wait for others to generate the party’s energy. You get it going, help it sustain itself from that point forward, and enjoy yourself in so doing! * The more you put others at ease, the better the party will be. 5. Stay calm when things go wrong. Drinks will be spilled. Plates will start to pile up. The music might suddenly stop. Focus on guests, not cleanup or problems. Problems can be resolved, often much more easily than we may initially think. When accidents happen, as they will, accept apologies with a smile and take care of them. * Have stain remover on hand and create discreet places to put garbage and dirty dishes that you can deal with after the party, or hire help to assist during it. * At children’s parties, have plenty of paper towels on hand and keep your sense of humor about you! 6. Attend to guests throughout the party. Always offer guests refreshments throughout the party. If you see someone with an empty cup, offer to refill it. If you see someone standing alone, go speak with them or introduce them to someone you think they might enjoy getting to know. At children’s parties, don’t rush activities that are going well to stay on schedule. Just go with the flow for a little while until it’s really time to move on. * Monitor teens as best you can throughout the party. If you see suspicious activity, talk with the teen in private and, if need be, call the parent. 7. Avoid drinking too much alcohol. If it’s an adult party, you shouldn’t drink too much as the host or hostess of the party. Getting drunk or even a bit too tipsy can make your guests feel uncomfortable and doesn’t lend itself well to fulfilling your hosting duties. 8. Don’t use your phone unless absolutely necessary.	If a situation exists in which you need to keep your phone on vibrate and then must take a call, excuse yourself politely to take the call, keep it brief and return to your guests promptly to explain why you had to answer the call.

Gather your reins in your left hand. After checking the equipment, prepare to mount. Gather your reins and hold them firmly, but with a little slack.

Wait until the horse is completely still before you continue. * If you are at a show, or if you don’t have the time to be patient, have someone else take the reins and keep him still. In general, you are better off teaching him to stand correctly as described below, as it will greatly assist you in the future. 2. Put your foot in the stirrup. Put your weight on the stirrup, not with your arms. Your hand can use the pommel for balance, but you should not grab it tightly or pull yourself up with it. 3. Stop immediately if your horse moves.	Keep the reins short so the horse is forced to walk in a small circle. Wait until the horse stops moving, then start again. Repeat as many times as it takes to train your horse.

On the web, you can find plenty of variations of Quidditch. Try Mugglenet's official college Quodpot! * Great for a kid turning 11 or 12- going to middle school or Hogwarts. * Try a Tri-Wizard tournament. If you have a pool, you can put obstacles and challenges in there. For the dragons, you could have them case dogs with something on them they they have to get off, or for the maze, you could get some tall inflatable walls and put them in your backyard. * Do a calmed down version of the Tri-Wizard tournament! * Don't forget to write on the invite that everyone gets 20 house points to start off with. Make sure all guests understand what house points actually are. * Stick stars on the ceiling if it's okay with your parents so that your room looks like the Great Hall. * Harry Potter Trivia is an awesome way to earn house points and is a fun game. * Make Hogwarts Letters with paper stained with cooled coffee, write in green ink, and seal a fancy stained envelope with red wax. You can even listen to Harry Potter music whilst you make letters! * Dress up as your favorite Harry Potter character (Harry,Ginny,Ron etc). * Try to invite people who know a lot about Harry Potter. * Play some different Hogwarts songs at the party to set the mood. Some good bands are Swish and Flick, Draco and the Malfoys and The Parselmouths. * Why not have the yule ball? Ask your guests to bring in gorgeous clothes, do each others make-up (if you are girls) turn up the music and dance the night away! Play a mix of fast (dance) songs, slow songs and Hogwarts themed songs to have an amazing yule ball! * Make everyone a tie for the different houses and buy or make a witch or wizard hat. * Use the Hogwarts logo as an image.

Stand straight, walk with your head upright instead of bowing down (this is seen as a negative body language,so try your best to avoid it). * Be yourself. You are awesome the way you are. Don’t try to copy someone else’s style or attitude because you can’t be them and they can’t be you. Everyone is unique in his/her own way.You don’t want to be a ‘wannabe’ do you? 3. Be friendly. Smile! Say Hi to people you know, start up conversations! No one would like to talk to someone who has an inapproachable body language or someone who wouldn’t prefer being the first one to start a conversation.There are chances where people might think that you’re egoistic just because you don’t talk to them. Make friends, hang out with them and have fun! 4. Be social. Go out!

Be assertive. Know your rights and don’t let anyone fool you around.You can be quite and tolerate people’s nonsense wherever it is necessary but only upto a limit.Be brave and fight back.Seek revenge if someone constantly tries to get on your nerve.There are of course ways mentioned for dealing with that as well if you continue reading on. 9.

The saying ’Beauty is all about attitude’ is definitely true but having a fresh, gorgeous and flawless skin is equally important too, especially for teens since this is the most important time of your life for staying beautiful. Face is the first impression. Read on for some tips to have a perfect,glowing and flawless skin. * Determine your skin type and maintain it according to that. * Oily skin -This type of skin is seen to have a shiny texture,large pores and a lot of pimples. * Dry skin-skin may feel taut or show flakes of dead skin. It is associated with small pores. Moisturizing is important for this skin type. * Wash your face thrice a day: mornings,evenings and at night. Washing your face at night is the most important tip to maintain it’s smooth texture since your skin might need purification from the dirt and oil which gets accumulated in your skin because of your everyday activity.Lack of purification might cause acne,blackheads and breakouts thus making you regret for not maintaining it.Having acne is the worst nightmare for any teenager! * Drink plenty of water'. Drinking 8-10 glasses of water a day is not sufficient anymore. You should be aiming to finish a day which is upto 30 glasses.Water moisturizes your cells from underneath giving you a fresh and a glowing appearance.Drinking plenty of water is the best way to avoid acne or blackheads if you have oily skin and moisturizes dry skin as well.It is the easiest and the most natural way to maintain any skin type since it reduces your pores. * Invest in a cleanser, toner, moisturizer and facial scrub suited to your skin type. (If you're young there's no need for a facial scrub.) You might have to test out a couple of brands before you find the perfect one. Talk to an associate at a make up or skin care counter. You will be able to test different formulas. They may even offer samples so you can try a product out for a day or two. * Try to get cleanser, toner, and moisturizer that is non-comedogenic. This just means * Exfoliate. Your skin needs rejuvenation at least twice a week.Exfoliating regularly not only keeps blackheads away,but also deeply cleanses your skin and keeps you away from pores. 17. Moisturize.

Invest in a good pair of boots. Good boots are critical. They don't have to be expensive boots (though professionally fitted boots are the best). They do have to be comfortable, water resistant, durable, and properly fitted. * Running shoes or sneakers may not provide the support or stability necessary for hiking. 2. Train. The more fit you are, the more fun any given hike will be. If you're not in shape, start small. Walk around your neighborhood, climb stairs when you have an opportunity, or take shorter hikes at first. Build up from there, choosing longer, more challenging hikes. Other physical activities, such as bicycle riding, stair climbing, and jogging, can also contribute to your overall fitness level. There are many options for training, so read up, and then get out there. * Trail hiking is different than neighborhood walks on flat pavement, so make sure it is part of your regimen if you are training to hike. 3. Maintain an even cadence. Cadence is ""a recurrent rhythmical series"" of steps. Good hikers have good cadence. Their steps happen consistently at the same length and in the same amount of time. For example, good cadence might be stepping (from heel to toe) approximately 2.75 feet in every step, and taking approximately .80 seconds to take each step - and doing that consistently. * To find your cadence, find a hill, preferably paved, with a consistent slope. it does not need to be tremendously steep, but should be at least a couple hundred feet long. * With your boots on, hike the hill 2-3 times a day. Focus on one thing: stepping the same length in the same amount of time consistently. This cadence should feel natural. You don't need to take large or fast steps, just natural feeling, consistent steps. You should be able to keep your shoulders straight and back upright, with good posture. * Continue hiking this hill focusing on your cadence until you find that natural cadence. When you do, you should be able to settle into that cadence and notice that you climb the hill faster with less effort then when not settling into that cadence. You will notice that you can pass people, that are in relatively that same shape as you, with less effort than they are putting forth. 4. Take your cadence to the trail. Once keeping good cadence is easy on pavement, learn to keep that cadence on the trail. Find a relatively easy trail. A blue-circle or maybe a green-square, but definitely no black-diamonds. Hike that trail a few times a week, focusing on your cadence. *Once you get that down, find a trail with some rocks and ruts in it. Then, choose a trail that changes slope and pitch several times. Then, move to harder and harder trails until you can keep a good cadence on almost any trail. 5. Learn to use a walking stick or trekking poles."	.

Most first loves and heartbreaks occur during teen years or early 20s. You still have most of your life ahead of you to find the love of your life. * Don't find an excuse to ask them about any situation. ex. How's your mom? or Remind me again why we broke up? This will only hurt you in the end and will eventually seem like you are begging for them back. Giving them the power and you helpless waiting for his response that you will never get in return. * With maturity, your capacity to love another human being grows. Be grateful for the experience of your first love. * Remember that getting your heart broken for the first time is a fact of life. * Recognize that you have the power of choice in your life. * Don't try getting back with your ex. You broke up for a reason, even if you can't really understand that reason. * If it has been a very long time since the breakup and it's either not going away or getting worse and worse, you should probably seek help. * If you feel suicidal, seek help. Nothing in your life should push you to that point. * Don't tell him/her that you still love them. You might love them for a while longer, but remember that love is not enough and that your relationship ended for a reason. If you need to, write down the reasons. * Avoid statements like ""I'll never get over him/her."" It might seem that way, but it is short-sighted and, in the long run, not true. * Don't pretend like you are still together or think of yourselves as a couple. If people refer to him/her as your boy/girlfriend, then correct them. Even if you know that you're no longer together, saying it aloud will get the message across to yourself more strongly and help you to move on more readily. * If you know their passwords to their email/Myspace/Facebook/etc., resist the temptation to go into their accounts. It will make the pain worse. If they have your passwords, change them immediately. Also, delete them as ""friends"" on facebook. They will not be notified and you will not be tempted to stay involved in their life. It is time to forget them as best you can."	At a minimum, change your settings so you are not notified every time they update something. Sitting there looking at their recent happy pic with their new GF or BF is not going to be fun. Do not put yourself through that.

Hug someone. Even a 20-second hug with your partner, a friend, or someone you care about can boost your oxytocin level. Offer or ask for a hug for a quick pick-me-up. * Even if you’re arguing with a loved one, pausing to hug can increase feelings of trust and empathy, and maybe make your disagreement easier to handle. * Regularly hugging your partner helps you bond, and can even decrease your blood pressure and heart rate. 2. Offer affectionate touch. If hugging isn’t your thing, there are many ways to offer affectionate touch that increase your oxytocin. Hold hands with a loved one, cuddle, pet your child’s hair, kiss, or hold onto your friend’s arm while you walk. * Stand close to each other, when you can. Physical proximity increases oxytocin – which may even promote fidelity between partners. 3. Have sex. A healthy sex life often correlates with higher wellbeing and happiness for both women and men. Having sex – in a healthy, consensual environment – boosts your oxytocin level. It can help you de-stress and promote feelings of warmth and trust between you and your partner. * You may get an extra oxytocin boost if you have an orgasm, but if you don’t, it’s okay – you’ll still get the positive benefits of sex with a loving partner. 4. Spend quality time with your partner. Not all affection with your partner has to be physical to boost oxytocin. Share bonding moments together to accomplish the same thing – quality time, arousal, and wellbeing are all linked in terms of your hormones. Find a way to carve some special time out of your week to bond with your partner. * Try doing a workout together to get the added hormone boost from exercise! Go on a bike ride, a run, swim together, or go to the park and throw around a Frisbee or football. * Do a jigsaw puzzle together, or work on a crossword or Sudoku – something collaborative and stress-free. * Go on an adventure together – explore a new part of your town you’ve never been to, or take a day trip! * Do a home-improvement project together. Plant a tree, weed the garden, repaint your bedroom, or build something for your yard like a bench or birdhouse. * Prepare and share a healthy meal together. * Do something moderately stressful like riding a roller coaster or sky diving – this is a great bonding experience, and moderately stressful activities cause a spike in oxytocin. 5. Share words of encouragement with another person. Kind words may be as powerful as touch when it comes to oxytocin. Whether you are giving or receiving a compliment or words of encouragement, you get an oxytocin boost. Call up your best friend or a family member, or even express kind words to a co-worker – you’ll improve their day, and get a mood boost yourself. * Be genuine – empty words won’t accomplish anything. Dig deep and find a true, positive sentiment to express. * Spend time with friends and loved ones whenever possible, but also stay connected with those who are far away. Even loving emails, text messages, and Facebook comments help you feel supported and cared for, and boost oxytocin and mood. 6. Smile.	Smiling and laughing boost your oxytocin and can improve your overall health. If you feel terrible, fake it! Often the hormone boost will turn your fake smile into a real one.

Lower your stress levels. Take a yoga class, plan a relaxing date night each week, or create relaxing routines, such as taking a bubble bath after work. Chronic stress can push you toward dementia and other brain disorders, so relaxing can go a long way towards improving cognitive performance. 2. Create social connections to maintain a positive outlook. Invite coworkers out for social activities. Participate in social clubs to meet new people. Try to talk with people whenever you go out instead of staying focused on your phone. Every time we make positive human contact our brains experience an uptick in good chemicals, such as endorphins. Be social and your brain will thank you! 3. Meditate and practice reflection. Take a formal meditation class at a yoga studio or recreation center near you. Or, go online and watch tutorials on how to enter a meditative state of mind. Spend at least 15 minutes each day mediating or reflecting. You can even sit in bed at night, clear your mind, and think about the day’s events. This gives your brain a jumpstart on its work once you go to sleep. * To enter a meditative state, you might need to repeat a word or phrase, such as, “relax,” or “reflect.” Try to mediate in an area where you will be undisturbed and can try to slide into a semi-conscious frame of mind. * You can, of course, meditate for longer than 15 minutes if you like. 4. Establish routines for simple tasks. For things that you do every day, try to establish pattern of how to behave or what to do and stick with it.	Taking away any decision-making in simple scenarios like this frees up your brainpower to tackle more complex problems.

Be sure you take the proper dosage as indicated on the package, and call your doctor if the fever is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher or lasts for more than three days. * For a lower grade fever, try wearing thinner pajamas, using only bed sheets instead of blankets, or even sleeping in the nude if that's more comfortable. You can also go to bed with damp hair or use a damp rag on your forehead or neck while you sleep, as long as you don't feel overly chilled. 2. Address a cough. Coughing fits are extremely disruptive to sleep. Try elevating your body with a few extra pillows at bedtime, and try to sleep on your side to prevent fluids from pooling in your lungs. * Try taking a spoonful of honey to coat your throat before you sleep. You can also drink tea with honey to reduce the urge to cough as you fall asleep. * If your cough is productive, meaning that you cough up phlegm, try taking a medicine to dislodge some of the mucus about an hour or so before bed. These products are labeled ""expectorant"" because they cause you to spit out the mucus. * You can also try using a cough suppressant or a soothing ointment like Vicks Vaporub. 3. Deal with body aches at bedtime. It can be very difficult to fall asleep if your body is aching, whether it is from the flu, an injury, or an infection. Calming the ache can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. * Take an over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen thirty minutes before bedtime. * If the pain continues, put a hot water bottle over most of the aching parts. Most heating pads also have timed off switches so they are fairly safe to use at bedtime. 4. Treat a sore throat at bedtime. Falling asleep with a sore throat can be particularly difficult, since these seem to intensify at bedtime. * Before bed, drink a hot herbal tea made with lemon and honey. You can use any herbal tea like chamomile or raspberry, or create your own by simply steeping slices of lemon in hot water and adding a teaspoon or two of honey. The heat itself will help relieve your throat, so the type of tea doesn't matter as long as it is not caffeinated. * First, take a long-lasting pain reliever like ibuprofen about thirty minutes before bedtime. Then, when it is time to lay down, try using a numbing spray like Chloraseptic or Cepacol. These will temporarily numb the pain so you can fall asleep. * Have a glass of water by your bedside to keep hydrated. Ensure you drink each time you may wake during the night. Cuddle a teddy or heat pack to distract you. Use honey to coat your throat. 5. Take steps to alleviate nausea and upset stomach. Symptoms like gas, bloating, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea can keep you up all night. Take some medicine before bed, like Pepto Bismol, and try to get comfortable. * For nausea, you can also try sipping a tea made with ginger. If you have fresh ginger and lemon available, slice them and put them in a cup of boiling water to steep for five minutes. Add a bit of honey and sip this slowly before bed. The ginger and lemon will help to settle your stomach. * Sleep with your body curled around a heating pad, if you have one. If you don't, fill a tube sock with dry, raw corn or rice and tie the end securely. Heat this in the microwave for a minute; the grain will hold the heat and act as a heating pad. 6. Address a runny or congested nose."	Try these strategies at bedtime:

Go to school. You should do your best to be at school every day. If you are not in school, you’ll miss important information, won’t be able to turn in your homework, and will fall behind. Trying to catch up can be stressful, and you probably won’t do as well as you want to when trying to do lots of work very quickly. * If you miss the bus, or are late for some other reason, make sure you get to school as soon as you can. Being late is better than not showing up. * If you are sick, though, it is better not to go to school. Not only will it make it harder for you to concentrate and learn, but you might also pass it on to your classmates, making them sick too. This means being actually sick, not just “not feeling well.” If you are able to get up and move around at home without too much difficulty, you are probably well enough to go to school. If you are throwing up, have diarrhea, or a disease like pinkeye or strep throat, your parents should make you stay at home. 2. Sit up front. This can be tough in some parts of elementary school because you have assigned seating.	You’ll be closer to the teacher, more engaged in what she is talking about, and you’ll remember more information.

Stay out of a cat's way, when their engine is fired-up; and hope that their brake pads are good. 2. Do you find yourself sitting in the middle of the sofa, while one of your cats is laying in your favorite place to sit? If so, chances are your cat is spoiled, especially, if you try to reclaim your spot and he or she isn't moving...instead they fuss you for the annoying idea of moving them. If you look over and your cat has a very pleasing look on it's face, well that's the cat's sense of humor showing. What you need is an extra sofa, or sweet talk the cat in to moving. 3. Do you go to fluff-up your pillow, during the night, and an angry cat swats you and meows, like why are you distrubing me? Then, you find yourself sliding further down in the bed, and your head ends-up on the matress, while the cat continues to sleep quite nicely. Well, chances are that your cat is spoiled, and very well may find that taking over your pillow is quite humorous. My suggestion is get you an extra pillow...and have it on top of the cat's pillow...slide it forward, so that the cat's pillow is in clear sight. Let the cat know, which pillow is yours, and which is their's, put the cat on it's pillow. 4. Do you find yourself feeding the cat, before eating yourself? But, yet, when that you sit-down to eat they are right there, checking-out your dinner plate, like what's new for dinner? However, when that they see that you Do Not plan to share your meal, they'll eat their cat food. Nevertheless, they are not very happy about it, nor with you. Their sense of humor, suddenly, took a ""nose dive,"" so to speak. Well, just continue to enjoy your meal, they'll get over it, or get you back. 5. Do you ever try to read the newspaper or a magazine and your cat comes over and lies down on top of it? The cat is wanting you to stop what that you are doing and pet them. And, you're like, oh well, I'll read it later, after the cat or cats are asleep. The trouble with that idea is that they just cat nap, and then, are back-up for more petting. So, by the time that you read the newspaper it is old news, and the magazine is a back issue. However, your cat or cats are happy that's the good news. You can always go to the park, or a restaurant to catch-up on your reading. 6. Have you ever bought your spouse a greeting card and a ballon, such as for Valentine's Day? And, your cat ends-up punchering the balloon, with their very sharp teeth, and tears-up the card. Well, maybe you should have gotten the cat a little something too. I suppose that they can be jealous too. However, your spouse may not appreciate the cat's humor,; but give them their gift anyway, why not, right? It's the thought that counts, Like Right. 7. Have you ever been sitting on the couch, holding hands with your mate, and the cat comes over, separating you two, by sitting smack-dap in the middle? Well, I suppose that they haven't heard that three's a crowd...so pick back-up later, during their cat nap...cats do the funniest things...not so humorous at the time. 8. Do you ever go in to the bathroom and leave a small crack in the door, and suddenly hear a screak? Thus, it is the cat coming to join you. Oh, well, who needs privacy anyway; but sometimes, their timing can be a bit off on wanting to be petted. Be sure to close that door all the way, never mine the little paw, peering under the door...even if you hear a soft Meow. Somethings do call for certain measures. 9. When that you are giving your dog snacks do you catch your cat trying to steal them; or they are always wanting to eat dog food, instead of their cat food? Well, the best thing to do is buy extra cat litter, and be prepared to clean the litter box a lot, for there's a lot of breading in dog food products. Besides ""pot belly"" cats can be cute; plus watching them walk can be quite humorous. 10. Do you ever try to walk and your cat, keeps getting under your feet, while that they are herding you, towards their cat food? Well, the only thing that you can do is take precaution and do not trip...and go ahead and feed them. If you should trip, don't be amazed if the cat finds it humorous. 11. Have you ever been talking on the phone, and it was a business call that called for you being in front of the computer? But, you were in another room and not on a cordless phone. Therefore, you switch phones, but leave the one that you were on off the hook. You start talking, and suddenly hear ""Meow, Meow,"" like how did you get in there? You, then, have to excuse yourself, and go and hang the other phone up, ruining the cats curiousity and fun. Then, you return to your business conversation, while apologizing for your cat."	And it is hard to take a person serious that lets their cat do their talking for them. Be careful getting on phones that aren't cordless, especially, while handling business calls; it is a good thing that cats can't dial numbers, especially long distance.

Expect reading in small doses. You might be able to sit down for hours with your head in a book, but for someone who doesn't enjoy reading, that seems like torture. Plus, some people just don't like to sit still. If you can, get your boyfriend to sit down and read for ten or fifteen minutes; don't try to push for more, and don't mock him for giving up. It's better to encourage your reading phobic boyfriend to read incrementally than to have him give up on him reading altogether. 2. Encourage him to read nonfiction. Men (who like to read) aren't as into fiction as women are. Find him a book on a subject he's interested in, and something he can apply, such as auto repair, home improvement, or even sexual techniques. Comedy is also a good choice, especially comedy directed towards men. 3. Try to get your boyfriend into Harry Potter. The Harry Potter series is one of the few cases in which fiction has been read by more males than females, and 61% of young males surveyed said they didn't read at all before reading Harry Potter. 4. See if your boyfriend will read graphic novels or manga. Both are notoriously more popular among guys. If he enjoyed a movie that was based on a graphic novel (or a comic book), give him the original source. Ideally, read it yourself so that if the original story is more interesting than the movie, you can tell him so. Some of the more popular male manga titles are: Berserk, Death Note, Bleach and Claymore. 5. Get him to read short stories. Give him a collection of short stories in a genre he enjoys, like science fiction, seafaring, adventure, or war. Eventually he may decide he really enjoys reading and would like to continue on to other books. 6. Save articles from magazines that he might be interested in. If he's interested in science or current events, look for articles on those topics. Read them yourself and give him a brief summary of what they're about. If your boyfriend is particularly passionate about any topic, you'll have better luck getting him to read articles, especially if you're willing to discuss them with him. 7.	"Is there anything he'd like you to do more of, that you find boring? Maybe you can get him to read for a half hour if you'll play catch or video games for that same amount of time. Or, if he's competitive, make a bet: ""I'll bet you can't finish that book. If you finish it, and can show that you actually paid attention to the story, I'll (insert big favor here)."""

Heal_Your_Thyroid_Naturally.txt	Begin_Revision	0.962	### Eating the Right Foods	2344	However , if you have given up salt in order to try and control your blood pressure , make sure you have an alternate source of iodine .	### Eating the Right Foods	2449	But , if you have given up salt in order to try and control your blood pressure , make sure you have an alternate source of iodine .	<replace><However><1><But><1>	True	Eating the Right Foods  1. Understand the link between nutrition and thyroid function. The thyroid depends on good nutrition to get the iodine, selenium and vitamins it needs to function properly. Without the proper nutritive balance, the thyroid cannot do its job properly. * Processed foods virtually always have sugar added to them. The thyroid can play a role in blood sugar levels and the excessive sugar in processed foods can worsen any thyroid problems. 2. Make time for nutrition. We are all very busy and many don’t feel we have enough time to cook. It often seems easier to pick up fast food or eat prepared packaged foods. While it is not always the simplest thing to do, you will be doing you and your family a great service by making your own food and encouraging everyone in your family to eat more healthily. 3. Limit the processed and pre-packaged food that you eat. It takes a bit of practice and planning, but the closer you can get to cooking from scratch, using whole foods that have not been processed (and therefore retain most of their original vitamins, minerals and other nutrients), the healthier you will be. * One general rule of thumb is that if the food is too white, such as white bread, white rice, white pasta, it has been overly processed. Eat whole grain bread, brown rice and whole grain pasta instead. Increase the vegetables and fruits in your diet. Whenever possible, choose to eat local, seasonal, organic produce; the fresher the better. However, any produce is better than no produce, and even frozen fruits and vegetables can benefit your nutritional health. 4. Limit your meat intake. Try to eat less meat, particularly red meat. If you do eat meats, make sure any beef is lean (preferably grass-fed, as this meat has a more natural ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 fats), and any poultry is skinless. * All meat you consume should be raised without hormones or antibiotics. Most meat will specify on the packaging that it is hormone-free; if it doesn’t specify that it's hormone-free, it’s probably not. Check the organic section for hormone-free meat options. 5. Boost your fish consumption. Fish is good quality protein and often has high amounts of the healthy omega-3 fats. Fish is usually lean and can be fairly easy to prepare. * Use caution when selecting fish; fish that is high in mercury may be bad for your thyroid function. 6. Include beans and legumes in your diet. Legumes include foods like lentils and contain many of the vitamins and minerals needed by the thyroid to make thyroid hormone. They are also a good source of protein for individuals who have limited or given up meat consumption. 7. Select complex carbohydrates. Most processed food contains high numbers of simple carbohydrates, which package and keep well. If you eat carbohydrates intentionally, be sure that you select complex carbohydrates such as whole grains. 8. Avoid all sugar and sugar substitutes. Simple sugar—either as granulated table sugar or as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)—is much like an addictive drug. Diabetic patients need to have their thyroid checked and thyroid patients need to have their blood sugar monitored because comorbidities—people who have both diabetes and thyroid problems—are very common. * Try using the herb stevia as a sugar substitute if you have a hard time giving up sweets. 9. Get enough iodine. If you eat a diet that includes moderate amounts of salt and some red meat, you probably get plenty of iodine.	This is because the thyroid requires iodine for proper function. If necessary, get a high quality supplement that contains at least 50% of the iodine daily requirement, but you can also supplement your diet with some of the following sources of iodine:

Seek help early. The average couple waits six years before seeking help for marital problems (and keep in mind, half of all marriages that end do so in the first seven years). This means the average couple lives with unhappiness for far too long. 2. Examine yourself. Couples who avoid saying every critical thought when discussing touchy topics are consistently the happiest. 3. Soften your ""start up."" Arguments first ""start up"" because a spouse sometimes escalates the conflict from the get-go by making a critical or contemptuous remark in a confrontational tone. Bring up problems gently and without blame. 4. Accept responsibilities. A marriage succeeds to the extent that the husband can accept responsibility from his wife."	"My mother is coming that weekend, and I need your help getting ready,"" and her husband replies, ""My plans are set, and I'm not changing them"". The marriage is coming under the influence of controversy. A husband's ability to be influenced by his wife (rather than vice-versa) is crucial because research shows women are already well practiced at accepting influence from men, and a true partnership only occurs when a husband can do so as well."

Succeed in school. Work hard in school and your parents will be impressed. Don’t skip class or spend all day watching Netflix instead of doing your homework. Make school a priority and work hard at it. Your parents will admire your hard work and dedication. Study for your tests and get good grades and your parents will be proud of you. 2. Care about your extracurricular activities. They might seem unimportant compared to your classes, but what you do outside of school is important too. Practice your free throws until you can finally make the winning shot for the school basketball team or practice the clarinet solo so much your band wins the state competition. Put time and effort into your activities and your parents will be proud of your dedication. 3. Get an after school job. This is a great way to make extra cash and show your parents how hard working you are. Even if you can only work a few hours a week at the local sandwich shop, getting an after school job will be beneficial to you and your parents will admire it. Do as many of the steps to getting a job (the resume, application, and the interview) without your parents help, but ask them questions and for advice if you need to. 4. Have career goals.	Even if you change your mind, your parents will be proud that you are already considering your future. Start thinking about what you want to do and how you want to get there and discuss it with your mom and dad.

Courage and self-confidence have to be always maintained. In these type of chronic pains, self confidence has to kept at all times at highest levels possible. The trick is the brain can not input commands to legs or hands in spinal cord injuries(SCI), and has to start all over again, like a baby learns to walk. Even if in some cases the spinal cord never gets recovered for life, self-confidence will make recovery much faster, due to the reason that if the brain detects depression or unhappiness, easy recoveries may never happen in the end. Courage gives in a human brain energy and confidence, so that the brain can stay healthy and active. If a human brain's not healthy, then in these type of injuries, recovery will be very difficult. 2. Physio therapy. In SCI, physio therapies have to be active every day until recovery. The body needs to learn how to walk properly again. Even if full recovery will never be present, dropping physio therapy will only tempt the situation to worsen.Exercise at home will built up spinal cord faster, especially faster. There is no limit in SCI-the more you exercise, the faster the recovery will be. But exercise always need to be taken in time and logical intervals. 3. Swimming. Even if physiotherapy will help the situation get better, swimming will boost the solution to full recovery. Swimming exercises all parts of the body, especially the spinal cord.	There are special swimming training centers that specialize in that kind of chronic pains. Even private hydrotherapy could be very useful.

Then, instead of weaving a spiral around with the capture thread, weave it and pin it down each time it reaches a framework thread. Use a pin each side if one pin isn't enough to pierce through the yarn and hold it in place. The pins should be the same color as the string or yarn. * Feel free to color your spider webs.

Get a tray that has small sides on it. This will contain the food securely, and keep any spillage from falling onto the bed. There are specially made small tables intended for this very purpose. If you can't find one, use a laptop desk. 2. Decide what you'll make for breakfast. Here are some ideas: * Make a tropical breakfast \- This is both healthy and refreshing. * Make one egg waffles \- These are a little healthier than most waffles, but if you really want to spoil someone, make French toast waffles. * Serve a bagel breakfast \- Be sure to include a variety of delicious condiments as well as a choice of bagels. * Cook a full English breakfast with like an english muffin with some eggs 'n orange juice, coffee or tea on the side. 3. Prepare the breakfast as quietly as possible, if there's a chance you might wake the person up. If you can chop or mix any ingredients the night before, do so. If you're making coffee, put a towel along the crack at the bottom of the bedroom door so that they don't smell it. (This is assuming that you want the breakfast in bed to be a surprise.) * Be sure to clean up after yourself, too. If the person you're treating comes into the kitchen to find a pig stye, that might kill their delight over what you just did for them. * See also the way to make a good pot of coffee and how to make tea. Don't forget to supply cream and sugar, if the person being treated likes it in their hot drink. 4. Pour any liquids only 3/4 of the way. This is especially important with hot liquids, as you don't want them to spill onto the person or the bed linen when the tray is moved. 5. Add some nice touches: * Lay a single flower down on the tray, or sprinkle flower petals across the tray. * On the plates, around the food, add some edible flowers (perhaps some candied violets?). * If using a cloth napkin, fold it into a pyramid shape. * You can also fold a paper napkin into a rose (not the one they will be using, just an extra one for decoration). * Make a card with a nice note written in it. 6. When you bring the breakfast, put it aside while you prepare the area. Use a stand such as a coffee table, or a folding table already assembled. Puff up the pillows, and add extras, so as to make sitting up more comfortable. Straighten the bed covering, so that you can place down the tray's legs (if any). If the tray is flat, add some books or something strong under the tray for support. 7. Turn on the television, play music, or give the person something to read while they eat.	.

I haven't acually tried this before, but it should work. Poor both contents of nail varnish into a small pot, and gently stir the contence untill it goes the colour you want it. But beware! As you have used to nail varnishs, the result is bound to be a little gloppy and thick so put a little water in to, to stop it making your nails 1 inch of your finger! 5.

Cut the bacon strips in half. Lie the bacon strips on a cutting board. Using a sharp kitchen knife, cut the strips in half so that the strips are half as long. This way the bacon will wrap around the scallop more evenly with less overlap. 2. Wrap the bacon around the scallop. Place one end of the half strip of bacon on the side of the scallop. Wrap the bacon all the way around the side of the scallop until the ends of the strip of bacon overlap. 3. Secure the bacon with a toothpick. Thread a toothpick into the outer, loose end of the bacon strip. Push it into the scallop, then thread the toothpick back out through the overlapped end of the strip of bacon. This will keep the bacon wrapped around the scallop and secured to it so it won’t come apart or slip off. * You can also cook up to 5 scallops on one skewer. In this case, use the skewer to secure the bacon to the scallops by threading the point through the bacon, into the scallop and back through the other end of the bacon strip. Push the scallop down from the pointed end of the skewer and repeat the process, stacking the scallops until the skewer is full. *	The saturation keeps them from catching fire.

Due to its simple chemical structures in comparison with proteins and DNA molecules organic compounds that are used in the usual organic laboratory to perform certain reactions are not selective and specific in a satisfactory fashion. For this reason performing organic reactions in the advanced lab gives a mixture of products in addition to the presence of the starting material also due to the incomplete reaction process.	This poses a problem of phase separation at the end of the reaction. This problem of selectivity and specificity is encountered in metabolic reactions in the body which usually proceed to completion with great selectivity and specificity. This mechanism is possible because of the presence in these metabolic reactions of catalysts that are called enzymes. These structures are protein molecules that have very specific three dimensional structure that are composed of long chains of amino acids. This structure has an active site that is the place where the catalytic process occurs. This active site is very specific and selective in its binding to molecules. Therefore the net result is the production of a pure metabolic product.

For example, based on the time of day, it might give you a choice among music for “work or study”, “an energy boost”, or “a weekday dance party”. Then you can pick a specific genre, and finally a playlist based on your preferences. When you select a playlist, it will begin playing. 3. Search for playlists. Alternatively, you can skip the Music Concierge process by clicking “Today's Biggest Hits” or “Brand New Music” in the middle of the page. “Today's Biggest Hits” will take you to a list of the most popular playlists, which you can adjust to cover today, the past week, or the past year. “Browse New Music” gives you list of playlist with new music. The search bar in the top left lets you search all playlists, which you can filter by genre, mood, decade, and more. To play a playlist, just click on it and then click “Play” when the icon and info for the playlist appears. 4. Sign up to manage your playlists. Sign up by clicking on the blue “Sign up” button on the left. You can create an account by entering a username and email or via your Facebook account.	.

There are also things called home school co-ops and are in loads of areas they can help each other and swap textbooks your child will make plenty of new friends at the meetings!  5. Making the lessons fun. To make the lessons fun, it is best to know if you are learning something interesting in history or science. You can always go on many trips after you have finished the subject. Places may include, the museum, the zoo, an aquarium etc.  6. Watch DVDs or watch something educational. This will always help with a child's education and will keep them more involved in the work. * You don't just have to learn out of a textbook. For music lessons you can join a music class or buy an instrument and learn different techniques through YouTube videos and teach that way! For P.E you can go roller/ice skating or swimming these are all fun ways to get exersize. Also you can join a sports team or go to tennis, ice skating, football classes. This is a fun way to make new friends! 7. Laws: In some states or countries you need to keep a portfolio of all the work you or your child has been doing. It is good to keep one anyway as you can show this to a college or university as proof of what yo have been learning. 8. There are various things to be considered is you plan on home-schooling your child.	Be there when they need help. It is quite hard to home school yourself and requires much dedication and commitment in order to get a good education.

Learn_to_Dance.txt	Begin_Revision	0.955	## Steps	3323	As some people prefer to dance at a theater or stage , others like to dance in the privacy of their living room .	### Part 2: Dancing to Your Own Beat	3395	While some people prefer to dance at a theater or stage , others like to dance in the privacy of their living room .	<replace><As><1><While><1>	True	Steps  1. Find a style of dance you like. There are so many styles out there, and there has to be one that you are bound to like. Focusing on 2 or 3 styles you are really into will help a lot. You'll be practicing more with that style, and you will commit better to fewer styles rather than trying to learn to dance 15 different routines or styles. It may take months to find a style you are really into, so don't rush it. Some styles are Contemporary, Ballroom, Latin, Hip Hop, Break dancing, Jazz,Lyrical, Ballet, Belly, Pole, Swing, Salsa, Krump, Foxtrot, and Tango. So, how do you know which one's right for you? * Research your dance. Look online, in books, on TV, movies, newspaper, anywhere that has information on a particular type of dance. Read it carefully and you may be surprised. Try to find out where it was developed, where the name of the dance comes from, its history, any the other forms of that dancing style. You may be interested in its history so much that you will want to give it a try. * Look for simple routines for that dance on TV or online. Watch a few first, and see if you like the moves, beat, and rhythm. Then start to, as best as you can, copy the moves that the person/people dancing. See how you like it. Is that dance fun? Give it a couple tries before you give up and decide that style is not to your liking. * Keep goals and what you know in mind. If you have good posture, can stretch your legs and point your toes, try classical ballet, not hip hop. When you research the dance, make sure you know the body placements and see which ones you think you can do well (but you are learning). 2. Dance at your own pace. When you see professional dancers, or cool moves online, you will most likely want to be able to dance like them, but it can't be done right away. If you try to dance at a level that is going too fast for you, you won't be able to have fun learning and performing the moves. Likewise, if you feel that you know how to dance more advanced than what you are dancing, find some harder moves, or try moving to a higher dance class, if you go to one. * Learn the basics first. For, say, ballet, try to learn the warm ups and basic positions, like first, second, etc. before you try to perform jumps and turns. Starting at the very beginning will help you not be frustrated when you cannot do something, and will help you improve your technique for more complicated moves. 3. Dance where you are comfortable.	Nobody, especially when just learning to dance, is pressuring you to dance somewhere where you aren't comfortable. Practice dancing where you want, whether it's alone, with a partner, or with a small group. Try dancing in front of different people, with different people, and in different places to see which you like best. Some styles of dance need a partner, or require a group, but see how much you can practice on your own.

Calorie counting is a thoughtful approach that makes sure you stay within healthy energy and nutrition levels. Without this thoughtful approach, you may end up with malnutrition. * The technical definition of a calorie is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 liter of water by 1°C. Food is the body's energy source, and the more calories we take in, the more fuel we have. * However, the processed food of today is higher in calorie counts than the food of our ancestors — the food our bodies are used to. * When we eat more calories than we need to just get through the day, the body stores that energy away for later.

Choose a container, vase, or basket. This must be a container that is able to hold water. 2. Soak a piece of floral foam (oasis in water) completely cover oasis with water to make sure it is saturated. (about 15 minutes) 3. Remove oasis from water. With a knife, cut the foam to fit into container with about an inch over the containers top. 4. make an x taping the foam down to the edges with green floral tape so it does not shift. Foam should fit tightly in container. If there is too much water you may empty it out. 5. Find the center to start. You are now ready to add your greens. You can decide how long or how short but it's nice to green a container with the edging longer . You do not have to cover all the foam, just enough that when flowers are in place you will not see the foam after. 6. Cut the flower of your choice for center. Make it tall, about 1 1/2 length taller than you container. When working with flowers always work in odd numbers. So your center flower is one, now choose odd amounts of same flower. Usually do 5 for this flower. 7. Add the same flower as in the center to each side of the arrangement. That gives you four. (Cut flowers to length you want piece to hang over.) The 5th flower cut a bit shorter than center and place in foam next to it. 8. Now begin to add other flowers, always in odds. Fill in using space one; do not worry about leaving gaps. You can always fill those in later. You want the flowers to have spaces. Work your way around piece all sides. Do not worry about the piece being all the same all around. 9. Place flowers at angles and use bright small flowers for filler. 10. You need to fill in gaps and here are a few options. Add small pieces of Gyp (babies breath ) and fill in sections . Or make loops out of ribbon (floral wire the ribbon loops to a wood pic) Place those in between. Some florist use greens (tree fern). Whatever you choose is alright.	.

English Literature, for example, may be broken down into the different books you are studying and then further into chapters/themes/quotes etc. Highlight or circle the different subjects using different colours. 3. Number the different tasks. Mix your subjects up. Don't put all your nightmare subjects on one day, and the ones you like on an other day. 4. Decide which tasks you should only spend short bursts of time on and which you should maybe spend a whole day on to get out of the way. The second should be reserved for big projects that you won't get tired with. 5. Allocate days for the big projects. Do this first, keeping in mind you may need to go back and change things at a later date, so allow time for this. 6. Out of the remaining days, make sure you write down any other commitments you have e.g. a job, lessons, meeting, or social events. 7. Decide what times you work best and put the tasks that require more energy or concentration during your optimum times. 8. When putting the rest of your revision into your diary/table, put times down and make sure you start each day reasonably early. 9. Start your day off with something you know you can accomplish. This will give you more motivation for the rest of the day. Make sure the next slot is something heavier so that you don't put off your worst subjects until the end. 10. It has been said that the optimum concentration time is 32 minutes so keep this in mind when deciding how long each session should last. 11. Give yourself regular breaks. If when doing your revision you are on a roll, you can always decide to keep going. 12. Cross things off as you do them because it will give you a sense of accomplishment! 13.

Know that breathing techniques can lower your heart rate. It is widely known that stress can increase your heart rate. When you are stressed, your body releases adrenaline, increasing your heart rate to assist in dealing with the stressor. Breathing techniques relax and calm your body and mind, thereby lowering your heart rate. * Deep breaths provide oxygen to the lowest portion of your lungs, which are usually deprived of their share of oxygen. * Breathing techniques encourage proper oxygen exchange, stabilizing your blood pressure, calming your mind, and lowering your heart rate. * Practice breathing techniques regularly in the morning, on an empty stomach. * You can also do these exercises when you are stressed and looking to relax yourself. 2. Practice various types of breathing techniques to lower your heart rate. There are a variety of breathing techniques that you can try to lower your heart rate. Some are derived from yoga, and others are far more basic. Choose a breathing regimen that works for you. * Kapalabhati breathing: * Sit in Lotus Pose or Thunderbolt Pose * Place both your palms on your stomach on either side of your belly button. * Inhale through both your nostrils. * Exhale with force by contracting your abdominal muscles. * Repeat the process of inhalation and exhalation till you complete 10 rounds. * Abdominal Breathing: * Sit down with your back straight. You may also sit on a chair but make sure your spine is erect. * Place your hands on the abdomen to feel the stomach when you breathe. * Inhale slowly and deeply. * As you inhale, focus on your abdomen and feel its rise. * Exhale slowly through your nose as you pull your abdomen in. * Repeat it for 10 rounds initially. You may increase the duration to 3 minutes when you are comfortable with abdominal breathing. * Alternate Nostril Breathing: * Assume Lotus Pose or Easy Pose. * Fold the index and middle fingers of your right hand and keep the remaining fingers open. * Place your right thumb on the right nostril to block inhalation. * Inhale deeply and slowly through your left nostril. * After deep inhalation, close your left nostril with your ring finger in the right hand. As you do son, release your right nostril. * Now exhale through the right nostril. * After exhaling through the right nostril, with the left still closed, inhale through the right nostril. * Close your right nostril with your thumb, release the left nostril and exhale through it. * Doing so completes one round. Do up to 5 rounds to begin with. After you get comfortable with the breathing technique, increase the count to do 10 rounds. 3. Meditate to lower your heart rate. The health benefits of meditation are well-established. Meditation relieves you of stress, improves your heart health, and makes your mind more alert. * Heart Chakra meditation is one of the types of meditation that reduces your heart rate. Follow these steps to try it: * Assume a comfortable seated posture. * Place your focus on your body and relax all your joints and muscles. * Place the right palm over your chest in the heart region and place the left palm over the right. * With closed eyes, imagine that your heart is receiving energy from the Universe. * Imagine the energy flowing through your body to reach all parts of your body. * Imagine the energy flowing to the parts of your body which you feel are depleted of energy. * Do so for quite some time, until you feel your body thoroughly energized. * The duration of the meditation depends on your focus and your health condition. With practice, both will improve. * Simple deep-breathing exercise: * Find a quiet place where you can relax. * Be in comfortable position: sitting or standing. * Place your hands down on the border of your rib cage. * Breathe in through your nose. Inhale slowly and evenly until your chest is fully expanded. * Hold your breath for 3 seconds. * Exhale through your mouth, pushing out as much air as you can while contracting your abdominal muscles. Count slowly as you exhale. * Progressive relaxation: * Sit comfortably in a chair, with your feet on the ground. * Tense and tighten your right fist. Focus on feeling of tension as you do so. * Allow the muscles in your right fist to relax. Contrast the difference in feeling from tension to relaxation. * Repeat the steps above. * Now tense and relax both your left and right fists. * Focus on the feeling of relaxation. * Now tighten the muscles in both fist and both arms. Feel the tension, fully relax the muscles, and again focus on the sensation of relaxation. * Progressively tighten and relax each muscle in the body, toes, ankles, knees, buttocks, groin, stomach and lower back muscles, chest and upper back muscles, shoulders, forehead, jaw muscles. * Couple deep breathing with progressive relaxation. 4. Focus on guided imagery techniques to relax your mind. Guided imagery is a technique used to help reduce unnecessary worry and stop anxious thoughts. It can help you focus and relax, and decrease the negative impact of stressors. * Prepare yourself for visualization. Avoid watching television, surfing the net, and other stressors. * Find a quiet and comfortable place to rest and meditate. * If possible, lie down. * Imagine yourself at a beach, walking, striding in the sand, with the breeze blowing in your face. Imagine you are gently floating on the water. * Then, allow yourself to explore in that peaceful place you are imagining. *	.

Urban areas face different challenges than rural areas. 2. Keep the cold inside. If the temperature rises, take anything out of the refrigerator that might spoil and prepare to cook it or consume it before it warms up. Eat perishables before spoilage can occur. 3. Have stable food that does not require refrigeration. Those that do not require cooking are even better. Canned meats, fish, soups, vegetables, and juices will work, and can be kept for months at a time. Crackers, cookies and snacks for the kiddies are a necessity. Eat these items after the perishables are eaten or are unsafe to eat. * To make perishables last longer, avoid opening the fridge unless absolutely necessary.

Be okay with conflict, but choose your battles carefully. Many couples have a tendency to sweep problems under the rug because they fear conflict. In truth, conflict is a normal and necessary aspect that allows a relationship to grow. You and your partner are going to have disagreements. That’s fine. However, your entire relationship shouldn’t be marked by arguments.center * A healthy relationship should involve primarily positive interactions. If either partner is always complaining or nagging, your relationship could be in jeopardy. Know when to lay off on the nitpicking. * Approach your partner with issues that compromise your values or the health of the relationship. Ask yourself, “Will this matter in a month, a year, or five years?” If not, let it slide. 2. Pause before saying something you’ll regret. Follow the 48-hour rule when resolving conflict. Anger can corrode communication and lead to words being exchanged that you later wish you had kept to yourself. Take time apart to cool off before rehashing an argument.center * When you feel angry, give yourself a day or two before discussing the problem with your partner. Use the time to care for yourself emotionally. Spend time with friends (without venting about your partner). Journal. It may even help to jot down your thoughts about the disagreement. *	Again, use “I” statements like “I was really disappointed that you flaked on my performance the other night. It was a big deal to me. And I’d hoped you’d be there.”

Maintain_a_Vacuum_Cleaner.txt	Begin_Revision	0.949	## Steps	443	If you take the bearings out , notice which way they went so you can put them back in correctly .	## Steps	518	Before you take the bearings out , notice which way they went so you can put them back in correctly .	<replace><If><1><Before><1>	True	Steps  1. Unplug your vacuum cleaner before performing any maintenance on it. A vacuum cleaner that turns on unexpectedly while you are working on it can injure you or simply make a mess. 2. Check the bag regularly and replace it when it is full. A vacuum cleaner bag that is only 1/3 full may be too full to clean efficiently. Remember that the air must pass through all the collected dust and debris, so a full vacuum cleaner bag means that the machine must work harder, or that it will not clean as well, or both. Look for a line on the bag and feel with your hand to determine about how full it is. * If a working vacuum cleaner misses debris on the carpet or leaves behind fuzz where there was none, that's also a cue to check the bag. 3. Replace any vacuum bag that is 1/3 to 1/2 full. Read the directions on the vacuum cleaner, the bag, or in the manual. Regardless of the procedure, make sure that the bag is on all the way and secure, and that any clips or holders are in place. * Use the correct bag size and type for your machine. 4. Empty the bin or tray on bagless models frequently. Most designs make it very easy to pop the bin out. 5. Clean the brush roll. Also called a beater bar by some, this is the spinning brush underneath that brushes dirt out of the carpets. * Look under the machine and locate the beater bar. Generally, it will be across the front of the bottom. If it is full of hair, thread, or other debris, it is time to clean it. * Remove the bottom plate. This part may have clips or latches, or it may have a couple of screws holding it in place. Don't lose the screws. * Notice the direction that the brush roll goes in. Usually, there will be a belt on one side and a corresponding track or space on the brush roll for the belt. This will help you to identify the direction. * Remove the brush roll. Generally, it will pull out of a slot on either end, then slide out from under the belt. * Use scissors or just your fingers to clean the brushes. They don't need to be spotless, but you should remove any hair that is wrapped around the brush, Pay special attention to the ends where the bearings are and to the area around where the belt engages. 6. Clean the bearings on the brush roll, if necessary. * Spin the brush roll on its axle with your fingers, to verify that it spins freely. If it doesn't, you may need to clean out the bearings more thoroughly or replace the entire brush roll. * Unscrew the cap on either end of the brush roll. You will need to hold the cap on the opposite end. * Remove any debris around and in the bearings.	.

Remember there are things your spouse can't change; for example they can't change his/her height. Don't expect too much changes from them. 4. Have a personal one to one discussion with your spouse. Be firm and straight to the point. First, tell them the 10 things you love about them. Then, tell them those things you hated about the marriage and provide suggestion on how they can change to make things better. 5. Listen to your spouse and take hints on what they say about your behaviour. Don't be selfish, you need to also change for your partner. This is your turn to listen to them and ask them what changes they will like to see in you. Remember, marriage is a teamwork effort. 6. Be Forgiving. To maintain a marriage, you need to understand the importance of forgiving your partner for any wrong they have done. Leave the past behind, be more positive and look forward to a brighter future. And refrain from blaming your partner over and again for something they did in the past. This will make them feel, their is no future or hope in the marriage and that the last thing you wanted when you are trying to save the marriage. 7. Be Apologetic: Sometime, we might be the one that have wrong our spouse and causing them to act in a way causing us to be unsure of our marriage. Do you remember the last time you genuinely said 'SORRY' to your spouse? Maybe, your spouse is still madly in love with you but they feeling you have become cure and uncaring? Take time out and have a deep reflection on you manners. Are you really that nice to your partner? 8. Do not do anything stupid like cheating on your spouse. Trust is very fundamental in any marriage and you don't want your spouse to lose trust in you. 9. Always say 'thank you' to your spouse, as soon as you observe a positive change, even a small positive change.	A mere kiss and hug are very powerful gesture in making your spouse acting more positive toward you. Don wait for a long time to say 'Thank You' as it losses it value as time goes.

Start with her hair. Ariana is well known for her ""red velvet"" color that she has on Sam & Cat. They use a temporary glaze for the color, so currently, her hair is back to her natural color, brown, with blonde ombred tips. (The ombre is fading a bit, but if you Google ""Ariana Grande Ombre"", you'll see it.) Ariana's signature hairstyle is a curled half-up half-down do. To accomplish this look, slick the top half of your hair back into a sleek ponytail and tie it carefully. Then curl the ends of your hair. For a more detailed explanation, look at photos or watch tutorials on YouTube. 2. The next step is makeup. Ariana uses simple, fresh makeup that doesn't distract from her natural beauty. She only uses the basics; concealer/foundation, mascara, a tiny bit of eyeliner, and a fresh, natural color of eye shadow. She likes to finish off the look with a swipe of pale pink lip gloss. Ariana wore a lot more eyeliner and mascara when she was younger, so you can try that if you want your eyes to appear larger. She claims that since she's Italian, she has dark circles under her eyes, so she always wears concealer. Ariana has also confessed that she hates when red carpet stylists put too much makeup on her, so keep your makeup simple. Don't overdo it. Ariana uses Hoola bronzer and Laura Mercier blush. One of her favorite brands is Urban Decay. She currently has a makeup tutorial on her YouTube channel (osnapitzari) with all of her favorite products. You can watch that for some more tips. 3. Style is very important. Ariana's style is cute, girly, retro, and sophisticated. She has many different personalities when it comes to style. You can see her in anything from a Dolce & Gabbana dress, to a flirty high-waisted skirt, to jeans and her favorite sweatshirt. She wears classy dresses for award shows and premieres, but they're usually strapless - don't feel pressured to wear those if you're not comfortable. However, Ariana also likes flowery, bubblegum sundresses that let her girly personality shine. She doesn't use too much jewelry, so stick with a simple bracelet or necklace. She mostly wears high heels (her favorite pair is her nude pumps). If you're still pretty young, go for a pair of pretty flats. Ariana wears a lot of two-piece sets, such as crop tops, bandeaus, or bustiers with a skirt or a pair of high-waisted shorts. If your school has a dress code or if you're not allowed to show that much skin, opt for camisoles instead. Aside from Ariana's girly, 50's inspired attire, she also relies on baggy jumpers and sweatshirts while shopping, meeting fans, etc. To have an Ariana inspired wardrobe, you'll need a few essential pieces, such as nude pumps, flirty and floral sundresses, crop tops, American Apparel skirts and high waisted shorts, bandeaus, and don't forget your Rilakkuma iPhone case. You can also refer to outfits Cat Valentine has worn on Victorious and Sam & Cat. Cat's style is quite a bit different from Ariana's, so you'll have more choices if you choose to dress like both of them. Cat wears younger pieces, so her style doesn't look as sophisticated as Ariana's, which is a good style for if you're a lot younger than her. Google ""Cat Valentine outfits"" for inspiration. Ariana's favorite clothing stores are Nasty Gal, Wildfox Couture, Forever 21, Topshop, American Apparel, Brandy Melville, Abercrombie, LF Stores, and Urban Outfitters. Her favorite designer is Kenley Collins, who custom makes a lot of outfits for Ariana. 4. Take good care of your skin. Ariana's skin is very healthy. She was born and raised in Florida, so she has a nice, natural color. To get beautiful, glowing skin like hers, drink lots of water (one of her personal tips) and eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Ariana's favorite fruits are strawberries and grapes, and she eats them a lot to make her skin look healthy. If you've been suffering from acne, make sure you wash your face twice a day (don't wash it any more than that because it can irritate your skin and cause even more acne). 5. Be active and stay fit. Ariana has lost some weight in the past year or so by following a good diet and exercising regularly. Her good friend and choreographer Isaac Calpito helped her lose weight by teaching her all about nutrition, weight loss, and how to keep herself fit. Ariana eats organic oatmeal with fruit every morning to get her body ready for the day. She usually eats it with two hard boiled eggs and a handful of almonds for protein. Since she has long work days, she usually eats healthy snacks like Think Thins, Live Raw bars or Pure bars, which are healthier than Special K bars. For lunch and dinner, Ariana usually has some lean protein like salmon or chicken along with fruits and vegetables. By eating this way, you get to eat every 2-4 hours and have around 5 small meals a day instead of 3 big ones. Even though you're consuming more calories, it's good for your body because the ingredients are healthy and your body can use them for nourishment and not store them as fat. Also, eating more makes your metabolism work faster and harder. These are all Ariana's secrets to losing weight. Eating fewer calories and counting calories has nothing to do with losing weight. It's about the type of food you put into your body. In fact, consuming a lot of calories is better than skipping meals, as long as the calories you're consuming are from good, healthy foods. Also, remember to exercise and keep yourself active."	.

However, for people who are allergic to aspirin the medication can make their health much worse instead of making them feel better. Risks vary depending to your body's sensitivity to the drug and the severity of the aspirin allergy symptoms. To live with an allergy to aspirin, one not only has to avoid the medication but also other items that contain salicylates. IMPORTANT NOTE Most people are NOT allergic to aspirin, but have what is called ""intolerance"" to it. This means that small amounts (such as in food) can be tolerated, but can, over time, build up and cause allergy-like symptoms."	.

Pick the one thing you think your mom likes best, then start to collect pictures and items that reflect that interest. For a beach loving mom, you might want to collect sea shells, a bag of sand, some pictures of beaches from old magazines or catalogs. For a computer loving mom, find computer ads, old microchips (check with Dad before you take any of those!), or print-outs of source code pages from the Internet. 3. Write, cut out, or print out words that describe what your mom likes to do. For a mom who likes to cook, choose words like ""baking"", ""gourmet"", or ""dinner."" Experiment with different fonts or letter styles and colors. 4. Have Dad or another adult help you buy a picture mat from Walmart, K-mart, Target, or a craft store like Michael's. These come in all kinds of sizes, and are usually under $5.00. 5. Create a collage of Mom's favorite theme on the edges of the mat. Use regular glue, or glue sticks for papers and pictures, and have an adult help you with a glue gun for attaching things like shells, beads, or other heavier decorations. Cover the whole mat edge with decorations. 6. When the decorated frame is dry, find a picture of you and Mom together, or one of Mom doing what she likes best. If you can't find a photo, draw and color a picture of you and Mom doing what she likes to do. Attach the picture to the back of the frame so it shows through. 7. Write your name, and the date on the back of the frame. 8. If you'd like, attach small magnets to the back of the frame so Mom can hang it on the fridge or her office filing cabinet."	.

If you already live in a Mormon dense city (Greater Salt Lake, or Provo) try a different neigborhood. Even though it's normally discouraged, changing wards (if you can't move) is a relatively minor decision compared to leaving the church altogether. If you decide to leave the church, outline your reasons very clearly in your mind and have confidence that your heart is guiding you. 2. On the way out, don't bad-mouth people in the church or its basic beliefs. You'll only offend/hurt people at church and make yourself look bad/evil. If you need to speak freely, do it with people who are at least impartial (i.e. not extremely for or against the church). 3. Stop going to church and activities. When invited by members to attend, decline politely. 4. When home visitors/visiting teachers/your bishop/friends/acquaintances start asking if you're ok, or calling you for appointments, simply tell them that you appreciate their concern and that you are searching your heart to make decisions that are right for you. Be friendly, but politely and assertively tell them that you will come if it feels right to you. 5. Find something to do that makes you feel good on days you would normally go to church/institute/activities. Talk to people about your feelings when you're feeling guilty/upset. Ask your self why you feel that way. 6. Write out your feelings and reasons, taking careful time to think about your reasons for leaving. 7.	This is the final step. Once taken, it will be difficult to re-join the Church, so make sure this is what you really want.

Bitter cold winters aren't much fun to ride in, so be sure to have plenty of cold weather gear if necessary. Also be sure to check out the bike accessibility of the area: does the city or neighborhood have well-marked bike lanes, or will you be brushing up against cars on a narrow shoulder?

Understand that some small part of you (even though you think of yourself as 'evolved' and experienced) can't seem to let go of that certain someone. The regret and loss you may be feeling, amongst many other emotions, is because you miss many things about your relationship. Possibly the warmth, intimacy, conversations and sharing, even their distinctive smell. 2. Know that it is so easy to dwell on all the good things we remember, and lose sight of the reasons why it ended, whether it was yourself or them. Even knowing this, you may still find yourself so sad you are sobbing into a pillow, wishing be able to hold them one more time. However, know that these actions are acceptable. Sometimes, it may take a while to get over a relationship. 3. Remember that all of us have an idea of what we would like to have in that special someone, and have often thought to have found it until the relationship ends. Consider the possibility that you may made the wrong choice and that you expected that person to fulfill their end of that expectation. 4. Accept the fact you may have made the wrong choice. Your disappointment is in direct proportion to your expectations. If you are, or have been, devastated by the break up, then you probably had a great deal of hope and trust tied up in your partner. Accept that any partner who makes you sad, or betrayed you, who makes you cry is not worth it. The one who is worth it, won't make you cry. 5. Do whatever it takes to give yourself some kind of resolution or closure, but do it without that eternal hope that you are going to get back together. Accept that doing so is never a wise option. This seldom ever works. Realize that truth does not change facts. Think on things as long as you like, or talk things through with someone who can listen. 6. Pour your heart out, and cuss the idiot out all you like. However, keep in mind that you made a wrong choice so you are going to have to accept a little responsibility whether you like it or not. At the end of the day, that old saying we have all heard so often is the only thing that will make a true difference and be healthy at the same time. ""Time heals all wounds"". Wounds are only healed by eliminating infection,and being more careful in the future, not by kissing it and making it feel better for a moment. The longer you postpone the inevitable, the harder it is to cure. Your decision to only patch your injury versus eliminating it is totally in your own hands. 7. Blaming the other for a failed relationship is OK but failing to exit and move on, punishing yourself more by hanging on to what obviously didn't work or seeking recouncilation to convince yourself past horrors don't matter only indicate some of the reasons you made the wrong choice from the beginning. Get over it and move forward. Your heart deserves good health in every way."	.

Lower your sodium intake. Many people eat as much as 3,500 mg of sodium per day. The DASH diet, which is short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, recommends no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day. Sodium is in salt, so the best way to reduce your sodium intake is to eat less salt. You can do this by: * Not adding table salt to your food. This may also include reducing the amount of salt you use when cooking. Easy ways to do this include not salting meats and not adding salt to the water when you cook rice or pasta. * Avoiding salty snacks and processed food such as chips, pretzels, and salted nuts. They often have large amounts of salt added to them. If you do purchase prepared foods, look to see if you can get a low-salt version. Check the contents of canned food, premixed seasonings, bouillon cubes, canned soups, jerkies, and sports drinks to see if they have salt added to them. 2. Eat six to eight servings of grains per day. Whole grains are better than processed white rice or processed white flour because they have more fiber and nutrients. A serving is a slice of bread or a half a cup of cooked rice or pasta. You can eat more whole grains by: * Buying whole wheat flour and pasta instead of white. Many whole wheat bread products will say on the packaging that they are whole wheat. * Oatmeal and brown rice are also excellent sources of nutrients and fiber. 3. Load up on fruits and vegetables. You should eat four to five servings of fruit and four to five servings of vegetables each day. A serving is a half a cup of leafy vegetables or a ½ cup of cooked vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are great sources of potassium and magnesium which help to lower your blood pressure. Excellent ways to get your fruits and vegetables include: * Eating salads with your meals. You can keep them interesting by varying what you put in them. You can add a sweet element by putting apple or orange slices on a salad. Leave on the peels of thin-skinned fruits like apples because they also contain nutrients. You can also go more traditional with fresh greens, carrots, and tomatoes. But go easy on the salad dressings: they often have a lot of salt and fatty oils. * Making vegetables a side dish. Instead of cooking pasta, try putting the main dish over a sweet potato or next to a side of squash. * Snacking on fruits and vegetables between meals. Take an apple, banana, carrot, cucumber or green pepper with you to work or school. * Buying fresh and frozen vegetables. If you are worried about having fresh produce go bad before you eat it, frozen vegetables are an excellent choice. You can put them in the freezer until you need them and when you thaw them, they will still be packed with nutrients. 4. Add low-fat dairy products. Dairy is an important source of calcium and vitamin D, but it is important to choose carefully to avoid eating too much fat and salt. A cup is a serving. Aim for two to three servings per day. * Cheese is often high in salt, so eat it sparingly. * When you eat yogurt and drink milk, go for the low-fat or skim varieties. Both are great with whole-grain cereals for breakfast. 5. Eat lean meat, poultry and fish in moderation. Meats and fish are excellent sources of protein, vitamins, iron and zinc, but some kinds can be high in fat and cholesterol. Since fat and cholesterol can clog your arteries, it is best to not eat too much. Eat no more than six servings per day. A serving is an ounce of meat or an egg. * Avoid fatty red meats, and if you do eat them, cut the fat off as much as possible. When you cook, don’t fry your meats. Healthier alternatives include baking, grilling, or roasting. * Salmon, herring and tuna are great sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Eating these fish can help control your cholesterol and they are high in protein. 6. Control your fat consumption. Fat increases your risk of heart disease. To protect your heart, restrict your fat intake to a maximum of three servings per day. A tablespoon of butter is a serving. Easy ways to reduce your fat intake include: * Not spreading butter or mayonnaise on breads.	Substitute skim milk for whole milk and avoid heavy cream, lard, solid shortenings, palm and coconut oils.

Using the same cake batter recipe as above, divide your batter equally into four shallow bowls to make the base cakes. Use a layer of parchment paper to keep the batter from sticking. For the dome cake, simply fill the bowl a bit more. * You can use round baking pans or stainless steel bowls to bake your cakes. * If you don’t have four bowls of the same size, simply pour the batter into the same bowl one cake at a time. 2. Bake your cakes at for 30 minutes. Check on your cakes every 7 minutes or so, adjusting the time as needed. They should get golden brown on top, but shouldn’t look burnt. * You can check if your cake is done by sticking a toothpick into the center.

Make_a_Double_Eyelid.txt	Begin_Revision	0.951	## Steps	711	When choosing a surgeon for double eyelid surgery , make sure you select a doctor with specific experience with Asian eyelids .	## Tips	748	If choosing a surgeon for double eyelid surgery , make sure you select a doctor with specific experience with Asian eyelids .	<replace><When><1><If><1>	True	"Steps  1. Learn the difference between an Asian and Caucasian double eyelid. Asian eyelid creases begin close to the eyelash at the inner corner of the eye, and move parallel to the brow by the midpoint of the eye. In contrast, Caucasian eyelid creases form an upside-down ""U"" shape, with a taper closer to the shape of the eyelashes. One effect of this is that the application of eyeliner will not be noticeable unless the eyes are closed. 2. Create double eyelids through the use of cosmetic products like double eyelid glue or eyelid tape. These are temporary ways that allow you to see what you will look like with double eyelids. These techniques typically last a day and wash away with soap and water when you wash the rest of your face. 3. Wash your face well prior to applying double eyelid glue or tape, so you have a clean, non-oily surface to work with. Pat the face dry, paying extra attention to the eye area. Wait a few minutes to ensure the area is completely dry before applying the double eyelid adhesive. 4. Apply the eyelid tape or glue just above your lash line. For a natural look, follow the natural line of the inner wall of your eye socket. If you are using double eyelid glue, wait 30 to 60 seconds for the adhesive to set before pushing the eyelid into place. If you are applying eyelid tape, you can begin the next step right away. 5. Gently push your upper eyelid toward the adhesive strip, using a ""Y"" tool or the end of a bobby pin. Work one small section of the eyelid at a time, waiting 30 seconds to 1 minute to ensure that portion of the eyelid adheres completely to the upper lid before moving to the next section. 6. Apply cosmetics, such as eyeshadow, mascara and liner to the eye to enhance the look as desired. The double eyelid should last throughout the day, until you wash off the adhesive with soap and warm water. 7. Consider eyelid surgery for a more permanent solution for double eyelids. Double eyelid surgery, also known as blepharoplasty, has become one of the top cosmetic procedures requested by Asian women today. The surgery is typically performed with a local anesthetic as an outpatient procedure, and recovery takes about 6 weeks to complete. *"	This ensures your procedure enhances the overall appearance of the eye without actually Westernizing the face and compromising your Asian ethnicity.

Live_in_the_Present_(Spiritual_Way).txt	Inside_Revision	0.894	### Practice Dis-identification from mind	12819	As craving or attachment is not there , you honor and enjoy them even more , but do n't miss them when they are gone .	### Practice Dis-identification from the Mind	15088	When craving or attachment is not there , you honor and enjoy them even more , but do n't miss them when they are gone .	<replace><As><1><When><1>	True	"Practice Dis-identification from mind  1. Realize deeply that you are not your mind. You are not the incessant stream of thoughts and emotions. Most of your pain and suffering is self-created due to identification with the hypnotic 'voice in your head' (thoughts) and emotions. You follow this voice or take the stories and its narration as truth. That's the dysfunction and greatest obstacle to awakening. Deeply realize that you are not your thoughts and emotions but the knowing(observer) that sees the mind(observed). Read Dissolve the Ego (According to Eckhart Tolle's Teachings) for more depth. * Example: When someone else's or your own mind is mean to you and you feel hurt, it's not from the words, but due to automatic mental-emotional interpretation of those words; the extent to which you identify with it. Even if words were designed to hurt or reaction is justified, conventionally. * ""There's nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so"" William Shakespeare. * It's true that words have great power to put hypnotic spells on you, but its only because you see yourself as no more than name and form; unaware of your essence. The still spaciousness or awareness that you are.. Nothing that comes and goes is you. * Often ask questions like ""Who's talking here? Me or the voice in head"",""Do I need to continue to think?"", ""What would happen if I stop thinking?"", ""Who am I?"", ""Am I these thoughts and emotions?"" etc. Feel the inner body for answer. If you tried to understand or ask the mind, you will not find a true answer as thought by its very nature is limited. 2. See the illusion. To ensure its survival Ego needs to identify with content or conditions. Which could be physical appearance, ideas, beliefs, life stories, victim identity, situation, age, disease, wealth, body or collective identifications like nationality, political party, nationality etc. It doesn't care if the content is good or bad, as long as it has a story or something to identify with. If you look more deeply, on a fundamental level, it's all about identification with thoughts and emotions. As ultimately all these identifications become thought forms in your head, contributing towards your fearful illusoryself image. For example: Your house becomes a thought form in your head and attaches itself to primordial 'I'. This identification or attachment says 'I have a house'. Remove the 'house', which is content, from 'I' and this would cause suffering. Cause Ego is a derivative sense of self. Even if the house is in a dire condition and better to get rid of. * None of that (forms or conditions) is you. You in essence are the awareness, that is aware of thoughts, emotions, objects, people situations etc. that come and go. Without which there would be no perception or experience. . * ""The Master gives himself up to whatever the moment brings. He knows that he is going to die, and he has nothing left to hold on to; no illusions in his mind, no resistances in his body."" Tao Te Ching. 3. See the unstable nature of forms. The very nature of the conditions or forms or structures is unstable and fleeting. Buddha made this central part of his teachings. He called it Anicca. From your thoughts and emotions to events to conditions to people to buildings to mountains to planets to stars to galaxies and so on; all forms come and go, change and dissolve, except the space where they come and go. What is space? Emptiness or nothingness and so are you, in essence. Cause you are inseparable from one life. For more depth read Know Your True Self and Become Mentally Flexible. * ""There was something formless and perfect before the universe was born. It is serene. Empty. Solitary. Unchanging. Infinite. Eternally present. It is the mother of the universe."" Tao Te Ching. * Dis-identification or detachment from forms does not mean to relinquish possessions, family, friends etc and live in woods or something. It actually means to truly see and realize the fleetingness and impermanent nature of all forms. That's when things are forms they lose their seriousness and significance that they don't have."	Cause deep down you know that all is fine and world can't provide you long lasting fulfillment. Read Dissolve the Ego (According to Eckhart Tolle's Teachings) for more depth.

Acknowledge the challenges of the past. Unresolved past experiences can sometimes produce lasting psychological and physiological effects. In such cases, it’s important to come to terms with how your past is affecting your current outlook or habits. * An important first step is to stop trying to pretend you aren't affected by past events. You can't get over the past until you accept it. If something happens that reminds you of a traumatic event or triggers a strong emotional reaction, try to calmly acknowledge to yourself that this is the case. Let yourself feel what you feel about the past. Later steps in this article provide some specific strategies to help with this. * For example, if you find yourself in a social situation that triggers powerful emotions about the past, don't try to push them away. Instead, excuse yourself for a moment and step away from the group. Then, take a moment to reflect on the past and how it is affecting you before rejoining the group. * The impact of past traumas can be especially strong if you are without a strong social support network. * Sometimes, the trauma resulting from past experiences can be so intense that it affects the people you care about. Unresolved past experience can prevent you from building strong relationships with your loved ones. They can also keep you preoccupied with dreams that never came to fruition. This, in turn, can affect your current outlook and habits in ways that make it hard to cope with obstacles in your life. 2. Understand how trauma affects the brain. Traumatic or particularly intense experiences can affect our neurochemistry. At times, this can even impact the structure of our brains. * If you find yourself feeling like you should just ""get over it,"" remind yourself that reality is more complicated that that. Traumatic events can actually change the way your brain works. This can take a long time to overcome, so cut yourself some slack and try to be patient. * Emerging research in neuroscience suggests that brains have a certain “plasticity.” Our genetic predispositions can be manipulated and expressed in unpredictable ways after powerful experiences. In other words, your brain can change. It is a product of both your genes and your experiences. * The physiological and psychological effects of past experiences can seem difficult to overcome and incorporate into your life. But, it’s important to keep in mind your body and brain are constantly reorganizing themselves based on new experiences. Your brain and body have changed before, and will change again. You can make that change a positive thing. 3. Accept that you cannot change what happened, only how you view it. You can't revisit the past, but you can change the way you perceive it and handle it from now on. If you don't, your hurt self will carry over this emotional pain into other new experiences and relationships. * Your efforts here should be directed toward accepting the past and forgiving those who may have wronged you. Allow yourself to feel whatever emotions you have about your past. Then, try to let those feelings go. * When you experience anger or sorrow about the past, try to remind yourself that hanging on to these negative emotions only harms you in the end. No amount of anger will undo what happened. Acknowledge your feelings. Then, look within for the compassion to forgive those who harmed you and the strength to let go. * This process will take time and will be different for each person. Other steps in this article are designed to help with the process. * Dwelling on the past can cause problems without any conscious desire on your behalf. 4. Try meditation or yoga. There are several activities called embodied physical practices that can help you make peace with the past. Meditation and yoga, for example, can help you develop personal coping techniques. These activities help you become more sensitive to the ways your emotions affect different parts of your body. * Yoga is best learned with the guidance of a professional instructor. If you've never tried it before check online to see if there are free or low-cost introductory classes offered in your community. Many places have affordable options you can use try yoga and see if its right for you. * Meditation is something you can easily do alone in your home. Find a comfortable place to sit with your legs crossed and your hands in your lap. Close your eyes and take slow deep breaths. Try to drive everything out of your mind but your breathing. There are cds you can buy and mp3s you can download that can help you focus and guide you through the process. * These practices give you the psychological time and space to identify particular emotions related to past experiences. In doing so, they can allow you to notice and work through the effects they’ve had on your behavior and thought processes. 5. Keep a journal. Write about the events in your day-to-day life, or about the past. These are great ways to work through difficult emotions. * Start off one night by simply listing the events you experienced throughout the day. You don't even need to force them into any sort of narrative. Try not to think too hard about it; keep your mind open and just write down whatever feels natural. This will get you comfortable with the process of journaling. * This should become easier with each day as it develops into a habit. At this point you can start writing about past experiences that come to mind during your writing sessions. * Focus on your thoughts and feelings. The important thing is to express yourself, not to tell a beautiful story. * Journaling about the upsetting events of your past can help you come to terms with them and make them less intrusive in your day-to-day life. Expressive writing like has both mental and physical health benefits. It can help you process your emotions, and can also help restore disturbed sleep patterns. * This kind of emotional work can take some time and introspection. But, it can be very productive if you let the process unfold on its own. 6. Spend time with other people. Unresolved past experiences can sometimes make it feel impossible to trust new people in your life. This can make it hard to build healthy relationships."	.

Buy or find some magazines that are nature themed and have autumn themed trees and animals. You can tell if the trees are autumn themed by looking at the leaves. They should be coloured red, gold, brown, magenta, yellow or even slightly blue. * You can try finding a nature magazine from an autumn month or week to find pictures of autumnal animals, plants and trees. 2. Cut out the best images of autumnal trees, animals and plants that you have found. Start thinking about roughly where you will put them. * You will be putting the trees in the background in your collage, so keep that in mind while planning it out. 3. Place and stick the trees into the background. They need to be in a row with the trunks 3/4 from the bottom of the page. * Try to have a range of different coloured leaved trees. A pattern of red and orange looks better than a row of one colour. 4. Paint the path under the tree trunks. Your picture should look like the trees are towering over the path and bursting in colour. * If your picture does not look like the trees are towering over the path, you may have placed them in a 'falling over position' by mistake rather than straight, which ruins the perspective. 5. Add in the animals and plants. The plants can go in front of the trees, and the animals can go in front of the trees or in the branches if it is a bird or climbing animal. * Don't get too carried away with the animals. You only need about ten of them. 6. Colour in the gaps between the trees blue as sky. The sky is not a blue strip across the sky. In pictures, it comes all the way down until it meets the ground. * If you don't have gaps in between the trees, don't worry. It is not a crucial part and you can skip this step. 7. Add some finishing touches. Maybe you could paint the path brown or give the tree trunks a sheen of brown acrylic paint. * Acrylic paint is best for this picture. Watercolor paint is too funny and any other paints do not have the same solid texture as acrylic paint. 8. Leave the paint to dry for twenty minutes. Acrylic paint drys very quickly, so you don't need to wait long. *	.

Make a simple syrup. The simple syrup should consist of two parts sugar and one part water. Heat the two ingredients together until the sugar is completely dissolved. Note, however, that the amount of simple syrup called for in this recipe is too small to make on its own, so you might need to make more than necessary. * To make simple syrup, begin by boiling 1/4 cup (60 ml) water in a small saucepan set on the stove over high heat. * Once the water is boiling, add 1/2 cup (120 ml) sugar to the pan. Stir well. * Stir the mixture constantly as it continues to boil and cook. When ready, there should be no visible grains of sugar left and the liquid should look clear. * Set aside 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of this simple syrup for your Dr. Pepper recipe. Save the rest in a sealed plastic or glass container stored in the refrigerator. 2. Caramelize the sugar. You caramelize sugar by heating it until it melts and turns brown. As with the simple syrup, the quantity called for in this recipe is too small to make on its own, so you might need to make more than required. * To caramelize sugar, begin by sprinkling 1/4 cup (60 ml) white granulated sugar on the bottom of a small, heavy saucepan. Spread the granules out so that they form an even layer. * Place the saucepan on the stove and heat it on medium. *	If you do not stir the sugar, some may burn before the rest has a chance to caramelize.
Make_a_Three_Point_Turn.txt	Inside_Revision	0.843	### Making a Three-Point Turn	1256	Since you will be going across the road , you need to turn on your left indicator .	### Beginning the Turn	1626	Because you will be going across the road , you need to turn on your left indicator .	<replace><Since><1><Because><1>	True	Making a Three-Point Turn  1. Choose a quiet area to practice. If you're just learning a three-point turn, pick an area that's free from traffic. Try an empty parking lot or a quiet road. 2. Make sure the road is clear. Look in both directions to make sure you have enough time to make a turn without a car running into you. In addition, pick a point in the road where drivers can clearly see you from a distance. That means you shouldn't make a three-point turn near a bend or the brow of a hill, as it can block you from the view of other drivers. 3. Make sure you have enough space to turn around. Usually, a two-way road is enough room to make a three-point turn. In addition, you shouldn't have enough room to make u-turn; if you do, you should do a u-turn, as it is quicker and therefore, safer. 4. Pull over to the right side of the road. Switch on your right indicator. Look in your mirrors to make sure no one is speeding up behind you. Also, tap your brakes to alert anyone behind you. Once it's safe to do so, pull over to the side of the road. Stop about half a foot from the kerb. 5. Switch on your left indicator.	Also, check again to make sure no one is coming on the road. You'll need at least twenty seconds to complete your turn, so make sure no one is coming too quickly.

Do 150 minutes of cardio each week. In addition to diet, another important part of your weight loss plan will be physical activity - especially cardio. Even within a 4 month time period, this type of exercise can heavily influence your weight loss. * Including regular amounts of cardio throughout the week will help support your weight loss. These activities raise your heart rate and can burn a significant amount of calories. * At a minimum, include 150 minutes or 2 1/2 hours of cardio or aerobic activities each week. This will give you the weight loss benefit but also many health benefits. * Include moderate cardio activities like: jogging/walking, dancing, cycling, taking an aerobics class or doing water aerobics. 2. Include 1to 3 days of strength training. In addition to cardio, it's also beneficial to add in regular strength training to your exercise routine. This type of activity can also support weight loss. * Participating in 20 minutes of strength training 1 to 3 times each week can help build lean muscle mass, prevent osteoporosis and increase your metabolism. * If you have increased lean muscle mass, your body is able to burn more calories at rest. Within 4 months, you can make a significant difference in your body's lean muscle mass and metabolism. 3. Increase lifestyle activity. Although increased cardio and strength training can offer many benefits to weight loss, increasing your lifestyle activity has been shown to be equally beneficial. Again, in a 4 month time period this extra activity can really effect your overall weight loss. * Lifestyle activities are exercises that you already do as part of your typical day. For example, taking the stairs, walking to and from your car, walking to go get the mail or doing household chores. * Many studies have shown that these activities are equally as beneficial to weight loss and overall health as planned or structured cardiovascular exercise. * Try to think of ways you can increase your overall exercise. For example, can you park farther away from your office? Can you schedule in a 10 minute walk break or yoga session on your lunch hour? Can you take more stairs? These activities will get you moving more and help burn more calories throughout the day. 4. Include 1 to 2 rest days a week. In the course of 4 months, you may make significant progress on your weight loss, but also on your physical fitness level.	.

Be hygienic. Take a shower once a day, preferably the morning because it can wake you up and be a treat, especially if it is cool. Wash your hair at least every other day. Also, find moisturizing shampoos and conditioners too if you have dry hair. 2. Get a cute haircut. All different lengths you can get. If you decide to get a short haircut, but don't get a blunt boys cut if you want to look feminine. Make your hair look wispy or flipp it out, or chunky with color. With long hair styles you want to have long hair and grown out bangs. Try a side swept layer look. Ask your hairstylist what would be suitable for you. Nothing difficult to maintain. 3. Moisturizing your skin is very important, it has the purpose of keeping your skin soft. Also a good face wash to use every morning would be appropriate. 4. If you can wear a small amount of make up wear it on special occasions such as going to a fancy restaurant, or an end of the year dance. Just a small amount of pastel colored eye shadow and some lip gloss, and maybe some mascara will be plenty. 5. Wear cute clothes. Ditch the grungy jeans and over sized sweater. Pick out a nice top every once in awhile or some fitted jeans. Fitted clothes will make you look better. 6. Have at least one cute pair of shoes. Something to dress it all up. Whether it is a boot, a sandal, a wedge, you pick it! But make sure it is appropriate for school. 7. During teen years there are a lot of barriers (things that go wrong). Like braces, glasses, acne, overweight, underweight, flat chest, and what not. Read the following tips on these barriers to feeling your beauty. 8. Try a bit of light perfume. Don't put on something too overpowering, though. Nice smelling soap can give of a perfume scent too. 9. Smile lots. A smile is a great accessory! 10. If you feel good and you look good, you are good. 11. Also, don't be too picky when looking at yourself. You might have something different than others so be happy with yourself. 12. Also, try sleeping on your back or side, not on your stomach. You'll feel a lot better! 13.	.

Make_a_Living_from_Teaching_Guitar.txt	Begin_Revision	0.863	## Steps	1415	But , there are other things to consider .	## Steps	1460	However , there are other things to consider .	<replace><But><1><However><1>	True	Steps  1. Start teaching immediately. Teaching is a skill best learned by experience and the sooner you start the better. Depending on your experience level, either start with friends and family members; teaching them for free, or offer to teach beginners for a modest rate (such as £10 per hour in the UK or $15 in the US). The classic mistake that many would-be guitar teachers make is to think that they have to “complete” learning the guitar themselves before they will feel ready to teach. The fact is that you can never complete learning the guitar – it’s just too big a subject.  * During this time, you should put together some teaching materials, like a list of beginner songs you can teach, along with print-outs of tabs and scales and exercises that your students can practice at home. 2. Study all you can on the subject of teaching guitar, all the while continuing to teach so that you build concrete experience that will help you make sense of what you are studying. This is by far the single most important factor to your success as a professional. The reason why it is easy for you to succeed in this business is because it is crammed to the gills with people who are not great at teaching. It’s not that they are bad people – it’s just that they haven’t realized that the job is not about being a great guitarist – it’s about being a reasonably good guitarist but a brilliant teacher! And, some great guitar players are terrible teachers, just like some great doctors have terrible bedside manner. 3. Start thinking of guitar teaching as a business. Set a goal for how much money you'd like to make per year from teaching guitar. Then research other guitar teachers in your area. See how much they charge, even if it means calling as a potential student. Find out what the going rate is, because that's about where you should start too. (As demand for your lessons grow, you can raise your rate.) Divide your annual goal by the rate you're starting off with, and that should be approximately how many lessons you need to give to meet your goal. (E.g. To make $20,000 a year charging $40 an hour, you need to give 500 lessons in a year, or about 42 lessons a month.)	This site may help you to gain some ideas: [

Wash your hands WELL with lots of soap. * If you have any cuts, eczema, or any similar skin problems on your hands you should wear gloves when cutting hot peppers. The burning from the oils won't go away with washing after a while. If you are dealing with many very hot peppers (and even some jalapenos can be quite hot) it is best to wear rubber gloves even if your skin is intact. By the time you notice your hands being burnt, it will be too late and you will be in for several hours of suffering. * This recipe does not give instructions on how to safely can or preserve the hot sauce, so it is best to keep it in your refrigerator for a week or two or in the freezer.	.

Wait for the cookies to cool. After the cookies have finished baking, take them out of the oven and transfer them to a cooling rack. Wait until the cookies are completely cool to do anything with them, otherwise, the frosting will melt. * Try making the cookies first, setting them on the rack to cool, and then starting on the frosting. By the time you finish the frosting, the cookies should be cool. 2. Spoon about a tablespoon of frosting onto each cookie. When the cookies are cool, you can begin to add the frosting filling. Use a small ice cream scoop or melon baller to scoop about a tablespoon of frosting onto the center of half of your cookies. * Don’t worry about spreading out the frosting or patting it down. Just scoop the frosting balls onto the cookies. 3. Place another cookie on top of the frosting. Next, you will need to place another cookie on the top of the frosting-topped cookies and press the two cookies together. This will cause the frosting to spread out and distribute evenly between the cookies. * Do this for all of your cookies until they are all sandwiched together. 4. Enjoy your homemade Oreos! After you have finished sandwiching your cookies, they are ready to eat! Enjoy them alone or with a glass of milk. * If you do not plan to serve the cookies right away, then you might want to place them in the fridge to help keep the frosting from melting. 5.	.
Make_Foam_Cosplay_Armor.txt	Begin_Revision	0.669	## Steps	99	And let it dry .	## Steps	119	Then let it dry .	<replace><And><1><Then><1>	True	Steps  1. Materials:* Craft foam (any color because it will be painted anyway, In this tutorial I used size 30 cm x 45 cm sheets)* 'Puffy Paint' 1.0 US FL OZ (any color because it will be painted anyway, also it doesn't have to be this exact brand, check your local supermarket for any type of 3-D/puffy paint) In this tutorial I bought my Puffy Paint from Wal-Mart for about 98 cents, I believe (you may want to buy more than one just to be safe)* 'Elmer's' Glue or any type of regular school glue* Hot glue/hot glue gun* Scissors* an Iron/heating gun/ stove/ or anything that you can use to get the craft foam hot to mold* Metallic paint the color of the armor you wish to make (in this tutorial I use metallic gold)* black paint if you want to get your armor looking aged or having a real looking effect* Paintbrushes (thick and thin) 2. You'll want to start out by laying down a newspaper or garbage bag so things don't ruin your carpet/table/place of working. Take your first sheet of craft foam and wrap it around your arm (or area of interest, in this tutorial I'm making gauntlets) and take a sharpie or pen to mark the height/length you want your piece of armor. You should end up with four marks (for height and width on both sides and top and bottom). Now cut out that piece. If you want to create layers on your armor (to create dimension) take your hot glue gun and cut out strips (not as tall as the base layer and hot glue them on). I'm sorry I don't have pictures of this step. 3. Now that you have the base of your armor ready you can do one of two things : 1.) take your armor and run your iron over it several times to make it warm and soft. Then form the foam around your arm (or place of interest) so that it takes that shape. You may have to iron it several times and form it several times until it actually stays. Just be patient and take your time. 2.) The other route would be to do the decoration/detailing of your armor now. Take your armor piece and, using a sharpie or pen, draw on the detailing you want to have on your armor. Then, proceed to taking your puffy paint and tracing it over the detailing you drew. The puffy paint usually takes about 4-5 hours to dry. When dry, you'll want to then use the iron on your armor and mold it then. For this tutorial, I went the first route and ironed the armor first. Then, once I liked the shape of the foam, I did the second route and finished the detailing with the puffy paint. Then I let it dry overnight. 4. Now that the armor detailing is dry, take your school glue and a thicker paintbrush and just cover the entire piece in glue.	(This is what'll give the armor a metal look and not look so much like foam).

Whatever the reasons for these people who leave the military must be replaced. An estimated 353,000 new recruits are welcomed by the U.S. Army. The army must attract qualified candidates and train them to be able to accomplish its mission. Recruiters play an important role in this process. Advertising is not enough to win recruits. These are the people who go and watch schools, communities, youth groups and where this can be achieved to maintain its strong numbers. Each branch of the armed forces used different criteria for the selection of its recruits. The common denominator is that they employ experienced enlisted personnel to sell their product. Military recruiter is an expert on and advocate for its product. Thus, he or she can provide every information, guidance, opinion and stories about the U.S. Army. They are mechanics, cooks, administrators, electricians or whatever you can name work within the group. They know the enrollment criteria and have good public relations skills 2. 2 Undergoing interview - Although most of the first interviews with recruiters occur in the recruiter's office, there are cases where the recruiter might suggest another venue. However, the best setting would be the recruiter's office. Meet with your recruiter to his own office gives you the opportunity to see for yourself its environment. Before the interview, your recruiters have asked you to bring more possibly a social security card, birth certificate, driver's license or high school diploma. You can start the process by providing you with your social security card. Dress appropriately for the day and know the company you are interviewing. Most information can be seen in their websites. Write down any questions you may have. 3. 3 Determine your eligibility recruitment - Addressing the moral demands of enrollment is easy as any law-abiding citizen is qualified to join the army. If you have any previous violations of the law (only minor cases can be tolerated) immediately reveals your recruiter. Always remember that you must disclose any law violations that you in details.	Waivers are not granted automatically. The recruiter can offer help for you receive a waiver. If a particular recruiter refuses to help you with the legal disclaimer, you can find another recruiter who can help you with your concerns. The level at which an exemption may be granted depending on the weight of the offense / s. The process can take some time depending on the level of the approval authority.

Also, try waking up your toes by trying to make them go apart and stretching them. Try doing anything that makes your feet warm enough, and your muscles not as tight, and a bit loose, ready for action. (You will feel if your muscles are awake). * Before doing any exercises, such as the splits, (or any kind of exercise), its important to warm up. So, when you do stretch, your joints and muscles will be relaxed and ready to improve. * When getting warmed up, it's easier to stretch and is more effective. * Also, you don't want to hurt yourself, because your muscles might not be awake, and when your joints aren't quite ready, you might sprain yourself, or over-stretch a muscle, which is very dangerous, especially to a ballerina. 2. After a proper warmup, you are ready to exercise! The first step is to increase the arch. You can do this by finding a low surface close to the ground. (Such as the bottom of a couch.) etc. * Find something that is close to the ground, somewhere you can put your feet under. * Carefully, with your knees bent, slide you toes under the opening. (Make sure to cover half of your foot.) * When your foot feels comfortable, SLOWLY unbend your knee. NOTE: be careful, if you don't feel the stretch, try moving your foot more in, or in a different position. * BE REALLY CAREFUL, AS WELL AS PATIENT! If you feel a stretch, that's okay.	This will stretch your arch greatly. (dont push yourself too hard, to prevent injury)

Ingredients: * Prep time: 1 h Cook time: 1 h 30 min Total time: 2 h 30 min * Yield: 40 cookies Difficulty: easy Recipe type: Dessert * Egg whites – from 3 eggs * Fine Sugar – 3/4 cups * Cashew – 1/2 cup [Optional] * Salt – a pinch 2. Step 1. Preheat the oven to 200 degree Fahrenheit ( 95 degree Celsius). Separate egg whites from 3 eggs. Please follow the rules mentioned strictly to achieve best results. When you separate the eggs and pour into the bowl, the bowl must be clean from grease/water. Egg whites will be easy to separate when they are cold. See to that you do not see even a speck of yolk in the separated whites. Do not use your finger into the whites to take any speck of yolk/shell. Use a grease-free spoon. Wait until the egg whites reach the room temperature. Once they reach room temperature, pour them in a wide and tall, grease-free dry vessel. Use a grease-free whisk and beat them with hand until they become frothy. 3. Step2.	Now beat the eggs with the electric beater (in low speed) until they become foamy. Continue to beat (about 3 minutes) until they form soft peaks. [Do not even imagine to beat the egg whites with hand. You definitely need an electric beater for this recipe].

Draw the line where it matters. Voicing your own desires clearly and early is central to minimizing backlash later. However, no matter how thorough you were at sharing your own expectations, you are bound to get interference on some aspects of your wedding. If it's really significant to you and your fiance, and your personal beliefs, don't budge if you're footing the bill. * For instance, a common point of contention involves one or both families wanting a religious or traditional ceremony when the couple wants modern and secular. Effectively handling this dilemma requires tact. You may have no interest in having a traditional affair, but it might help to ask your parents what aspect of a traditional wedding is important to them. * If it's being married by your family priest, and that's okay with you and your fiance', then make a concession. However, if your parents demand that you get married in a church and you dreamed of an outdoor wedding, you will have to let them down gently. Say, ""Mom, Dad, I understand how much you want us to be married in the church. We know it's tradition in our family. But, we're a new generation and we want to start new traditions. Since I was younger, I have envisioned my wedding being outdoors in the fall. Can you please support our decision not to get married at the church?"" 2. Allow them to become involved. Although it may sound counter-intuitive, involving the person who has the most expectations with your wedding plans can actually get them off of your back. The key is to make them believe they are helping you make decisions with what is going on. Keeping them in the loop on the small things allows you to make the decisions on the big details. * Take the person with you to help make small choices like table settings or interviewing DJs. Doing so will make them feel involved, and they may back off on inserting themselves into other responsibilities. 3. Give those who help the acknowledgement they deserve. Although you should only do something you and your fiancé are comfortable with, allowing someone who has helped you to have some input in your wedding-making process is quite courteous. Help can translate to time and effort or signing a check. * For example, if the bride's parents paid for the wedding (which is still tradition in many areas), you might sit down early on during the wedding planning and have them voice their expectations. You might say, ""Since you all are paying for the majority of the costs, do you have any specific details you would like to have included?"" * Once they have voiced their expectations, be sure to say ""So, is every decision besides the venue open for Patrick and I to decide?"" This settles any further disputes about who is dictating what moving forward. *"	This small gesture can prevent hard feelings from forming.

Find a place to live. This should be one of your biggest priorities when planning a move. When finding a new home, there are a lot of factors to consider. First, choose a location. Do you want to live work? Near where you socialize? Figure out what is important to you. Next, choose what sort of home works for you. Are you an apartment person? Or do you need a house? * At this point, you will want to decide whether or not you want a roommate. This option can be really great for those people on a budget. If you have a friend who also needs a place to live, this could be ideal. If you find a roommate another way, make sure to use common sense and be safe. 2. Shop for supplies. Your parents have likely supplied everything you need. When you prepare for your move, make sure to think about the everyday essentials you will need. Sure, you'll need furniture. But don't forget things like soap, drinking glasses, and cleaning supplies. Make a thorough list and hit the store! 3. Set up services. Once you find a place to live, ask your landlord which utilities you are responsible for. Contact providers in your area and set up accounts. You will want to make sure that your water, electricity, gas, and heat are all ready to go the day before you actually move int. You often have to put down a deposit if you're a new customer--factor that into your budget. 4. Explore the area. Spend some time walking around your new neighborhood. Make sure you know the location of the closest grocery store, pharmacy, and gas station. Take some time to figure out where the nearest park is, and explore the neighborhood restaurants. Have a friend go with you to make this even more of a fun adventure. 5. Change your address. Obviously, you'll need to let the post office know that you have a new address.	Notify your bank, your employer, and your school of your new address. You'll also want to notify friends and family members. You don't want to miss out on holiday and birthday cards!

Prospective and current employers, admissions officers, and public officials in general can easily get their hands on your profiles and judge your character and competence based on the the posts you make. With the exception of celebrities, artists, and writers, the average person has no real reason to post anything publicly. In fact, it's more risk than it's worth to do so most of the time. Everyone has posts that they regret or will end up regretting. This happens, perhaps, the most on Facebook. It's almost automatic for most people to grab their phones and post inane or cringe-worthy content to their Facebook profiles.	It's far too much work to scroll through your entire timeline changing privacy settings for each and every post. Well, there's a way to mass-change the privacy settings for all your old posts set to Public or Friends of Friends. See step 1, of which ever method you'd like to use, to begin.

They may have even done this before you mass-changed your privacy settings. Beware. * People who are tagged in the posts you've just changed the privacy settings on can still see those posts - as well as their friends! - even if you're no longer Facebook friends with the tagged person. You can only prevent them from seeing these posts by going to the posts individually and untagging the person. * When you complete this mass-change, your posts will be set to ""Friends."" You can not change them to anything more restricted, at least not through this process. * This process only affects posts that are set to Public or Friends of Friends. They do not impact posts with more restricted privacy settings. * If you don't want people to see posts you've been tagged in, only the person who originally posted it has complete control over it. You can only control who sees those posts by asking the poster to change the privacy settings, asking the poster to remove the post from Facebook, or by untagging yourself from the post."

Find the girl. Look through your Facebook and find a cute girl who seems fun, single, and lives in your area. Ideally, it should be someone who knows some friends of yours, someone from your school, or someone who is in your extended social circle. Don't pick a girl who is a complete stranger. Make sure she's not in a relationship, and if you can see her photos, look out for photos of a possessive-looking guy with his arm around her.center|550px 2. Friend her. If you're not friends with the girl yet, then you should ask her to accept you as a friend. Remember that a complete stranger will most likely not accept your friend request, and she may even be creeped out and block you. If you met the girl casually, then a friend request is okay, but if you just found her on someone else's profile and live on opposite sides of the country, it may be trickier to get her to accept your request. * If you met the girl briefly but aren't sure if she remembers you, you can send her a quick message along with your request. Don't come on too strong. Just say something like, ""I had fun talking to you at Mike's party last week."" * If you see a cute girl posting on one of your friend's walls, then try to join the conversation. See if you can make a comment that she would like and try to get her to talk to you. * Be aware that Facebook has a strict no-harrassment policy. If you send the girl a friend request and she doesn't accept it, leave her alone. Don't bombard her with aggressive messages, or she'll report you to Facebook and could get your profile disabled for good. 3. Check out her page. Once you're Facebook friends with the girl, you'll have access to her page, where you can find out a number of things about her, depending on how active she is on Facebook. The more you know about her before you begin really trying to pick her up, the easier it will be to talk to her and spark her interests. Pay attention to the following things: * See if you have any mutual friends. Check out your mutual friends or look through her photos to see who she hangs out with. If you recognize one of the people, you can bring it up later -- in a natural way. * Pick up on her hobbies. Go through her pictures, wall, and Facebook groups to see if you can tell whether she likes going to the beach, playing tennis, or just going to a lot of loud and crazy parties. * Check out her links. Does she link to the songs from Justin Timberlake's new album? Does she link to an article about Obama? See if you can pick up on more of her interests this way. * Read her posts. Read the posts on her timeline to see if you can learn what she thinks about work or school, who her favorite basketball team is, or even what she's doing for the holiday weekend. 4. Start communicating with her. Take it nice and slow. Don't send her a message telling her she's hot the second she agrees to be your Facebook friend. Instead, spend some time developing your Facebook friendships. First, like one of her statuses or photos if it's appropriate. Then, you can start commenting on her photos or statuses. Make sure she communicates back to you and likes your comments and that you're not having a one-sided conversation. * Find the right time to start a longer conversation chain through comments. If she keeps writing back to you, then she must like talking to you. * As your relationship grows, you can post a link on her wall to something you think she'd like. Only do this once and wait for her to reciprocate before you do it again. * Don't mention that you know what her interests are from stalking her page. Just try to mention something that you've realized you have in common and wait for her to respond. For example, if you know she likes the Lakers, post about them and wait for her to like your status. 5. Send her a message. Once you think she's really feeling you and you've developed your posting and commenting relationship, you can take it to the next level by sending her a message. Just send her a few lines about something that reminded you of her, or direct her to a link you think she'd like. You can be a little flirtatious, but don't overwhelm the girl.center|550px * Wait for her to respond. If she asks you questions, then she wants to keep the messaging thing going. * Message her back. Once you do this a few times, then you can take this as a sign that she wants to take it to the next stage. 6. Facebook chat with her. Once you've been messaging back and forth with the girl for a while, then you can start Facebook chatting with her to have a more normal conversation. Just remember that not everybody likes to Facebook chat or even uses it -- she could be logged on to Facebook on her phone or at work, and not even realize that you're chatting her until later because she uses it so infrequently. But if she's into chatting, this is a great way to build your relationship. * Flirt it up. Now's the time to kick it up a notch. If she seems into you, you can say, ""Hey, cutie,"" or ""You looked great in that pic you just posted."" Don't be too forward, but let her know you're into her. * Talk about your common interests, or the things you know she likes. Remember all those things you learned about her from her profile? They'll come in handy here. 7. Get her number (optional). You can message her and say that you really like talking to her and would like to talk to her over the phone. This may freak her out and make her feel like you're coming on to strong, or it could be the perfect way for her to get to know you better before agreeing to go out with you in person. Feel her out to see what you think would be best.center|550px 8. Ask her to meet up. Unless you're just flirting with the girl on Facebook for the fun of it, you probably want to meet up with her in person at some point. So, once you have a good messaging and chat relationship, just say something like, ""I really like talking to you over Facebook, so I have a feeling I'd like talking to you even more in person. Do you want to meet up some time?""center|550px * Keep it casual. Don't ask her out to a candle-lit restaurant. Ask her out for coffee or a drink. If she doesn't know you at all outside of Facebook and you don't have many mutual friends, she may be wary of this, so keep it in a public place and as chill as possible. * You can give her your number and wait for her to give you hers. * Have fun. If she agrees to meet up in person, then enjoy building a relationship outside of Facebook."	The beauty of Facebook is that you can pick up multiple girls at once.

Find your current will. You should get the most recent copy of your will and read it. Look through your papers or contact your attorney, who may have a copy. You want to understand exactly what you are changing, so read through the will. * Avoid trying to add a beneficiary by handwriting in a new name or crossing out an old name. This is a good way to actually revoke the entire will. 2. Identify the new beneficiary and alternate beneficiary. You should not only name a new beneficiary but also name one or more alternates. If the original beneficiary dies, then you can identify who should take the property next. * If you don’t name an alternate, then the property will pass according to your state’s “anti-lapse” statute. This law typically requires that the property pass to the descendants of the beneficiary. For example, if you left your car to your brother, then the car will pass to his surviving child. 3. Meet with an attorney. Before amending your will, you should meet with an attorney. He or she can advise you about whether you will need to draft an entirely new will or if you can just draft a “codicil,” which is an amendment. Call up your lawyer and schedule an appointment. * Generally, you can use a codicil if your will is fairly simple and you are naming only one or two new beneficiaries. * However, you might need to draft an entirely new ill if you have a complicated estate or are naming multiple new beneficiaries. Describe your situation to your lawyer and ask their advice. 4. Draft a codicil. A codicil is a fairly simple amendment to the will.	If you are in doubt, always consult with your attorney. A codicil should include the following:

Check, test and assemble the toy. Take your time. Read the manual and you won't have to worry about the children handling sharp tools from your toolbox, as you can actually assemble the toy before Christmas when they are in bed! Have a glass of wine or a cup of coffee and relax, the hard part - actually braving the Christmas crowds and buying the toy - is done. 3. If you have decided to assemble the toy well in advance of the big day, find a suitable hiding place. Perhaps the garage, your bedroom, or a relative or neighbour's home? 4. Invest in a 'Build n' Wrap' gift frame and put it together. Normally it's a simple push-fit assembly and no tools are necessary. Use the assembled toy to gauge the size you need. Attach your gift wrapping paper to the perfectly straight edges that the frame provides. Within minutes, you have a perfectly gift wrapped cube that looks great! 5. Wake up to excited children. Go down and see what gifts they have got. Don't worry about the time; no doubt it's early but you'll be able to relax soon enough. Watch them rip open the gift. It's just what they wanted and they can play with it right now, because you've already assembled it! Whether your toy needed an initial mains battery charge, assembly, or was just a really difficult shape to wrap, you'll be sorted. 6. Let children enjoy playing with toy for a time. It's fun when they first get the gifts. But then to stop boredom and wandering, have them help gather up the wrapping paper and put it in the recycling bin.	If they whine, tell them they can return to their toys when they have finished helping out.

Pull your weight with household chores. If you want your parents to see that you'd be a great dog owner, then you have to be able to do the basics: make your bed, keep your room clean, wash the dishes, and do anything that is required of you. Then, take it to the next level -- pick up more household chores, help cook dinner, mow the lawn, do laundry, or do whatever you can to go above and beyond what is required of you.center|550px * Don't be smug about how much housework you're doing. Let your parents notice your efforts on their own. 2. Keep your grades up. If you want your parents to see that you can handle the added responsibility of a dog, then you should make sure to keep your grades up as you continue to ask to add a new member to your family. If you can, try to do even better in school to show them that you're committed to working hard and doing whatever it takes to get the dog.center|550px 3. Show them that you can take care of something. Have your parents give you something to take care of for a set amount of time. It can be an egg, a sack of flour, a plant, or a hamster. Doing well on this test run may show your parents that you're responsible and serious about wanting a dog. Treat the situation with the utmost seriousness.center|550px 4. Do a ""test run."" If you have a friend or family member who needs someone to take care of his or her dog for a little while, you should take them up on their offer. Taking in the dog for the weekend or a few days will show your parents that you're ready to take on a pet, and it will make them see how happy you are to be hanging out with a furry pal.center|550px * Let them see how cute the dog is and have them fall in love with the idea of having a dog a little bit. Send them pictures of a particular dog breed you want, it is hard to resist a adorable puppy. 5. Get a part-time job if you can. Depending on your age, you can get a part-time job or just finding a small way to make money will help your parents see that not only will you be able to handle some of the expenses of having a dog, but also that you're able to take on added responsibility.center|550px * You can even have a tin can for your money that you call your ""dog fund."" 6. Give them time to think about it. If they say no, understand and keep being helpful in the house."	Being patient will also show them that you're so committed that you're willing to wait.center|550px

You can also find suggestions on how to keep your dog from chewing your shoes and clothes. Be prepared to get them appropriate toys to chew. * When your parents say that you cannot have a dog, don't shout at them or get angry. Be nice and smile, but keep persevering. * Take the Dog Breed Selecting test on www.AnimalPlanet.com. It's free and helps you pick the right dog for your family. www.Petfinder.com also has a search engine to research and find rescue dogs in your area. * Offer to pay for the dog yourself. This will show that you want one enough to spend your own money on it, and that you won't think of it as just another toy to play with until you get bored. * While you are waiting for your parents approval, here are some other ways to be around dogs: find out where the animal shelters are in your neighborhood and go volunteer there to help take care of some homeless dogs or find neighbors who need help around with their dogs. * Try to get a dog breed that would make your parents say yes.	.

Use facts over emotions. Back up your points with data and concrete examples. Don't just tell your boss that you want a raise. Talk about your leadership positions within the company, job expenses (like gas or parking tickets), and projects you've completed under your boss' supervision. 2. Listen to your boss carefully. Just as you want your boss to hear your perspective, listen to their thoughts with an open mind. If your boss says something you initially object to, put yourself in their shoes and try to understand their opinion. Active listening helps build respect and foster mutual understanding in tough conversations. * Acknowledge your boss's objections to validate their opinion and frame yourself as agreeable. 3. Focus on where you and your boss agree. Building common ground can help your boss gain empathy for your situation. Basing your points on both of your shared experiences can make your argument seem more reasonable. * If your boss is a mother and you're asking for paternity leave, for example, explain how you want to be there for your wife and child for the first few weeks. 4. Ask your boss questions.	This can aid in understanding their position, clarifying any confusion, or even shift them towards your interests.

Foot position. * Set up with your back foot off the tail of the board with just your big toe in the pocket. This is exactly the same position as the regular pressure flip. This trick is almost all in the big toe of back foot, so this step is pretty important. * Your front foot can be wherever it is comfortable, I normally have mine just under the bolts at an angle. Make sure your heel is hanging off as it makes it easier to get the ""No Comply"" part down more easily. 2. Doing the trick. * When you're rolling and you feel ready to execute the trick, position your feet as describe in the step above. If you're not used to pressure flips it will feel really awkward at first because your back foot should be at a weird angle. * Slide your front foot off the board onto the ground and plant it there. This causes the board to pop, either vertically or diagonally if your back foot is in the correct position. * When the board pops, scoop under and push forward with your back foot. Remember only your big toe should be used to pop the board, the rest of your back foot should be off. This doesn't require much effort, just a little nudge. *"	Once you scoop the board jump up with your back foot and wait for it to do a full rotation, it should spin like an Inward Heelflip.

Do things that will start to break the ice. This helps start off the relationship. If they don't want you sitting with them, don't ask ""why not?"", just say okay and politely say goodbye and walk away. Don't be offended by this. They might have a full table or plans to sit with somebody else. Its okay if this happens, just find another person and start over. 3. Start a conversation with them. Ask about their interests, classes they have, some people they hang out with, what sports they're in, etc. This should branch off of the introduction. Ask more about their classes. ""Who's the teacher?"" ""What are you learning?"" More things to break the ice. 4. Ask if he/she would like to hang out with you. Ask if they would like to hang out at the mall or go see a movie. Don't ask them to sleepover right away because you'd be moving too fast. Ask to do something simple and it'll let you get a chance to learn more about each other. If they say no, thats okay. Just say, ""Oh okay, maybe another time then maybe?"" If this happens, get to know them a little bit more before you proposition them again. 5. Ask if he/she would like to sit with them next time in school. If you like the person and share interests, its always nice to sit with them again and become more closer. If they say no, then its a hint that they don't like you much. Say ""Oh okay."" and try not to say much after that. 6. Walk each other to class. Talk along the way and if you happen to be in the same class, thats great! If not, say ""oh you have this class? I have this now."" They might ask more about it, and thats okay- whatever keeps the conversation going. Make sure you're not late for class, though. 7.

Repeat these steps with each person, and continue to talk to everybody to get to know them better. 8."

Make sure your tires are fresh and properly inflated to prevent a wicked wipeout going downhill at . * Check the condition of your cables. Often damp weather causes corrosion which can interfere with shifting and overall performance. * Check the wear on the drive chain. Poor lubrication and lack of cleaning may cause wear can also affect shifting. * Make sure your cleats and pedals are in good condition. Walking in cycling shoes wears down the cleats so they don’t bond to the pedals as well. 3. Make sure you’re outfitted with all of the necessary gear. This includes a strong helmet, high visibility jersey, water bottles, sunglasses, cell phone, and snacks like Powerbars are great to stick in your jersey pockets. And don’t forget the all important tire repair kit and micro pump; the question isn’t “if” you’ll get a flat, it’s “when”. 4. Make sure to get in plenty of carbohydrates and water before the race. Carbs stored as glycogen in your liver are crucial to your athletic performance. Not to mention you need the carbs throughout the race to maintain adequate blood glucose levels.	With profuse sweating you’ll find yourself needing to drink a lot more water.

Ready your stance. When you’re up to bat, it is not enough to just stand at the plate. There are a few very important batting stance tips to keep in mind every time you go up to hit. * Keep your feet shoulder-width apart and even. Don’t stagger your feet so one is further back or forward than the other. * Bend your knees and lean forward on your feet into the “ready position.” Your back should not be going straight up and down, but should have a slight forward tilt. * Put your weight on your back foot. When you swing, you will push off using your back leg to give you power. * Back the appropriate distance from the plate. To know how far you should be, stick your bat straight out in front of you perpendicular to your body, as if you were in full-swing. Back up or move closer to the plate so that the barrel of the bat is centered over the plate. 2. Hold the bat in the right position. When you pick up the bat, you should be holding the rubber grip near the end. Your hands should never rest against the base of the bat or touch the metal at the top, but should rest somewhere between the two. * Line up your knuckles on the handle of the bat, and make sure your hands are touching together. * When you hold the bat up, it should never be pointed directly up, down, or horizontal in the air. instead, hold it at a slight angle upwards past your shoulder. * Make sure you are holding the bat far enough back, with your hands parallel to your ear. 3. Prepare to swing. make sure you are still in the right position, with the bat held properly above and behind you and your knees bent. 4. Swing to hit the ball. When you swing, keep your bat level and avoid reaching for the ball. Always wait for a good pitch, as swinging at a ball can either give you a strike if you miss or a bad hit if you make contact. * When you swing, remember to do so “shoulder to shoulder.” This means that your chin starts out directly above or resting on your dominant shoulder, and you swing all the way around so that it ends on your opposite shoulder. * Swing hard with a strong follow-through.	Use all your strength and swing the bat all the way around your body.

Prepare to gather everything into one 'place'. While this will be an ongoing project, beginning it is the hardest step. Ultimately, you will need all your photos to be in one place, ideally backed up on one hard drive or in one account on the 'cloud'. But first, you need to get all of the actual images or files together. * Collect them from wherever you can. You may have hard copies at home or in relatives' houses, you may have them stored in albums, or you may have them uploaded to various web sites, like Flickr, SmugMug, Facebook, or Instagram. * Dig up any CDs, thumb drives, or hard drives that might have images on them. Use your File Management system to get them all in one place. Speed wise, parking your data on your hard drive is going to be the most convenient. * Check any online photo/file storage accounts that you have. You could have set your phone to back up to any, or all, of them to the cloud. You might have some on , Amazon Photos, , , or . 2. Come up with a naming scheme. Ideally, do this before you start moving files or scanning photos, so that you can use it as you go. It will need to be something that is easy to remember and duplicate. Be sure that you are consistent. * You can be fairly broad or fairly specific, depending on your needs and knowledge: * 1952 Lola Shane Family * 1950s Lola Shane Family (useful for if you aren't really sure of the year) * 1900s Shane Family (useful if you aren't sure which part of the family or which century, for that matter. This happens with very old photos.) * The year being first is very important for ordering your images. Just throwing them in a folder doesn't work. The more images you have identified by time/year, the easier the organization will be. 3. Determine some basic categories for the organization. You will have a lot of sub-categories, but you will need some very broad, basic categories. * Depending on what's in your collection, these might include: * Individual years * Decades, e.g. 1960s, 1970s * Locations * People * Flora * Fauna * Themes are a great way to categorize images, but they are probably more effective when tagging your photos. 4. Gather all your images on one harddrive. If you haven't already, download all those images you found in the cloud and on your social media and photo storage accounts.

Paint_a_Radiator.txt	Begin_Revision	0.673	### Priming and Painting Your Radiator	309	Once the primer has dried completely , it 's time to paint the radiator .	### Priming and Painting Your Radiator	380	After the primer has completely dried , it 's time to paint the radiator .	<replace><Once><1><After><1>|||<replace><dried><5><completely><5>|||<replace><completely><6><dried><6>	True	Priming and Painting Your Radiator  1. Cover the walls and floor around the radiator with a drop cloth. Lower a drop cloth or some large pieces of scrap paper behind the radiator and secure them to the wall with a piece of painters tape. Repeat the same process, working outwards from the radiator, until you have an area that covers at least in all directions from the radiator. * You should cover as much area around the radiator as you can, as the aerosolized spray paint will travel much further than you may expect. It’s much easier to put up drop cloths or paper than it is to repaint a whole wall! 2. Ventilate the area as much as possible. Both spray paint and spray primer can be very dangerous if inhaled, or if you are working in a space without proper ventilation. Open as many windows as you can in the room that you are working in to keep air circulating, and wear a ventilator mask and gloves for extra safety. * If you begin to feel light-headed at any point during the painting process, it may be a sign that there is not enough ventilation and that you are inhaling the fumes. Stop painting immediately and call a professional to paint the radiator safely. 3. Choose oil-based primer and paint that can resist high temperatures. When working with something like a radiator, both the paint and the primer you use will need to be oil-based and resistant to high heats. Ask at your local hardware store to find spray paints and primers that are oil-based, resistant to heat up to , and in the color you want. * Make sure that the color you choose for your radiator will work with the color of the wall that it is against. Try and find a color in a similar shade to make it blend in, or choose a contrasting color to make your radiator stand out a little more. 4. Spray the radiator with an even coat of primer. Hold your can of spray primer roughly from the radiator and press down firmly on the nozzle. Use a back and forth motion to coat the radiator in a single even layer, making sure to get in and around all of the individual blades. 5. Leave the primer to dry for up to 24 hours. It may take a lot of time for your coat of primer to dry completely. The primer will need to be dry to the touch and not sticky at all before you begin painting, so make sure you give it plenty of time. Check the manufacturer's instructions on the primer for specific advice if you're unsure how long your primer will take to dry. 6. Coat your radiator with a single layer of spray paint.	Follow the same method as applying the primer to evenly coat the top of the radiator. Work across each of the blades, painting one side of all of them before finishing with the other side. Use short, sharp bursts of paint to touch up any exposed areas and let the paint dry.

Know your starting hands. When you’re starting your initial round of betting, it’s important to know whether or not the hand you have is worth playing. In Texas Hold’em, you have two cards to start, and you’ll need to decide if you should play them or fold. * Hands to raise: Pairs of tens, face cards or Aces are almost always a good hand to raise with. An Ace and a King or an Ace and a Queen are strong hands as well. If you have these hands, bet before the flop to raise the value of the pot. * Hands to call pre-flop: An Ace with a face card, or two consecutive face cards of a different suit are strong hands to call with. Two consecutive non-face or face cards of the same suit can work in your favor. Low pairs should call to see the flop to see you luck to make two pair, a high kicker, or a full house, but not raise (they give less value, less likely to win, on average than higher pairs). 2. Know when to hold and when to fold. The key to being successful at poker is knowing when to fold your hand and accept a smaller loss, or when to hold onto it and risk a larger loss knowing that you have a good chance to win the pot. If the flop comes and you’re holding a hand that doesn’t play, check and fold. You don’t want to keep betting money at a hand that won’t win. If the flop comes and you have a strong hand, bet at it. This will force weaker hands out and raise the value of your pot. * If your hand could play if the right cards come up, then you’ll want to determine if it’s worth holding out for them. Calculating pot odds can go a long way towards helping you make these decisions. * Pot odds are calculated by determining the percentage chance that you have to draw the card you need. To calculate them, count the number of outs you have. These are cards that will improve your hand. Multiply the number of cards times two, then add 1 to get the percentage. For example, if there are 10 cards in the deck that could improve your hand, you have about a 21% (10 x 2 + 1) chance of getting a card you need. * Next, you’ll need to determine if it is worth betting. Calculate the pot+bet, which is the pot total plus the bet to call. So if the pot is $120, and the bet to call is $20, then the pot+bet is $140. Multiply your percentage of your outs with the pot+bet. In the previous example, a 21% chance with a pot+bet of $140 would look like 0.21 x 140 = 29.4. This means you should call bets lower than %29 of the pot, or around $40. * Working out the pot odds is only a guideline and doesn’t take a lot of variables into account. Use it as a basis to judge the worthiness of a hand. 3. Understand the psychology. Playing your opponent is arguably more important than playing your cards in poker. You have to be able to read what your opponent is doing, as well as trick them into not knowing your plan. * Don’t let emotions cloud your judgment. You will lose hands, it’s guaranteed. Don’t let setbacks affect your attitude and playstyle. * Change up your pace. If you’ve been playing your cards close, and not betting wildly, start bluffing a bit more. If you’ve been bluffing, go back to playing tighter. Switching often will keep opponents from being able to predict your actions and guess your cards. * Read your opponent. Adjust your playstyle to your opponents’. Look for players that are betting carelessly, and try to trap them. Learn to see the tells, which can give you an estimation of their hand. Some basic tells: a hand over the mouth is usually concealing a smile; shaking hands is nervous, but that could be a good nervous or bad nervous; if a player glances at his or her chips when the flop comes, they probably have a strong hand; if a mediocre player is staring at you, he or she is likely bluffing. 4. Think on your feet. Don’t get bogged down with systems, react to situations as they arise. Every poker situation is different because of the human factor. 5. Plan your bankroll accordingly. When you are learning, you should never invest more than what you would consider “fun” to lose. Don’t add to your bankroll after losing everything you’ve invested. Wait until you are comfortable losing that amount again. *	The general rule of thumb is you should be able to afford to lose 200 bets at the highest limit. So if the limit is $5 bets, then your bankroll should be $1000.

To start familiarizing yourself with the different hands, print out a cheat sheet (such as the one linked at the top of this page) and study it. Knowing the different hands will help you determine whether your hand is good enough to bet on, or if it’s time to bluff or fold. * The highest-ranking hand is a “royal flush.” This hand includes a 10, Queen, King, and Ace of the same suit. * A ""straight flush"" is made up 5 consecutive cards of the same suit. * ”4 of a kind"" means you have 4 cards of the same rank and a fifth card of any rank. * A ""full house"" contains 3 matching cards of 1 rank and 2 matching cards of another rank. * A ""flush"" contains any 5 cards of the same suit.

Apply only a dime's worth of shampoo, more of conditioner, and massage it into your hair, working through the roots and the ends. Massage your scalp and rinse your hair throughly. When you apply the conditioner, make sure you let it sit in your hair for 3-5 minutes. When you rinse it out, your hair should be clean. 2. Apply gel. Applying gel before and after your shower will make your hair smooth and soft and good-smelling. Squeeze some of the gel onto your hand and rub it together until it completly covers the palm of your hand. Massage it carefully into your hair. Run the pads of your fingers through your hair so that the gel can get into every strand and lock of your hair. 3. Dry your hair. Lightly pat the top of your head with a towel to get your hair nice and dry. Avoid rubbing the towel all over your head. Your hair will get all tangled and snarled. Lightly squeeze your hair to get some of the water out of it. But, be careful. If you squeeze too hard, you can damage your hair. 4. Brush it out and dry it. Use a hair dryer to dry your hair. As you dry your hair brush it out with a pointy comb. Start by combing it at the top of your head to the little strands at the bottom.	.

Personal acceptance: When you catch yourself being critical of yourself, or comparing yourself negatively to another, this is due to low self esteem. Low self esteem can be the result of a person's opinion of themselves, or a result of negativity from outside sources. It takes time, but when you have these feelings, you have to find something or some person or place to refocus your attention in a positive manner. 2. Negativity towards others: When we have negative feelings because of an action(s) of another person, ask yourself why you are reacting that way. Use that situation as a challenge to see if you could give it a positive spin, or at the very least, curb the negativity that arises. We run into plenty of such opportunities in our daily lives. 3. Walk in another's shoes: When you cannot justify your negative feelings, try understanding where they are coming from. Put yourself in their shoes to understand why they did or didn't do it. Realize you cannot always change others. Change yourself by learning to see other person's point of view. 4. Ignore other people's weaknesses: Feel insulted by what the other person said? You probably have won the battle already, because by needing to insult you, the other person has put his weakness on display. Now win the war, by ignoring that weakness and moving on. 5. Give others the benefit of a doubt: Subjected to a joke you didn't like? Laugh at it with others. Maybe they did it because they like you, or they didn't realize it would hurt you. Give them the benefit of doubt.	.

Switch your old card out for a “chip card.” Although most people call them “chip cards,” they’re technically called EMVs, (which stands for Europay, Mastercard, and Visa). These cards contain computer chips within the card itself. That makes it much harder to counterfeit, making it more secure. * Your bank or card issuer will probably send you an EMV card without you even having to ask. But you might be able to speed up the process by making a specific request. 2. Take commonsense precautions. Just because you have a new chip card doesn’t mean you’re in the clear with respect to fraud. Although most retailers were required to make the switch to EMV readers in 2015, most self-payment terminals don’t have to make the switch until 2016 or 2017. *	Right now, using your card as debit is a little more dangerous than using a card as credit, because of PIN overlay devices that can capture PIN numbers.

Stray from your daily commute: Everyone have a fixed route they take every day to work, and back home. Everything is counted and calculated. Try and get down from the bus (or whichever public transport you use) couple of stops before yours, and walk down the remaining distance. This will not only give a chance to take a glimpse of your neighborhood, which you might have missed exploring all these years, but also you will get an idea about how much you can cover on foot. 2. Explore a nearby city for a day: Weekends are your day offs, time to relax, chill out with friends, movies, spending time with family; all understood! But why not take a short trip, in the coming weekend, to one of the close by cities and spend a day alone. Give yourself time to explore the city, the people there, the streets, whatever you think you need to know about that place, which you never bothered knowing earlier. 3. Go on a local day hike: If your trip destination is into the hills, this is one of the best ways to kick-start your preparations. Take a day off from all your routine works, get your back pack ready (snack, water bottles, medication box, etc.), and leave for the nearest hill for a day’s hike. This will be a kind of simulation training. 4. Do a lone activity: Eating out all by yourself can get really sad for some, that’s understood! But since you will be heading for a solo trip, you may have to face this situation during your trip. Go out and indulge in one or the other activities, you generally do with friends or family. Watch a movie in the theatre, have a fine gourmet meal, attend a fair; get used to doing things without someone accompanying you. 5. Try approaching random people: So you approached the girl, you were infatuated with, and things turned out…. well, let say, not so good! Don’t let your college incidences haunt you for the entire life. Try and approach people and see if you can initiate some conversation. Now, asking the direction for the nearest restaurant isn’t going to offend anyone, would it? 6. Try the Share and Care routine: While on your journey, there will be times when you will have to share the space with other travelers. So if you have been in a habit of having your own room, own bed, own shower; well, that’s going to go for a toss here. Make a stay over at one of your friends’ place and see how you take the sharing concept. Get used to it! 7. Know everything about the destination: Just dropping at the decided destination, without doing a thorough study about the place, is always a bad idea; especially when you are travelling alone. It is always beneficial to know a thing or two about the city or the country you are planning to take a trip to. This will help you filter the spots you would want to see, once you are there, and will save time. 8. Keep a track with multiple tracking tools: Always keep a map when travelling alone; the best way to know the routes and directions. Of course, the Google maps on your phone will come handy too, but keeping few navigating tools along makes the journey smoother.	.

Apply the oil. Once you have properly cleaned your saddle, use a soft rag to gently apply a light coat of oil to the grain (smooth or outward facing) side of the saddle. Rub the oil in a circular motion to get an even application. This will help you avoid spotting. You can also use your hand to apply the oil if you find some hard to reach places. * Avoid using any heavy oils, like olive or neatsfoot oil. Follow the manufacturer’s recommended oil or conditioner. * Make sure the oil is warm (at most 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius), but not hot. Hot oil can cook your leather and ruin it. * Some saddles require few oilings, and a few never need to be oiled. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s guidelines before you condition your saddle. * Avoid applying oil to the flesh side or any rawhide parts of the saddle. This will cause them to loosen and stretch out. 2. Let the saddle sit. Once you have covered the grain in oil, let it sit for an hour. This will allow the oil to soak into the leather. Keep the saddle in a dry and climate controlled location. Avoid placing it in direct sunlight. * If you are oiling the saddle for the first time, you may want to let it sit overnight. 3. Wipe off excess oil. After the saddle has sat for an hour, take a rag and wipe off any excess oil. You should also buff the saddle as you wipe off the excess, rubbing in a circular motion. This will help prevent any spotting or discoloration in the leather. 4. Repeat the process. If you are oiling your saddle for the first time, you may need to condition it at least three times over the course of a couple of weeks. You may want to pay particular attention to the fenders and the seat, which will need a little help loosening up. * Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s guidelines when oiling your saddle. Over conditioning, the saddle can make it too loose and ruin it. * Because they are used regularly, you may want to apply more oil to the fenders. * The seat may need some extra oil to make it form to your bottom. 5. Apply a conditioner.	This will help treat the leather and prevent it from drying out. Simply apply a small amount of conditioner to a rag and gently rub it into the leather.
Make_the_Weekend_Seem_Longer.txt	Begin_Revision	0.957	## Steps	4614	When you see events in the paper that interest you , cut them out and pin them to the calendar and plan to go .	## Steps	4680	If you see events in the paper that interest you , cut them out and pin them to the calendar and plan to go .	<replace><When><1><If><1>	True	Steps  1. Wake up at your usual time, or earlier. The biggest mistake is to assume that the weekend is great for a sleep-in. When you do this, you not only get your body out of sync, you have just kissed goodbye to precious time that can be put to better use. Go to bed earlier if you're exhausted Friday night, and sleep in on the odd Saturday when you really are thoroughly shredded, but don't sleep into your weekend on a regular basis. 2. Do the chores first. Nobody wants to do the chores and very few people get a thrill out of cleaning, washing the clothes, and vacuuming. But it has to be done. So the earlier you do it on the weekend, the better. Set aside a time, say 7am - 9am Saturday morning to just do it and get all available hands on deck to help. You'll feel a huge sense of relief when it is done and it clears the way for the rest of the weekend. This is also the time to add the special food to the marinade, or to thaw it, or to get it started cooking. 3. Get the grocery shopping out of the way too. If you can, try to grocery shop one weeknight. That is one less thing to worry about then. If not, add it to the early Saturday morning chores list and have it done by 10am before a lot of other people are even getting out of bed and considering doing it. Always avoid afternoon grocery shopping on weekends - that is when everyone else is doing it too and you'll be waylaid in traffic, have a hard time finding ideal parking spots, and you'll be in queues in the shops. That is just a waste of your time. Use the grocery time to catch up on haircuts, vet appointments, and to collect the dry-cleaning too. 4. Set aside time to do bill payments and other regular chores. Instead of having paperwork hanging over you like a dark cloud all weekend, set aside a specific time when you will sit down and deal with this. If you have time on a weeknight to do the paperwork, this is a good way to move it out of the weekend. If not, add it to the chore times, or allocate the time somewhere that it won't interfere with enjoying weekend activities. 5. Plan to do things. Weekends feel longer if you get out and enjoy them. Mark events to do on your calendar.	Consider what it is you, your family, your friends etc. like to do together and organise in advance:

Make absolute sure to check the weather. You don't want to pack sweaters and jeans to find out that the weather that week will be warm! Check the weather on a website (a good idea is The Weather Channel) and type in where you are going in the forecast box. 2. Pack items that will occupy you. Some good ideas are, Books, Video game devices, iPods, Cell phones, etc. You never know when you will get bored during that trip! 3. Remember a bathing suit just in case you go swimming. Even if you are going to a place with cold weather, bring one in case you were to go to an indoor pool. 4. Bring some money! A big travel mistake is forgetting money, and not being able to buy souvenirs or gifts. If you bring any, be careful with it. Carry it in a pocket, or even stuff it in your shoe if you are visiting a busy city like New York City, Las Vegas, Chicago, etc. If you're in a place where it's not so likely that you will get mugged, just put it into a handbag and make sure to be cautious. 5. If you want to bring something that is important to you, make sure to pack it. If you have a special item that is important to you at home, don't say, ""I don't think I'll need it,"" then you end up wanting the item. Just bring it if it's special to you. 6. Teeth care. You need to brush your teeth! Bring a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash (if you use mouthwash) and a bottle of water, for rinsing. 7. Hair Care. What do you use for your hair at home? Well, bring it with you. Hairbrush, Shampoo & Conditioner, and ponytail holders are definitely things that you should bring with you. 8. Body Care. Make sure to shower during this trip! No need to be greasy or smell bad. Shampoo, Conditioner, Deodorant, Body wash, Body spray, and soap are the main body care items that you will need during the five days, but bring any other body care items that you may use. 9. Sleeping Supplies. Where will you be sleeping? Most likely you won't be needing to worry about a sleeping bag and pillow unless you are going camping. No matter where you go, you will need pajamas. But bring whatever sleeping supplies you may need depending on where you are going. 10. Weather Supplies. In case it rains, bring a jacket of some sort."	.

Will you be traveling through many parts of the Caribbean or simply enroute to your final destination where you will enjoy the majority of your trip? As many of you may still be researching the perfect Caribbean destination, we have some pointers that will help you in your efforts. There are many that offer excellent ""destination guides"" as part of their website. These include the likes of the travel giants Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz. In addition, there are location specific travel brochures that one may request free of charge. Please access these highly informative guides through both the Lonely Planet's Caribbean Island destinations,as well as American Express's Caribbean electronic brochure.This free guide will help you in all facets of your research efforts towards making your own Caribbean travel itinerary. 2. List of popular Caribbean destinations: Antigua - Anguilla - Aruba - Outer Islands Bahamas - Bay Islands, Honduras - Bermuda, North Atlantic - Barbados - Bonaire - Grenadines - Curacao - Grand Cayman - Cancun, Mexico - Isla Mujeres, Mexico \- Cozumel, Mexico - Roatán Nevis - Martinique - Jamaica - Puerto Rico \- Guadeloupe - Grenada - St. Vincent - Tobago - Dominican Republic - St. Martin/St. Maarten - St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands - St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands - St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands - Tortola, British Virgin Islands - St. Lucia - St. Kitts – Tobago - Turks & Caicos 3. When To Go. You can enjoy a dramatically discounted ""summer"" by visiting the islands during the lengthy low season, mid-April to mid-December. Prices of hotels fall by 40% or more, package deals are common and popular port towns are far less crowded this time of year. the downside is many of the more popular resorts close their doors during this off-season. In addition, the trade winds aren't as prevalent in in summer, so the chance of encountering oppressively muggy weather is higher. Summer is also the hurricane season, particularly bad in August and September, when some hotels, restaurants and shops close for the month. If your primary interest is in the culture of the islands, this can be an ideal time to visit. 4. Costs & Money. If your Caribbean dream vacation includes hiking through a rain forest, snorkeling along corolful coral reefs, exploring Mayan ruins and sunbathing along the miles of pictureque white sand beaches -- you will find it all here, but paradise does have its price. The cost of living is relatively low on most Caribbean islands, but by the time you add up your expenses for activities, lodging, meals, transportation and a little nightlife, a Caribbean vacation could cost more than you might expect. And don't forget the shopping! We suggest that you write a chart out with all these facets of travel in order to realistically plan your Caribbean trip. By doing this you will have a clearer picture on what areas you can save money on."	.

Books can cover a wide range of topics on your tarantulas and maybe cover something you've missed. You can never do enough research on tarantulas. * Try to purchase a female tarantula.They usually live longer then the males. Some species of tarantulas can live up to 30+ years but the males might only live 2-5+ years. * Make sure you know the Latin name for your species of tarantula. Many tarantulas share common names so you might think you have one species when you really have another. Latin names or scientific names only apply to one species of tarantula and make research much easier. * Try to find captive breed tarantulas. Many pet stores only sell wild caught tarantulas because people like to start with large tarantula (small spiderlings are not as eye catching as a 6"" Chilean Rose. It takes a long time for a tarantula to grow and requires a lot of attention, so large captive bred tarantulas are not common in pet stores."	.

Enjoy your life as much as you can and make the best out of every situation. If you are truly happy, then other people won't be able to bring you down with their judgements. Finding happiness is the definition of success in life. * Worrying solves nothing - if it's that big a deal, make a plan and fix whatever it is that is bugging you. * Love yourself. Realise that everyone has good and bad qualities, including you - those who emphasise their good qualities are generally more lovable. You can be too. * So maybe you don't have many friends now - when you're older and people aren't so immature, you'll find some. * Take the road that's less travelled on. Odds are you'll gain so much more and still be able to walk the well trodden path. * If you want people to know you are not shy, then stare intently at them. If you want them to know you are relaxed and carefree, glance every now and then at their eyes. * Remember that the whole point of this article is to show others you are proud of yourself and you don't care what people perceive you as. You will gain high respect for being yourself and not trying to attach yourself to a group. * People want a reaction. If you ignore them, they will realize it's no fun to taunt and make fun of you. Show them you don't care, and they'll get the message. * Understand: * Your school years will pass, it will not matter 10 years after whether you were popular \- even the loners will move on and find friends and have a life. * School is simply there to provide an education, not to prove to perfect strangers that you're ""cool"". What matters to you is what counts, especially your education. * There are many millions of people in this world that have it a lot worse than you - if you don't like someone as a person, chances are you don't respect their negative opinions of you - think: it doesn't matter to you, they can keep their opinions to themselves. * There is a difference between maintaining your inner-self and making a ""reputation"" for yourself. Show people who you are, if they don't like it, then don't worry about it. Don't try to change yourself because a few people disapprove - there are over billions of us and you can't please everyone. * Willpower = Power of choice. If you lack patience, identify some of the big things where you feel you lack willpower, and go and take massive action in that area. Eg: If you fail to do your term paper on time, do it in the beginning of the term instead. An important part of this strategy is to take massive actions in as many areas as possible (with lots of decisions). The brain learns either through habituation or through massive action. * It is important to feel good while taking action or after taking action. The brain is hedonistic in nature. It likes to feel good."	Having fun while doing it, if possible. This is perhaps the best way to learn anything new. Do not be discouraged by initial failure - keep taking massive action even when you face failure.

Stop over-thinking. Most of the time, when you think you are being judged, you probably aren't. It's just too hard to judge every single person you meet, analyzing their flaws and imperfections like they're a test you're grading. * One way to test this is to push your limits a little and do something that is a bit out of the ordinary for you. See how people react. Chances are that only your “friends” will notice the change and make comments, but a random stranger really won’t care. * Learn to catch yourself when you start over-thinking. Recognize this pattern of abuse and do something to overcome it. For example, every time you over-think, force yourself to compliment an aspect of your personality. This should help to give you a better self-esteem: * ""Thinking is good. I pay attention to all the little details. I notice things that other people don't notice, but I should use this ability to be positive, not negative."" * ""I care about being good at something. No one can achieve perfection, but I try to put my best foot forward. If I fail or under perform, it's not like I didn't try. That's all I can do."" * ""I care about principles. I have values, and I try to live by them. The world doesn't always work the way I want it to, but that doesn't mean that I'll stop trying. I will accept it when it doesn't."" 2. Be pragmatic in your journey from seeking acceptance from others to truly accepting yourself. Most of us just crave to be accepted by others because of our past mental and collective conditioning, which governs our behavior to a large extent. For example, a person who didn't get much love and care from his/her parents may try extra hard to be accepted by others. * However, human mind is inherently needy, and even if one get's that acceptance they don't feel satisfied, except temporarily."	.

Get in shape! Being in shape is the most important aspect of Parkour. If you are not in shape, then you will get seriously injured. Do 25 pushups, 5 pull-ups, 50 squats, then stretch. These will all improve your endurance in a Parkour situation, and help you not to get injured, if you ever have to try something risky, like a fall. 2. Buy your clothes. However, know that there is no perfect pair of shoes or pants or shorts. It's simply what you can move in freely and won't hinder any movement. But some recommendations are: * Climbing pants, since they allow you to move freely, and are durable, fit well, and don't get in your way. Gramicci, Prana stretch Zion pants (very good), North Face, and Arborwear are recommended. Dickies are also durable and offer free range of motion. Jeans are not recommended, as they are too stiff and do not allow enough freedom of movement. * Buy shoes that are good for running (no skating shoes), that can grip various surfaces, have good shock absorption (forefoot absorption is great!), and you may want good toe bumpers, since it cushions those cat leaps. The shoes must be snug or else you're greatly increasing your risk of injury on landings. Nike Air Pegasus, Adidas Nova, K Swiss Ariake and Montrail Masai are good. * Shirts don't have to be anything fancy, but it's good to have a sweat wicking type. REI and running shoe stores have these. Long sleeves may be considered to prevent scrapes while first learning. 3. Start slowly, so that you will not get injured. Even if you think that you are not getting hurt, you may need to think of some of the long term effects of the things you are doing to your body. You need to condition and make your body used to doing certain things without over-stretching or bruising it. * Before trying actual parkour techniques, start exploring on what your body is comfortable with. By doing this, you'll find out which techniques to start with, and which ones will require more work. It will also help you gain awareness of your body and body control. 4. Landing: This is the basic landing that you will be incorporating into any basic drops. The principles of this basic landing will be used for the advanced landing (the Parkour roll) as well.	There are four main key points you always want to remember. 1- When you land your legs will be about shoulder width apart. 2- You will land on the balls of your feet. that way your body will act like a spring and distribute the landing. Land on the heels and your body will act like a stiff board and will injure your joints and body. 3-You will not allow your legs to bend below 90 degrees. Bend below 90 and you put too much strain on the knee joints. 4- When you have forward momentum, or are taking a higher drop. You will lean slightly forward and allow your hands to absorb some of the force. This will keep your legs from bending below 90 on the drop and enable you to continue your run. Only use this basic landing for small drops. Anything higher than 4 feet and you should go with the advanced landing below.

Dress to impress! Going to meet someone's parents in your vintage, hole-ridden, acid-washed jeans and Che Guevera shirt that you got from the thrift store the other day for three dollars probably won't get you their utmost respect. This doesn't mean wear a suit - just be presentable (e.g. a polo shirt or T-shirt that doesn't spread the communist agenda). 2. Park your car in front of their house, and lock both doors. This will be explained later. 3. When you meet them for the first time, give them a firm handshake. Nothing says ""I can't take care of your daughter"" more than a limp-noodle handshake. Not to mention, when it's firm, it shows you mean business. All men-who-mean-business use the firm shake. If you are feeling brave, throw in a pound and maybe even a low-five. 4. Make good conversation. One of the most pivotal parts of meeting anyone - parents, girls, the president - is the conversation. If you have mastered the art of conversation, you are a deadly force just waiting to disarm parents at every turn. Use anecdotes and, most importantly, well-timed jokes. This does, however, have a pre-requisite - knowing when to throw in a comment. Only after practice will one truly master this art. Learn from experience, I.E., look at your conversations with your ex-girlfriend's parents - that's probably why she's your ex-girlfriend. 5. Be prepared for the Q & A session. There comes a time in every first meeting where you will be blindsided with the question and answer session - a feared part of the conversation where you are assaulted with questions that end only upon the submission of your manhood. It is very important to answer most of these questions in the affirmative, unless they begin with, ""Have you ever...,"" ""When is the last time you...,"" ""Have you ever committed a felony..."" - in which case it is best to use your discretion. By the end of this session, you will most likely feel out of breath, beaten, and less of a man - however, if done correctly, you will soon be on to step five. If not, a 'family emergency' might suddenly come up that somehow doesn't allow you to go out with your date tonight. You didn't even know she had a Uncle Pedro in Tapai, or that myxomatosis affected humans - but you hope he gets better soon. 6. Say farewell. This is the most relieving part of the entire parental-unit-meeting-situation, but only for the champions who have made it past the first four steps. Usually characterized by a dark, evil stare by the father as he opens the door to let you out, and sided with a ""Have her home by ____,"" - in which case you respond you will have her home within plenty of time to make that deadline - this is the green-mile. Once you exit the door, it is imperative not to look back - because you know damn well that her parents are watching until you are out of sight. 7."	Turn around and flash her parents a smile while you close the door if you are feeling dangerous. Once you get in, make sure she is buckled-up and do the same, otherwise you will notice her father's face twist and distort behind the screen door. Finally, give a single-hand acknowledgment of her parent's presence behind their door, and drive away at no faster than fifteen miles-an-hour until you are out of their sight.

Stay out of the heat. Maintaining a normal body temperature will also help a great deal in feeling less thirsty. The first step is staying out of the heat so you don’t become too hot. Overheating starts a chain reaction in which your internal AC unit kicks in to cool you, creating sweat. This then causes you to lose body fluids and become thirsty. Because the sun is at its strongest between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., try to rearrange your schedule so that you're not outside during these times, particularly during hot periods of the year. * Run your errands in the early morning, for example. Have lunch delivered to your office rather than getting into your sweltering car twice – once on the way to lunch and again on your return. * If staying out of the heat isn’t possible, try to limit the length of each outing as much as you can. * Use buildings and trees to provide shade from the sun. * And don’t forget that air conditioning was created for a purpose – to keep you cool. 2. Wear appropriate clothing. Sometimes we simply can’t avoid being in the heat. Another way to make adjustments, however, is to choose clothes that will reduce the likelihood of becoming overheated. When it’s very hot out and you cannot avoid it, or when you know you’ll be in an environment that will make you sweat if not properly attired, pick your clothes wisely. * If outside, wear lightweight, light-colored cotton or linen clothes. Light-colored clothes will reflect, rather than absorb, the sun’s rays. Cotton and linen are both fabrics that breathe, so they won’t trap heat like polyester, acrylic, nylon and rayon fabrics will. * If you can avoid layers, definitely do so. They will only trap in heat to a greater extent, creating more sweat and less room for its escape. * Stay away from tight-fitting clothes, too, unless they are specifically designed for breathability and to wick sweat. 3. Avoid too much exercise. Working out raises the risk of dehydration – if not adequately replenished – because your core body temperature rises, causing you to sweat and to lose body fluid. Controlling your body temperature, then, is critical, particularly if you do not or cannot adequately replenish the fluids lost. *	.

Gather the ingredients. Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, gather the following ingredients: * 1 1/4 cup flour * 1 1/4 cup salt * 1 tablespoon cream of tartar * 3/4 cup warm water * 1 tablespoon cooking oil 2. Mix the ingredients. Pour the flour, salt, and cream of tartar in a mixing bowl. Use a spoon to mix the ingredients well. * In a variation of this recipe, you can cook the dough in a saucepan. To do this, instead of pouring the the ingredients into a mixing bowl, put them in a saucepan. 3. Add a little warm water. Pour a small amount of the warm water into the bowl and start mixing the mixture with a spoon. It should start clumping together as you mix. * For the cooked variation, add the water and the oil into the saucepan. Turn the stove eye on low, and continue cooking on low and stirring until the dough has thickened. This may take a few minutes. 4. Continue pouring a small stream of water. Keep pouring the water in as you mix the batter. Soon the ingredients will form a sticky dough. * Many factors affect the consistency of the clay, like humidity in the air and the type and brand of flour being used. If your clay is too watery, add a little more flour. If the clay is too sticky, add a little more flour. If the clay is dry and flaky, add a little water. Add it in very small measures and knead the dough a little. Repeat the process until you think your clay has the right consistency. 5. Add the oil.	Don't add too much, or it will affect the consistency of the dough and make it harder to mold.

Be honest about your struggles. Don’t hide your struggles with mental illness in your marriage. You might fear feeling stigmatized by your spouse or ashamed to express your struggles. Be truthful about your challenges and don’t feel the need to hide yourself. * Speak truthfully about what’s difficult for you and how it affects your life. For example, you can say, “There are times I feel stressed and overwhelmed and begin to experience OCD. It starts to take over my life in big ways, and I struggle to feel in control.” 2. Attend regular therapy. Therapy is an important part of treating mental illness. While medications can be helpful, they do not treat the main cause of mental illness and often have side-effects. Engage in regular therapy with a therapist you trust and feel comfortable talking to. Talk to your therapist about how your mental illness affects your marriage and what you can do to improve it. * Even if you’re coping well with your mental illness, have a therapist you know you can reach out to in times of trouble. For more information, check out How to Find a Good Psychologist. 3. Say what you need. Honest communication is important to any marriage, and especially important if you have certain needs related to your well-being. If you have a need related to your mental illness, share it with your spouse. For example, if you experience mood swings, tell your partner that you need space during that time and it’s nothing personal.	.

Measure the distance from one thread to the next in millimeters. Hold a ruler up against the threads, lengthwise. Measure from one high point (one mountain) to the next, looking at millimeters. You need a very detailed ruler for this, as it could be 0.4 millimeters. * This can be difficult for very fine screws, so you may want to use a pitch gauge for those if possible. 2. Figure out the diameter and the length of the threaded area. Measure from the bottom of the head to the end of the threaded area in millimeters. For instance, it might be 8 millimeters. Then, measure the diameter (width) of the threaded area in millimeters, such as 4 millimeters. * Always measure the major diameter, which is the distance across the threaded area with the high points of the threads, not the low points. 3. Put the measurements in the proper order. Start out with the diameter with an M in front of it. Then, add the pitch next. Follow that with the length of the threaded area in millimeters with an M behind it. *	.

Swallow your pride. Most people find it difficult to quietly beg for money from friends or relatives; it’s even harder to beg from complete strangers where everybody can see you. Still, you’re going to have to suck it up and be humble. It may help to keep in mind that in many countries, begging does not hold the stigma it does in most of the Western World, and in some places asking for alms is considered an honorable profession, such as with Hindu sadhus who pursue begging for spiritual reasons. 2. Remember what you're offering. People who give you money do so because it makes them feel good. A person is more likely to help you if they can identify with you, and if they feel their contribution will make a significant difference in your situation. Sometimes, people give alms for religious reasons, and other times because they feel guilty for having been born with so much more than others without having necessarily earned it. The more you learn about why people give, the better you'll be at receiving. 3. Clean up. Before you begin, make an effort to look presentable. You certainly don’t want to be stinking of alcohol, for example, but you also should comb your hair, practice overall good hygiene, and dress in clean, but cheap clothes. Wear comfortable shoes and dress in layers so you don’t get too warm or cold. You want to present an image of a hard-working, normal person who is just like the people from whom you are asking for money, except that you’re a little down on your luck. 4. Make a sign. A simple sign on a piece of cardboard makes you more noticeable and tells your story—it’s advertising, plain and simple. Remember, you want to make people feel good for giving you money, so give them a reason: you just got laid off, you’ve got a family to feed, etc., and you need help. Tell your story concisely, and make your sign in neat, large letters. 5. Find a suitable location. Location is all-important to a successful begging endeavor, and the most important facet of location is traffic. The more traffic you can get, the better. There are two general approaches to location: you can target foot traffic or automobile traffic, but usually not both. * Foot traffic: Find a busy sidewalk and “set up shop” so as to be noticeable and unavoidable, but unobtrusive. Street corners and public squares (places where a lot of people tend to slow down or stop) are usually good locations. Stores where people make small purchases, such as grocery, liquor, and convenience stores, are often good because people will come out with change. Experiment a bit with different locations to find the best spots. * Auto traffic: Find a median or curb at a busy intersection with a long stoplight. The median should be right next to stopped cars’ windows, preferably on the driver’s side (every car has a driver). You can stand in place or, better yet, slowly walk up and down the median when cars are stopped at the light. 6. Smile and / or greet people courteously. You'd be surprised how far a simple, unassuming smile will go. Smiles are welcoming, and put people at ease. Especially in the U.S., people generally appreciate a positive attitude. Then again, remember that you’re down on your luck, and you may want to play it a bit differently. Regardless of your approach, say “hello” or “good morning” to people and make an effort to notice them politely—they’ll be more likely to do the same to you. 7. Ask for money directly and softly. You may assume that people know you want money, and most people do, but you’ve still got to work for it. Ask passersby nicely and in a quiet voice—they’ll have to listen more carefully and may slow down, and you’ll also appear less aggressive. Have something to put money in: a cup, a cap, a guitar case, a pan, etc. This makes it easier for people to quickly drop some change in. Empty it regularly so people—both customers and potential crooks—can't see how much you’re bringing in. 8. Thank everybody. If someone gives you money, show your appreciation.	Doing so will make them think twice about refusing your request next time they pass you. It’s like giving them a free sample of your product.

Pack_and_Move_Your_Cat.txt	Begin_Revision	0.961	## Steps	81	So you do n't make a mess while driving , give your cat a few ice cubes instead of a messy water bowl that could spill .	### Travel by Car:	122	If you do n't make a mess while driving , give your cat a few ice cubes instead of a messy water bowl that could spill .	<replace><So><1><If><1>	True	Steps  1. 1.) Moving Prep: Keep your cat’s blankets, toys, beds, food, and water out until moving day to keep them in their natural state for as long as possible. Pack the cats belongings, extra food, and water in a set aside empty box the day of the move. This helps to put their nerves at ease for as long as possible. But before the move make sure to take your cat to the veterinarian and make sure that your vet issues any vaccinations or procedures needed, so that you have a fresh start for your move and updated records. Get copies of the updated records and keep them accessible while in transit. When you begin to pack your belongings, the best non-threatening way, is to pack and empty one room at a time. After one is completed place your cat inside the room along with it’s travel crate, bedding, toys, food, and water. This process allows your cat to feel accustomed to its crate and its new room/home throughout the packing process. 2. 2.) Moving Day: Though out the moving process it is vet recommended that verbal assurance can prevent stress your cat may encounter from moving. Another calming proactive step can be to let your cats sleep with you to offer the comfort they will be searching for in this stressful process. On moving day, make sure your cat is safe and placed in an empty room that won’t be disturbed. If you didn’t take this precaution the cat would be in harms way by getting into open boxes or in the way of mover’s. It also prevents them from hiding and not being located when its time to move. Also, place their toys, food, water, and bedding in their temporary room for comfort. Stick to normalcy by following normal feeding schedules, amount of play time, and normal location of litter box. And last but not least, have a box of fresh food and water present for the travel time and the arrival, so the cat can eat at normal times and avoid dehydration. 3. 3.) Travel by Car: If choosing to travel by car, remember that cats are not the best passengers and are often skittish in moving cars. A helpful tip is to get your cat ready for the journey by driving around the block as a test run. If the test run goes poorly or it is too much to handle veterinarians provide the option of sedatives that you may want to consider. With cats, it’s important to remember a litter box for the drive, so they can use the same restroom as they usually do. Keep the cat from sliding around in the carrier by placing towels on the bottom of the carrier. It’s also advised to put a towel over the crate or carrier to make the cat feel more hidden and safe. Make sure to have the box of supplies, food, and any special medications you might need accessible in the car. If you stop at a rest area, make sure your cat gets a stretch break on a leash. Make sure the leash is properly fitted to prevent any skittish behavior. Also, while driving, it’s imperative to keep your cat hydrated.	.

Observe locations of those already situated on the beach. Place your beach paraphernalia a minimum of 15 ft. from anyone already in an established spot. 2. The tide will come up at some point, remember that when deciding on a location. If you are too close to the water, you will eventually have to move. By that time someone will most likely be behind you, and it's rude to expect them to move back for you. It's even more rude to get closer to them. 3. Remember that your voice carries in the wind, so there is no need to yell at your children at a higher octave than you usually do when attempting to lather them with sunscreen. 4. Umbrellas fly. When inserting yours into the sand, pay attention to the direction that the wind is blowing. Umbrellas are best secured when inserted at an angle, so the wind blows against the umbrella, not underneath it. 5. Keep radio volume to a minimum. Again, noise travels on the beach. 6. Do not smoke. 7. Feeding seagulls may be exciting for your children, but seagulls are vulture-like at the beach. Feeding them will only keep them hovering. It is very important to keep your food covered and do not feed the seagulls. 8. Do not walk close to other people's towels while wearing flip flops. It will flip the sand right onto their towel and that is incredibly rude. Remind your children not to run on their way to the water. Sand flies when children run. 9. Game playing should take place near the dunes, away from the crowds. Only obnoxious people play ball over others heads while they are trying to relax.	Incredibly annoying.

Grab a kitchen chair and turn it so that the back of the chair is facing towards you. 2. Weigh the seat of the chair down with books and other semi heavy items to ensure that it will not tip backwards nearly as easily. 3. Position yourself behind the chair. 4. Use the top of the back of the chair to act as your ballet barre. Or, if your chair has horizontal rungs spaced several inches apart, you can rest your leg in between one of the rungs. This is useful if you don't have enough leg strength or flexibility to reach the top of the chair. * A great alternative to a kitchen chair is to use a kitchen counter top- you don't have to weigh it down because it won't tip over, plus, it's a lot larger- giving you more space to position your leg. 5. Use a table, either a kitchen table or a card table. You can adjust the table to be the height you need it to be. 6. As a last resort use the back of a sofa- this isn't quite as nice as the other options above, however, as it can be a bit too soft and squish under your leg.	.

Even though it might still take forever and you think you might be wasting your time, you will know (and remember) a lot more for your final. 2. Go to class and take notes. Having clear and detailed notes will help you tremendously while studying. 3. Actually read through your notes once in a while. Unless of course you have a photographic memory and remember everything right when you write it down. But I doubt it... 4. Participate and ask questions. The only way you will remember all the information is when you make the appropriate connections in your brain. That can only happen if you are absolutely clear about the material your professor is covering. (Or at least the material that will be on the exam.) So don't hesitate just ask. Others will learn from your questions as well. 5. Go to your professors' Office Hours. Just because you are a friendly person doesn't mean you will get an A but knowing your professor helps. As much as some of them don't show it...they care! Get to know the way your professor thinks and show them that you care about the class as well. If you have questions or want to review your professor's office is the best place to go. 6. Study hard.	Find your learning style and use appliances such as flash cards, study guides, review sessions and intelligent friends.

That way, if you're nervous, then you can join a group. (It'll also be good to meet the other cosplayers anyway for advice and counsel.) 3. Once you've got some ideas, discuss them with friends or fellow cosplayers--they will always be willing to lend you a hand! Choosing a character with a costume and look that would be flattering to you is a good idea, since we don't all have stick thin waists and busts like anime characters! Think about how you would feel wearing the costumes and narrow your list. If any of the costumes might make you feel uncomfortable then it's pointless to go through the hassle of making it. You want to be comfortable come convention time! 4. Assuming you have maybe three ideas left, look at the realistic possibilities of you making the costume. Things to consider are your skill level (everyone has to start somewhere, so if you've only just learnt how to use a sewing machine then choose something you will be able to get a pattern for. But if you're a seasoned pro you can probably make your own patterns from scratch.), and budget. If you're on a tight budget you can source cheap fabrics on the internet or at local fabric stores but beware that thin or cheap looking fabrics will show up on cameras and to other more experienced cosplayers. If you don't mind saying happily ""Oh no, I just did this cheaply"" then that's fine! If you don't want to enter competitions and you have the money then you can also get your chosen costume custom made for you. Price up how much your costume will cost to buy or make and pick the one that fits your budget and skills best. 5. When budgeting, make sure you take into account all the bits and pieces including fabrics, wastes and mishaps, accessories, hard materials like polymer clay and board for props, makeup, wigs and hair products, and shoes. If you think you can handle it all with both timescale and budget then I'd say you've got your costume choice. 6. Now you're ready to actually make your costume (hopefully a month or two in advance of the event!), take some time to make sure you nail every detail. Other cosplayers will definitely appreciate your fine eye! If you can't manage all the details or can't manage to buy clothing store-bought and alter it, you can always take your own design choices. Ask other cosplaying communities for their support and advice. 7."	If your character is serious and pensive then a big daft grin won't display your character very well! Also take in mind the props and limitations of the costume so you don't come up with grand poses which you can't actually do. If you intend on taking part in a masquerade, take steps to ensure you can walk in your costume! (Some characters have costumes that like to defy gravity and would fall off any normal person and we can't have your costume falling apart around you!)

Organize yourself. Before you start this epic journey of Red Bull, jumping jacks, and avoiding Facebook, you'll be a lot more productive (and a lot less distracted) if you get organized. Before you sink into the couch and are past the point of no return, think about the following: * Make a schedule. Your life is probably jam packed with hobbies, social obligations, and a whole bunch of stuff you'd rather be doing. So make a schedule and, dang it, stick to it. * Get all your papers. Even those assignments you completed what feels like years ago. And most important of all? Your syllabus. * Get everything you could possible need. From paper clips to highlighters to extra pillows, get it now. * Have water, something healthy, and something not so healthy (recent studies say dark chocolate increases cognitive function!). And if you're feeling sluggish, some caffeine. And don't feel bad about the extra large latte -- caffeine (at least in moderate amounts) can totally up your game. 2. Specify your study schedule. So you manned up and blocked off a 2 hour chunk this Thursday for studying history. Awesome -- that's step 1. Now actually make it useful! Devote this Thursday to the Seven Years' War. Monday you can do the French Revolution and next Wednesday you'll make it all the way to Napoleon and his delusions of grandeur. Have specific goals in mind -- whether it be by concepts, time, or number of pages or chapters. It'll seem infinitely more doable. * And if you have more than one exam to take, be sure to balance them out as need be. You don't need to study the same amount -- concentrate on the harder one. You can use the other subject for a break from the other if you're really strapped for time. 3. Make your notes less drab and dull. The great thing about studying (turns out there actually is one, yes) is that you can do it however the heck you want. So take that snoozefest of a lecture you were victim of and turn it into something enjoyable. Something that you'll remember. * Bust out those highlighters. Use one color for main concepts, one color for vocab, and another color for dates, etc. When you go over your notes, they'll be that much easier to skim. * Make your own charts, graphs, and diagrams from the information. Pictures are so much easier to look at and to recall when you're sitting at that desk at test time. 40% of all carbon emissions come from the agricultural industry? Sounds like time for a pie chart. * It may actually benefit you to rewrite your notes. Studies show that exposing yourself to the information in different ways (that is, instead of just reading it, you're writing it, too) makes it stick in your noggin longer. But don't rewrite them all -- stick to a loose outline. 4. Mix it up. In one study session, all the science is pointing to studying different concepts in different places. Turns out that when your brain is so totally done sitting on the toilet reading about photosynthesis that it'll actually do you good to go to the cafe and start reading up on Punnett squares. Here's the gist: * Study in different places. Turns out our brains make associations between our surroundings and what's going on. The more associations you have, the stronger the connection. * Study different concepts. You wouldn't expect a basketball player to work on his lay-ups for three hours straight, right? Same goes for students. If you do division problem after division problem, your brain is going to go on autopilot. Work on different concepts to keep your brain from turning to mush. 5. Take breaks. It's not slacking -- it's you supercharging. It's science you can blame -- it says that breaks help your brain get back into the game and replenish your attentional defecits. So take a 5 or 10 minute break every hour. It'll help -- not hinder -- your memory and focus. * If you really wanna get serious, take that break to do some jumping jacks or jog around the block. Getting your blood pumping gets your brain pumping.	Exercise, turns out, can increase work stamina.

Ditch the porn stereotypes. Porn is like all other movies: they do not reflect reality. Porn is shot and set up to look good on camera, but it usually doesn't reflect what actually feels good or what a real sexual encounter looks like. * Try to go in with no expectations. Just let things go naturally. 2. Take your time to enjoy it. You want to enjoy every minute of the entire experience. It shouldn't be a ""get-in-get-out"" operation. Enjoy the whole sexual experience. Slow down, explore your partner's whole body. Don't just go for the cliché parts. * Make a point to keep kissing. Returning for a sexy make out every now and again can be a great way to draw out the experience. 3. Focus on foreplay. Before jumping right to the main event, spend some time kissing, caressing, and pleasing one another. Foreplay can make sex last longer and feel more sensual and romantic. Women especially find that foreplay is helpful in getting them in the right mood, whereas men are usually ready to go at any moment. * Men, it's in your best interest to have your lady in the mood. It will increase her natural lubrication and make her enjoy it more. 4. Keep the compliments flowing. You should make sure that your partner never doubts for a moment that you think he or she is pretty much the hottest thing on the planet, maybe even the hottest thing for the next couple planets. When you see something you like, let them know. * You don't always have to say it, but take time to enjoy it. Let them see you enjoying it too. 5. Lube up. Personal lubrication products can significantly improve sexual satisfaction. Lubricant is very important to good sex, it cannot be emphasized enough, especially if your partner is a woman. Sexual interactions involve a lot of friction, and friction is a good."	You can get lubricants through your doctor, a sexual health clinic, stores and pharmacies, and online.
Play_the_Trumpet.txt	Inside_Revision	0.762	## Steps	21772	Because buzzing can be a very hard step to master for some people , carry around a mouthpiece with you .	### Part 3: Learning with the trumpet	32990	Since buzzing can be a very hard step to master for some people , carry around a mouthpiece with you .	<replace><Because><1><Since><1>	True	"Steps  1. Get a trumpet. Go to your local music shop and ask the clerk for a student trumpet to rent or buy. Ask to make sure the trumpet is in the key of B flat (B flat only). It may be an unlabeled brand. Don't worry; many student instruments come from an unmarked brand. It is fine to start off with. Make sure you check the following before you start to rent your new trumpet. Remember buying a Trumpet can be expensive. * That the valve casing has no dents in it. * That the valves move up and down smoothly and not too noisily. * And that all the slides move freely back and forth. 2. Keep your trumpet in its case to start. Say the letter ""M"", but stop at the ""mmm"" part. Keep your lips in that position. Now, blow through this position in a buzzing sound. It may sound odd at first, but that is the basic lip position to use while playing. 3. To get 'buzzing' down, here are a few tips: Pretend there is a small piece of paper on the tip of your tongue. Stick your tongue out slightly, just the tip, and scrape the paper off of your tongue quickly and spit it away from your mouth. Your lips should catch each other, creating a sound similar to a 'raspberry'. 4. Get out your trumpet. After assembling it fully, inhale through your mouth, assume the proper lip position, put the instrument up to your lips, and blow. Don't push any buttons yet. You should feel your lips change tightness as they lock into a note. Don't push the buttons yet! 5. After playing your first note, try tightening your lips slightly and pushing down valves one and two (Valves are numbered one through three. Valve number one is closest to you, and valve number three is toward the bell of the horn). The note should be higher. 6. Congratulations! You've now played your first two notes on a trumpet! 7. Learn your first scale. A scale is an ascending or descending collection of pitches proceeding by a specified scheme of intervals. * Go to this web site and play this note on your trumpet while pushing no valves down.(http://www.musikit.com/Merchant2/SOUND/Midi/Bb3.mid). That note is C. * Push down valves one and three, and play this note. This is D. (If you can't play D, try barely tightening your lips). * Push down valves one and two, tighten your lips a little more, and play this note, E: (http://www.musikit.com/Merchant2/SOUND/Midi/D4.mid). * Next, push down valve one, tighten your lips a little more, and blow this note, F: (http://www.musikit.com/Merchant2/SOUND/Midi/Eb4.mid). * Now, don't push down any valves, tighten your lips some more, and play this note, G: (http://www.musikit.com/Merchant2/SOUND/Midi/F4.mid). * Push down valves one and two, tighten your lips some more, and play this note, A: (http://www.musikit.com/Merchant2/SOUND/Midi/G4.mid). * Push down only valve two, tighten you lips a little more, and play this note, B: (http://www.musikit.com/Merchant2/SOUND/Midi/A4.mid). * Finally, let go of all the valves and play this note, high C: (http://www.musikit.com/Merchant2/SOUND/Midi/Bb4.mid). * Congratulations! You just played your first C scale on a trumpet. This is also called the ""Concert B flat"" scale, but you will learn more about that when you get a music book. 8. Practice the scale as much as possible. Try to practice every day for at least 15 minutes. It's recommended that you practice about an hour a day, once you have the stamina for it, but when you start off, and especially when you only have one scale to play, fifteen minutes should be plenty. 9. Buy a beginner trumpet music book, and follow those instructions from here. What you've learned here is only one of twelve scales; the book should teach you at least one or two, and many songs, before you move on to another, or sheet music. Good luck! The trumpet is a great instrument that takes a whole lot of practice to play it well. 10."	If you buzz into your mouthpiece correctly, you should be able to make a coherent sound. It may sound a lot like Donald Duck, but that is a good thing. If you sound like Donald, you're doing something right.

If you want you can move it 2 times / 1 time. * The pawns or soldiers are the most lowest piece, i.e they are not so valuable. But don't be careless about them because they are the major defenders. * Keep in mind that the pawns can only move forward and not in any other directions but they can attack the enemy only diagonally and with one step. * Queen is the important attacker because it has both the powers of the bishop and rook. It can move horizontally, vertically and diagonally. So watch your queen importantly.

Consider how you gained a bias and how it can be so powerful. Biases affect us all in ways we seldom fully realize, even when we have one we are aware of and would like to deal with. We may see ordinary happy peopling their day to day live in all kinds on environments, but they all have a bias of some kind and this is directing their intentions. Biases can be positive or negative aspects of human nature and how we act and interact with other people and events. Its important to compare them, because the way we create biases in our minds is the same for mild ones and severe ones. Some aspects to consider are: * People form their personal identity based on a wide scope of aspects, but one of the most pervasive is bias. We often hold onto our bias because we feel they make us what we are. This however is ultimately deceptive as a bias is not what or who we are as our biases change often. It is equally proportionate to the difficulty it is to let go of a bias in relation to how precious it is to us. * People of similar thinking often pool together like raindrops that form a lake. There is nothing wrong with this, but it can influence you quite strongly as a form of peer pressure. People select their partners, friends and associates according to personal biases and actually often train them to adopt personal biases without realizing. This is largely because we want our friends to be like us. It can also happen exactly in the reverse that we want to be like our friends and so adopt the same biases. We are highly susceptible to influence from others (current and historical life has shown we also do commit suicide, murder and even war from the power of influence.) Many employers look for employees with similar thoughts and feelings. * People seldom like others who ""sit on the fence"", are secretive about their feelings or are neutral as they cannot easily categorize, predict or rely on them to be able to suit their own agenda. Being able to rely on another person is an important aspect, but while a person may be reliable, without trust people would still be hesitant to rely on that person. Trust is often built on finding common biases and prejudice as a way to identify with a person and for probability calculating. * The flipside is the case when a person sees someone with skillful, beneficial or admirable qualities may start to be influenced to adopt and practice these same positive qualities. This is usually called positive influence but it works in the same way as its opposite case when someone adopts harmful or unskillful biases from negative influences. We model our good behavior from qualities we all have, but only from seeing others do them in a normal environment. Adopting biases are a way to be accepted by others be it for better or worse, but can also a way to improve oneself if they are the positive kind. * Bias and prejudice may often have been something someone has told you, or that you heard as a third party so are not always your own original opinion but one you have adopted. It may have been recently or a long time ago and the older it is the more tricky it can be to overcome. * Sometimes the bias reappears into the mind on impulse, such as seeing or hearing of something related to the object of your bias. It can also expand by being aware of something that is similar to your original bias. Very often there is an emotion behind your prejudice, is it greed (wanting something to be, something to happen), hatred (rejecting or wanting something to go away etc), or just ignorance of the object itself? 2. Consider various ways you can gain some insight into your bias. Meditation is a good way to investigate your bias as well as how your mind acts. Another good method is to discuss it with a friend, counselor, or a psychologist. 3. Recognize that the specific bias exists as the beginning to overcome them. If you can, this means admitting there is a bias there, as in really admit it - not just think there is a bias. Often this is very difficult for most people to do honestly as it is something of a humble act."	By recognizing it and what it relies on to stay in the mind, then you are one step closer to getting rid of it.

(duh) 5. then you have to give your character HP. most heroes HP will be like between 4000 and 6000. a boss will have like 100000 HP. yes it does seem impossible but I've seen it done. you can give it levels to decide its HP or just throw some numbers above the characters name. and also give it MP (magic points) the MP should be the same as the HP. remember no MP means no magic. and you also need attack points. a normal attack will be 380 or so and magic will do about 600. but for a boss a normal attack will do 1000 and a magic attack will almost kill you. 6. now to draw all of this on paper. draw the characters you made up and the monster(s). think of a job to give your characters. then give them some HP and MP. then for magic attacks i would draw sparkles around there hand and then make the magic happen.	.

Consider moving to a nation or state which provides extensive programs for those who may not be working, or less successfully, or not earning enough. You can find good options for welfare. Choose your state and city carefully, as many cities have a nice array of housing, food, medical programs, etc. The more a city is offering, the more you might get, as long as you have chosen to live in the right one! 2. Work as you may, if you are to be a ""welfare"" or ""unearned assistance"" recipient. If you work, and make more than the arbitrary amount deemed as a minimum by the welfare entity, you could lose some or all your benefits for a certain period of time, for months, each year. Know the annual amount allowed. Check with agencies in your nation, state or local area. They are full of people who know the rules, and they will help guide you so that you don't accidentally make enough money that you will be required to pay tax. Paying much tax is a good way to lose money, so you probably would not want to do that. 3. Work and earn some money, being sure to stay within the government limits, if you wish. You may want to get back or keep more of what you make, if so then you may be careful not to earn too much. 4. Don't get too excited about working harder or being more motivated if you are a recipient. It may not pay if you want to receive entitlements (unearned assistance). The harder or smarter you work, or the more time you spend working, the more money you can get in the long-run. This sounds good, until you realize the facts. ""Accumulating"" a certain amount of money/savings/property, can knock you out of eligibility for several kinds of programs similar to:Medicaid, (do not confuse this with earned insurance like Medicare),Rent support, Free preschool, etc. 5. Volunteer, if you are a workaholic and just can't seem to stop being productive. There is no reason that working hard has to get in the way of collecting state benefits, or being a professional student, as long as you don't get paid much for what you do. So, work some to try to stay productive and on top of your normal life. 6. Work in the government field. Here, you can ""earn"" national, state, or city benefits, and you (often times) can't be fired for many reasons. Government workers are not always expected to be particularly hard-working or motivated. Government structures government jobs with some protections for the worker. They don't want you to lose the job because of lacklustre performance, and they don't usually have any pesky sales goals or anything else to measure you by. So you can sometimes mark time, do the minimum, and still collect a nice paycheck with a virtually guaranteed future. 7. Retire early in your life."	This can lead to more time with your family, etc., so don't knock it. But again, you may have to limit the assets you hold. Be sure to work with an attorney to gift your assets to your children. Once you have given everything away, you get closer to becoming eligible for all kinds of government programs. Many middle class Americans help their elderly parents to get on to Medicaid programs in this manner. It is legal, if you follow strict rules, and will allow the parent to go into a state-funded nursing home. Nursing homes cost money, so they are a drain on the resources you may have built up over your life. Some people will move assets from the parent to the child about three to five years before the parent is expected to need nursing home care.

Watch a movie. There's nothing like curling up to watch a movie at the end of an overly long day. Unless a movie is dreadfully boring or their bladders are tempting them elsewhere, people aren't usually thinking of the time while they're watching a movie. Instead, they're immersed in what's on the screen. Watching one of your favourite movies during or after dinner can be an incredibly rewarding experience. * Curling up somewhere comfortable like a bed or sofa is a must in this case. If your body's relaxed, you'll have an easier time letting the time slip you by. 2. Make a new recipe for dinner. When you're learning something new, time seems to speed up. This is because the mind is too occupied with the fresh tasks to be as concerned with the passage of time. Your stomach will thank you for the new experience, and if you like the recipe enough, you can use it again on future occasions. *	This would include recipes. The bottom line is that you want to be engaging with something.

Play_Cribbage.txt	Begin_Revision	0.76	## Steps	1500	And 5 points are pegged .	## Steps	1552	Then 5 points are pegged .	<replace><And><1><Then><1>	True	"Steps  1. Get a cribbage board (including pegs) and a standard deck of 52 cards. The jokers will not be used. Cribbage pegs are often stored underneath the board. Each player will need two pegs for scoring. The set may include additional pegs for keeping track of match scores. If a proper board is unavailable, the players can keep score with pencil and paper. The first to accumulate 121 points wins. (This often occurs in the middle of a deal; the game ends immediately.) 2. Remove the pegs from the underside of the crib board. During play, these pegs will ""leapfrog"" over each other to help you keep accurate score. 3. THE DEALING ROUND: To determine who deals first, any player picks up the deck and shuffles it 2 or 3 times. The deck is placed face down on the table; each player pulls out one card. The person with the lowest card is the dealer. For a 2-player game, the dealer deals 6 cards each, alternating back and forth, starting with his opponent. Cribbage is considered ""a gentleman's game,"" so the cards are not ""cut"" between shuffling and dealing. Among skilled players, it is estimated that the person who deals first wins 57% of the time. 4. Each deal consists of several phases described in more detail later. In order the following events occur: The discard, Pegging, count Pone's hand, count Dealer's hand, cound Dealer's crib. If after scoring these, neither player has reached 121 points, play continues with Pone dealing the next hand. A typical game involves about 9 deals. 5. Each player looks at their 6 cards and decides which 4 to keep in his hand and which 2 to discard into a pile near the dealer called ""the crib."" 6. After the crib cards are put into the crib (4 cards all together), the player who did not deal cuts the remaining deck to determine the top card: The remaining deck is placed on the table; the non-dealer places his hand over the deck and lifts up as many cards from the pile as he wishes - 5 cards, half the deck, 2/3 of the deck - whatever he desires. The dealer then picks up the card on the top of the remaining pile; the nondealer returns the stack he is holding back onto the rest of the deck and the card that the non-dealer is holding is flipped over and placed on the pile. Both players will use this card , called the ""cut"", as a sort of wild fifth card to count points at the end of the round. 7. If the ""up-card"" is a Jack, the dealer gets to peg 2 points. This score is called ""his heels."" 8. THE PEGGING ROUND: During this round, players alternate laying cards down, starting with the non-dealer (or the one without the crib in front of him). As they play each card, they call out the value of the total. Face cards are worth 10 points, all others are worth their numeric value. Aces are always only worth 1 point (but this does not mean that they have little value as you will find out during the Pegging part of the game). Suits do not matter in this round, only numeric values. 9. For example, Player 1 lays down a 4 and calls out ""four."" Player 2 then plays a King and calls out ""fourteen."" Player 1 then lays down a 6 and calls out ""twenty."" Player 2 lays down a 5 and says ""twenty-five."" And so on, until a player cannot lay down another card without exceeding 31. At this point, he says ""go."" If the other player can still lay down another card without exceeding 31, he must do so ... as many times as he can. For example, he lays down a 2 and says ""twenty-seven"" and then he lays down a 3 and says ""thirty."" Once he lays down as many cards as he can without going over 31, he says ""go"" and earns 1 point. However, if the total he ends up with is exactly 31, he smiles (nicely), says ""go"" and pegs 2 points. (You can see here how an Ace or two could come in handy. And remember, if he lays down two Aces in a row, he also gets to count 2 points for the pair.) 10. During this process of trying to reach ""31,"" other points may be pegged if earned. If either player reaches 15 points exactly, this earns him 2 points - he says ""fifteen for two"" and pegs 2 points - and they continue on to 31. Points are also earned and pegged if a pair is played; that is if Player 1 lays down a 6 and Player 2 immediately follows with another 6, he pegs 2 points, saying ""twelve for two."" (Note: If Player 1 lays down a third 6, he earns 6 points (for 3 pairs), saying ""eighteen for six."" Of course, if Player 2 immediately lays down the fourth 6, he would earn 12 points (for 6 pairs). (And remember, if Player 2 is not able to lay down any other card without exceeding 31, and Player 1 has the fourth 6, he can lay it down and earn the 12 points. 11. After ""31"" (or as close as you'll get) is reached, the person laying down the last card takes his point for ""final card,"" and you start all over, even if there is only one card between the two of you. The person who did not lay down the last card starts (unless he has no cards left). 12. THE COUNTING ROUND: Now, all cards have been played out and it is time to count up your cards. The person to count first is the person who does not have the crib (or the non-dealer as it were.) This is very important to remember because the person who ultimately wins is not the person who has the most pegs (points) at the end of the last hand, but rather the person who pegs out first, whether pegging out happens during the Pegging section or the Counting section of the game! You may think this is loopy at first (and perhaps not fair); however, strategies are built around it, and you will soon be used to it and learn how to work it to your advantage. (And, of course, so will your opponent!) 13. Counting up your cards. Hour hand consists of the four cards you used in the pegging phase, plus the cut card. You must then score these five cards. (For almost all scoring it doesn't matter which is the cut card. There are two exceptions. You score one point if you hold the Jack of the suit that was cut. Also, the cut cannot give you a flush. It gives a fifth point if it extends a 4 card flush to a 5 card flush, but 3 spades and a heart don't score flush points if you cut a spade. When counting the crib, only 5 card flushes score.) Pairs, triples and quadruples (very rare) count, 2, 6 and 12 points, respectively (the same as when you were in the pegging portion of the game). Sequences - say 6-7-8 - does not have to be the same suit count 1 point per card. Any combination of cards that add up to 15 count - a ""15"" is worth 2 points (even if it took all five cards to do it). So if you had a Jack, a Five, and two Fours, you would have 4 points. You would count this by saying ""fifteen-two and a pair is four."" And you would peg 4 points. 14. Now, if all four cards are the same suit, this is worth 4 points (in addition to any ""fifteens"" or sequences). And if the fifth card is also the same suit, that is one more point to make 5 points. 15. The hands are counted before the crib. First the non-dealer's hand, then the dealer's hand, then the dealer's crib. 16. NOTE: If all four cards in the crib are the same suit, no points can be taken unless the fifth card is also that same suit."	"And, as before, any ""fifteens"" are counted as previously described."

Introduce fruits and vegetables shortly after cereal. Conventional wisdom suggests that your baby gets used to cereal first, but many babies can start enjoying fruits and vegetables within a few weeks after starting cereal. * You can mix pureed fruits and vegetables into the cereal to give it a hint of flavor. This can be especially helpful if your baby starts turning his or her nose up at the cereal after being introduced to more flavorful foods. Since the cereal still contains nutrients your baby needs, mixing it with fruits and vegetables is a better alternative than leaving it out of your baby's diet. 2. Mix the cereal as you normally would. For instance, a five month old child may be getting 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of cereal with 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of breast milk or formula. 3. Add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pureed fruit or vegetable. You can gradually add more as your baby demonstrates improved swallowing ability and tolerance of the new food. * Start with mild orange and yellow vegetables, like sweet potatoes and carrots. Then, you can move onto green vegetables, like peas and green beans. * Try simple fruits like applesauce, peaches, and pears before moving onto more exotic fruits. * Introduce one new food at a time. If your baby has an allergic reaction to one food, you will need to be able to know which food it is. Introducing one new food at a time is the best way to accomplish that. 4. Wait three days before mixing in a different food.	Move to the next food, mixing it into the cereal at the same proportion and without another fruit or vegetable.

Choose some nice, mature Color! Spencer is mature, sophisticated, and intelligent, so her bedroom reflects that. Her bedroom has a simple color palate: gray and white with splashes of raspberry. If you don't like gray and prefer a more bold look, try black and white instead. I suggest white walls, a gray bedspread with a white pattern, a gray rug, and everything else in gray or white. For the color that adds that pop, choose raspberry throw pillows, curtains, and even some raspberry furniture. 2. Choose simple furniture, nothing too fancy. Make sure it's sophisticated too. If you want a cool look, go for iron tables and an iron headboard. But wood will work just fine. Make sure to have a desk- hey, Spencer needs somewhere to study for all her AP classes! And if your bedroom is big enough, try creating a ""sitting area"" like Spencer has- a collection of comfy chairs, a sofa, and maybe a coffee table is a great place to relax or chat with friends. Also, make sure to have a full-length mirror! It's totally glam, and gives you a cool place to check out your outfits! 3. Get some natural lighting. Of course you need a light, any style will do (though we suggest you stay away from pink lacy crystal lamps)."	Open your curtains and let some sun in!

It will get your mouth and fingers ready and it will also help you make sure your reed is in working order. * If you are not sure on the way to play a note, refer yourself to a fingering chart. * If you're not sure if you want to buy a clarinet yet, renting one is a very good option, especially if your music store has rent-to-own. * You need to clean your reed frequently, otherwise it will break. * As with any instrument, you should regularly have your clarinet inspected at your local music store to make sure nothing's wrong with it. * Be sure to keep your embouchure firm - your jaw should be flat and your mouth should be upturned. * Listen to professional clarinet players and try to sound and ""flow"" like them. Start with imitation and you will slowly develop your own unique sound. * If you're a more advanced player, you may want to upgrade to a higher quality wooden clarinet. Buffet and Selmer are both very popular clarinet brands that sell many great models. * Keep your clarinet in a room temperature area. If it gets too cold, it could sound flat. * Don't blow too hard or take too much mouthpiece into your mouth; it will make it more difficult to play and make you sound bad, not to mention the squeakiness that will be produced. * If sitting while playing, don't relax against the back of the chair, even if it is straight. Sit on the edge of your seat and sit up straight. Slumping can make you sound bad. * If you're in a school band like me, it's very possible that if you didn't start in beginning band, things could get difficult. I didn't start in 5th grade, but 7th. So you should ask other clarinet players for help. Don't be scared. When you're sitting down, in the chair at school or on a couch practicing at home, make sure to sit on the edge and with your back straight. Put the clarinet mouth peice like 3 centimeters in your mouth. You're teacher or classmates can help you with this. Then, gently blow into the instrument."	Make sure to dry your reed after using it. And that every section is in the right place. Lock the case when you've done that. When putting it back together, tighten the ligature, and put all the parts in the right place and practice the steps again. Lastly, use fingering charts! They're very helpful.

Mountain_Bike_Downhill.txt	Begin_Revision	0.919	### Controlling Your Bike Downhill	789	Once you master one trail , you can move onto more difficult ones .	### Prioritizing Safety as a Beginner	838	After you master one trail , you can move onto more difficult ones .	<replace><Once><1><After><1>	True	Controlling Your Bike Downhill  1. Start off on easier biking trails. Most mountain bike trails will have a grading system that signifies their difficulty. This grading system can usually be found at the start of a trail or at the park’s information booth. When first starting off, choose one of the lower difficulty trails so that you can get acclimated to biking downhill. * Lower level tracks will be relatively straight with limited curves and bumps. * Intermediate and advanced tracks may have steep drop-offs, narrow tracks, and obstacles blocking your way. * Only go down an advanced track if you're an experienced mountain biker. 2. Look further down the trail as you bike. Looking further down the trail will help you anticipate changes in the road and give you enough time to adjust accordingly. If you get distracted and concentrate too close in front of you, micro adjustments and hesitation could cause you to wipe out. 3. Commit to riding down the hill once you enter the decline. Hesitation could cause you to fall off your bike when going down a steep hill. Instead of second-guessing yourself, go fully into the hill and keep your wheels turning. Occasionally pump the brakes to slow down when you come to slight bends in the road, but don’t try to come to a complete stop until you're on level land. 4. Distribute your weight to the outside of the bike during turns. When you turn, your outside foot should be in the down position, your inside pedal should be up, and your weight should be distributed on the outside of your bike. This will prevent you from taking corners too sharply and falling off your bike. * Start braking early when you see a turn and look around the corner so that you can see what is in front of you. * On really steep hills, you can ride your rear tire break all the way through the turn. * Your weight should be evenly distributed between your front and back tire during turns. 5. Stop and examine an obstacle if it’s too difficult. It’s okay to stop the bike and walk it over a portion of the trail that you find too scary to do, like a steep drop off or an obstacle. Make sure that you walk on the side of the trail, out of the way of potential bikers behind you. * Examining an obstacle on a trail can actually help you better understand it the next time that you ride down the trail. 6. Drop your weight on the back of the bike when going down a steep hill. Hold the handlebars and lift your butt off your seat. Plant your heels down onto your pedals, adjust your hips, and drop your weight onto the back of your bike. This will prevent you from tipping over the handlebars when going down a steep hill. * Your arms should be slightly bent when going down steep hills. 7. Learn how to drop on a mountain bike. The drop technique will safely guide you over small cliffs as you ride downhill. When approaching a drop in terrain, you should be elevated over your seat, your chest should be lowered, and your arms and legs should be bent. As you go over the cliff, lower your hips, put your weight on the back of the bike and push off your handlebars. This will allow you to land and keep rolling after going over small cliffs. * Try to land on your back wheel or both wheels when doing this maneuver. * As you go over the drop your arms should be straight. 8. Gradually increase your speed on tracks you’re familiar with. Once you become more accustomed to the curves, bumps, and intricacies of a track or course, you can increase your speed on the track.	.

Clean your dog's ears. Dirty ears are a common source of unpleasant dog odors. Clean your dog's ears regularly to avoid or correct wax buildup, but not so regularly as to cause irritation. * Buy wipes, mineral oil, or ear cleaner like Oxyfresh Pet Ear Cleaner, available at any pet store. * Wipe the ear where wax is evident (generally a dark brown color) and through the different crevasses in the ear. If there is a strong odor to the ear, it is most likely an infection, not just wax, and should be addressed by a veterinarian and appropriate medication. * Ear infections are common in dogs and often accompany skin problems elsewhere on the dog’s body, so if your dog's ears show signs of infection such as odor, redness, swelling, or discharge, be vigilant for skin problems. * Both skin infections and ear infections are often caused by allergic reactions to foods or something in the environment like pollen. * Gently squirt the solution in the dog's ear and rub the ear in a circular motion. Or, better yet, use your thumb and middle finger to gently grasp the ear canal just below the ear opening and open and close your fingers to break up the ear debris with the help of the ear cleaning solution. * Dogs usually find this enjoyable and will often lean into the ear massage and groan with appreciation. * Lastly, use a cotton ball to gently wipe out any fluid from the ear canal. * Throughout this process, do not force anything down the canal. Do not use Q-tips. 2. Brush or comb your dog daily. This will remove some of the dirt and debris that may contribute to unpleasant dog odor. 3. Clean your dog's teeth. A dirty mouth leads to bad breath. For your dog's health and your own olfactory experience, you should brush your dog's teeth regularly, ideally on daily basis. * Find a dog toothbrush suitable for the size of your dog's mouth. You can buy these at any pet store, in pet catalogs, or from your veterinarian. Find a suitable toothpaste for dogs (don't ever use human toothpaste). Dog toothpastes are often flavored with such tasty flavors as beef or poultry. * Squirt a pea-sized amount of dog toothpaste on the toothbrush. * Gently move your dog's lip upward so you can see its teeth. * Brush all the teeth inside the mouth for about one minute. Be sure to get both sides of each tooth. * Some dogs will not take to tooth brushing with a toothbrush right away and will require training and slow introduction to the process. Start out with the dog toothpaste on your finger, then use a piece of gauze. When your dog is comfortable with that, move up to the toothbrush so that your dog can get used to the process gradually. * Don’t forget to treat your dog for their patience during this process. 4. Don't scent your dog. Avoid spraying perfume, scented, deodorizing or household products, like Febreeze®, on your dog. * These may temporarily mask the odor but won't remove it or address the cause.	.

Create a checklist. Write out the three purposes of a will: to distribute assets, nominate an executor to pay debts, and plan for minor children. Even if you don’t need a will to accomplish all three, you should give some time to thinking about each. * Your circumstances could change. Even if you have no assets now, you might in the future. Also, you may have children years after you draft the will. 2. Identify your assets. The primary purpose of a will is to transfer assets. Without a will, those assets will pass according to state law to your heirs (typically spouse and/or children). You should create a list of both specific and liquid assets. * Draft a list of specific assets by walking around your house. Note objects of value that people would want: vehicles, the house itself, art, and jewelry. * Draft a list of liquid assets. Liquid assets include savings accounts, checking accounts, cash deposits, and savings bonds. * Note that some assets may transfer outside of probate. For example, if you own a checking account or a house in joint tenancy with a spouse, your spouse will be the sole owner of the property once you die, even without a will. * Other assets also do not need to be transferred by a will.

Sift the powdered sugar into a bowl. Sifting is not absolutely necessary but will help keep your icing from getting lumpy. 2. Separate the egg whites into a separate bowl. Crack an egg and then turn it crack-side up. As you gently open it, use half of the shell to catch the yolk. Allow white to drain by transferring yolk from one half of the shell to the other several times. * Consider saving the yolk for homemade mayonnaise or Hollandaise sauce. 3. Combine lemon juice and egg whites and mix together briefly with a wire whisk. You don't have to whisk much or for long. Whisking for 20 seconds will help break up the egg whites and combine it with the lemon juice. 4. In a stand mixer, combine the lemon juice and egg white mixture with the sugar, adding the sugar a little at a time. Start with 1 1/2 cups or 2 cups of sugar, and gradually add the rest while the mixer is on its medium setting. Mix until shiny and opaque, about 5 minutes. * Hand mixers also do the trick just fine if you do not have a stand mixer. In a pinch, a little bit of old-fashioned elbow grease will work as well, although you'll be getting a considerable workout. * For edible construction projects like gingerbread houses, a thicker, more peanut-buttery consistency will provide extra stability. 5. For icing to be used as piping, mix the royal icing until soft peaks begin forming. Soft peaks are contoured without being firm; when you dip your whisk into the icing and turn it upside down, the peaks move back in on themselves. * To make your own icing tube, simply put the icing in a Ziploc bag and snip off one of the bottom corners. Start by cutting off very little of the corner to keep your icing lines thinner and more manageable. You can always snip more away as you go. 6. Continue mixing and adding sugar, 2 teaspoons at a time, for firmer peaks. If you want firm peaks for your icing, continue adding sugar a little bit at a time while the mixer is still beating. The additional sugar will create a stiffer icing. 7. Adjust as necessary with sugar, water, or egg whites. You probably have a pretty good idea of how you want your icing to turn out.	If you need to change the consistency of your icing — it's too stiff, for example — don't fret. Here's how you adjust the consistency of your icing:

Decide which type of panorama you are going to be photographing. Your options are a: Horizontal sequence, vertical sequence, or a clockwise (or counterclockwise) sequence. * The clockwise sequence would be if you wanted to create a square image versus an elongated image. 2. Decide on your lens. You could use a wide angle or a shorter focal length camera. This will enable you to end up with a 'taller' shot than you would get with a telephoto lens (it will have more height). 3. Put some thought into what is going to be the best orientation for the shot you want. 4. Use a tripod. If you have one with a panoramic head that is even better. Also, see if it has a level on it. This will help keep your images all even. 5. If your camera has the ability to lock the exposure (called AE Lock), then use it. This will keep the exposures from changing as you take the various images. 6. When shooting the images, try to avoid extremes in the exposure. Since you have it locked (if you do), you won't be able to adjust from dark to light in your shots. 7. Be sure the images overlap by a fair amount. 30 to 50% is considered a good number.	.
Perform_a_Five_Tone_Speed_Exercise_for_Piano.txt	Begin_Revision	0.953	## Steps	96	When you master this do the mirror of this with the LH playing the ratio while the RH only hits one note .	## Steps	124	Once you master this do the mirror of this with the LH playing the ratio while the RH only hits one note .	<replace><When><1><Once><1>	True	Steps  1. Major scale exercise - Starts with a step wise motion of these notes starting at the tonic, then a whole step, another whole step, a half step, and lastly a whole step up the keyboard before returning back, note-by-note to the tonic. It is customary for beginners to tap the last note twice. i.e. 1,2,3,4,5 then 5,4,3,2,1 but the aim is to play each note in even time 1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1. 2. Augmented scale exercise - Starts with a step wise motion of these notes starting at the same tonic as the major scale, then whole steps up the keyboard before returning back to the tonic. This will stretch your fingers and your ears until it becomes familiar. 3. Minor scale exercise – Starts with a step wise motion of these notes starting at the same tonic as the augmented scale, a whole step, a half step, a whole step and lastly a whole step before returning back to the tonic. This should look similar to the major scale except the 3rd note is flat with all other notes the same as the major. 4. Diminished scale exercise - Starts with a step wise motion of these notes starting at the same tonic as the minor scale, a whole step, a half step, a whole step and a half step before returning back to the tonic. This would complete one cycle and from this point you could repeat the same tonic or move chromatically up one 1/2 step to start a new cycle with a new tonic. There are twelve unique tones on the keyboard and this set of exercises teaches your fingers and your ears to become more comfortable with every key. 5. Ratios - This is a two-handed method to add on to the exercises and it will help with mastering different time signatures. More by familiarity through repetition so that the movement of different timings becomes natural. The ratio exercise starts with playing each of the four exercises above (Major, Augmented, Minor and Diminished) in unison for the first cycle. Then playing a ratio of the same step until both hands resolve on the tonic. So after the unison cycle, do a bi-cycle (2 notes on the RH to one on the LH), then do a tri-cycle (3 notes on the RH to one on the LH), and then a quad-cycle (4 notes on the RH to one on the LH).	After that move up chromatically to the next note.

Get ready for big changes. Moving to a place nothing like your home might give you a culture shock and make the move more difficult, but this will start to be overcome after a few months of immersion. People do things differently in different countries—that's why we call them ""foreign"" countries—and we are alien to their ways. Yet, this is the biggest and most amazing opportunity you'll ever have to open your mind and to seek to understand a different culture. Once you let yourself into the thinking of people from another country, you'll never go back; it's much harder to see the world as ""us and them"" once you know this experience. * If you're not familiar with the customs of the local people, do some research beforehand and get to know the ways as much as possible. It is better that you have a surface understanding than none at all—at least this gives you the opportunity to be understanding and to get more involved in cultural events and customs when you're in the new country. It will also help to ensure that you don't make mistakes that might cause affront. 2. Realize that small comforts lost may become bigger issues than you ever imagined. That favorite coffee drink you loved at home and that favorite place you used to visit can become glaringly obvious to you when they're missing from your life. It's important to acknowledge the sense of loss you feel but to remain open to finding favorite new experiences instead. The undiscovered may even herald favorite things you'll learn to love more than what you were used to in your original home country. * If you move from a country with a lot of choice in consumables to one with a lot less choice, you may find life challenging. No longer do you have the aisle of breakfast cereals (it's now down to a small rack) or the amazing choice in cars (you have either the blue or the gray one now). Initially, this can be extremely frustrating. You have two choices—one, accept it and realize that a lack of choice frees up thinking time and spares planetary resources, or two, travel back to your home country and buy up (or have understanding family and friends send you care packages). While for many people the lack of choice doesn't really fade with time (you'll find yourself reminiscing frequently about the days when you could get X item in X different styles) but you do get used to fewer choices! 3. Be ready for the bloom to fade after a few months. Initially, the first few months will feel like an amazing vacation and you'll spend a lot of it discovering things and feeling excited. However, eventually you'll realize that you're actually having a life there and it isn't half as exciting as you thought. For some, this realization can hit sooner rather than later, as bureaucracy, household maintenance issues and minor crises interrupt the flow of settling in. * Early on, ask about decent tradespeople. Sooner or later, something is going to break."	And if you haven't already lined up such people through asking others who do know, you're fair game for being taken advantage of, and overcharged. This can be a nightmare experience, and since you have the freedom to plan ahead rather than wait for the ax to fall, plan.

Gather your tributes. This should be self explanatory. Of course, it is extremely hard to find twelve boys and twelve girls to play at one time. If you can get 5-10 people, you have yourself the tributes. 3. Establish some rules. Tell each tribute the arena limits. If they pass the limit they immediately die. Also remember, the tributes can not step of their starting point until one minute after the games begin. If they do, they die.	After the two minutes, you are allowed to kill people.

Obtain the proper equipment. Snooker is played with 22, unnumbered object balls, divided into two groups of 15 red balls, 6 balls of different colors and one white ball (the cue ball). Each ball has a different point value: red=1, yellow=2, green=3, brown=4, blue=5, pink=6, and black=7. 2. Understand that you're trying to score a higher number of points than your opponent by potting the balls, i.e. sinking the red and the colored balls alternately into the table pockets. 3. Toss a coin to decide who is to play first. The first player has to cause the cue ball to contact a red ball. If he fails to do this, the other player tries. 4. The first player to cause the cue ball to contact a red ball continues by potting or touching one of the colored balls and then a red ball in sequence until he fails. Then, the turn moves to the other player, who has to pot a red then a colored ball in sequence until he fails. 5. Continue in that manner as long as there are still red balls on the table.	.

Place 2 black and 2 white discs at the center of the board. One player plays discs black side up and the other plays white side up. The less experienced player should play the black pieces because black goes first and this provides an advantage. Place 4 discs in the center of the board so that 2 are black side up and 2 are white side up. Arrange the discs with the matching colors diagonal to each other. * Distribute the remaining discs evenly between you and your opponent. 3. Set up the board to give the inexperienced player the advantage. To level the playing field between an experienced and inexperienced player, set up the board to give the inexperienced player an advantage.

To Fly or Drive I'm assuming that by now you have your destination already picked out, but how are you going to get there? Gas prices are near three dollars a gallon, and plane tickets are expensive, not to mention the very strict rules as to what you can and cannot take onboard. So to help with both here is what I recomend. 2. If you Drive- Ok so you've decided to drive, instead of eating your meals at McDonalds on your way to Vacation, pack a cooler of food. You can buy a cooler and a weeks worth of sandwhich suff for around 25-35 dollars. Get a tune up, I know that they can be expensive but a Tune up will help keep your car fuel efficient an could possibly save your life. Budget at least 20 over what you think you'll be paying in gas. 3. If you Fly- Travelocity, or other internet sites like Travelocity can help with finding a cheap rate. Flying at odd hours will ensure a cheaper ticket! When traveling around Europe I would always book my plane for around midnight because those flights offer the lower rates. What ever air line you book with, look up their site as well and see what their rules are as far as carry on material and flight exchanges or cancelations. You might be able to get a cheaper rate through the airline than through Travelocity, and you can save even more money by bring food with your carry on, so long as they allow it. In flight snack are expensive so if you can, pack your own. 4. Where to Sleep- My best advice on where to stay once you've reached your destination is to check hotel rooms and rates early, a few months in advance. The earlier you book a room the cheaper the rate.	.

I've been in the business for over 17 years now and I'm still amazed that: People don't buy the award winning prints that you see wearing many of the ribbons at professional photography conventions. When my clients are faced with the choice of buying an artistic pose of their child being demure and not looking directly into the camera or buying a pose smiling close-up straight into the camera, they buy the smiling close-up every time. Not very original, but I'm telling you now so take note: Happy people whose faces you can readily see are the most salable prints. They'll never tell you this at a photography workshop, seminar, Annual Convention or at a photography institute because their job is to create award winning photo artists rather than people whom simply make a living, but... if you haven't learned all the fancy lighting techniques, then you've saved time because the most important thing about light is having enough to keep the face out of the shadows. People prefer any kind of light, as long as there is enough of it to light the face and eyes so you can get a good look at the person! The quality of light people prefer for portraits is soft light, whether it be from an artificial source like a flash umbrella or a natural source from the sky at sunset, but other than a soft quality of light they want enough of it to SEE the face of the person you're photographing, even if it is a flat almost straight on technique. You may not win any competitions or awards this way, but if you get plenty of light on the faces you'll create salable prints. This leads me to talk about fill flash. There are times outdoors when you'll need a flash on your camera to fill in dark shadow areas mostly in the eye sockets. Just use one f stop less flash than the existing ambient light calls for. That's enough light to fill the shadows and don't worry about not lugging around a portable umbrella to get the perfect modeling technique. My mentor is right again: there is no change in the sale. The customer pays for well lit faces, not perfect modeling. I've tried it both ways and the customer buys the same amount of pictures in the same sizes no matter what you do. Element number Two: Body Positioning. This is a little more detailed area, but it is important, believe me. My basic education from my mentor began with the same advice I'll pass on to you: You should rarely photograph anyone straight on. The exception to this rule will be for family and large groups, which for reasons of body placement will often break this rule. But for individuals or smaller groups of people this rule applies. Now, when you're not just photographing a head and shoulders close-up you'll have to understand other aspects of body positioning that makes people want to buy their pictures. Hands. They should always be turned slightly so they are seen from the edge with fingers together, or hide the hands altogether behind your subject or somebody else next to them. Never position hands straight on with open fingers. Simply put, anything that minimizes how much hand you see works to make it a better portrait. This is always more flattering in a portrait and you'll see they are the ones people buy. Crossing legs at the ankles refines the pose and minimizes this area of the body making it more appealing. Look at it this way, what's less of a distraction: two legs leading to two ankles leading to two feet -- or two legs blending into one ankle section with blended feet? Surely it's the latter. When standing, one cannot simply cross their ankles unless they have something to lean against, so I will have one foot in front of the other in such a way that they taper into one general unit. Have them place their weight on the back leg (remember, they are at a slight 3/4 angle) and bring the front leg forward and slightly tilt the foot to face out toward the camera. Whenever I'd show my mentor my portraits that I was just unsure of, it was these recurring themes that he patiently pointed out to me. As I began to look for these simple things during my portrait sessions, my pictures got better! I can't stress enough how basic, but important, it is to watch for these details. I have people come to me who went to the contract photographer for their High School Senior yearbook portrait and disliked their picture. They want me to take one that they can proudly give out to friends and family. Usually the problem with the pictures I've seen is that the photography school graduate �intern� who works for the contract photographer took the photo without paying attention to some minor detail. I get it right and my reputation grows from �fixing� the contract photographer's mistake. The techniques for salable body positioning are what you look for in any pose you try whether close-up or full body. When photographing people full body standing, seated or reclining on the ground, noticing body angle, hands and feet is the way to �fine tune� your portrait and distinguish it from just a �snapshot�. Lastly, I must share my favorite body positioning tool that makes it so easy to make a better portrait than someone who doesn't really know what they're doing: the head tilt. A woman alone tilts her head just slightly in either direction to make a more stunning portrait. A man's head can stay straight up or tilt slightly away in the opposite direction from his most forward shoulder but never back towards his most forward shoulder. Element number Three: Salable Composition There are many compositional techniques in many books, but it doesn't take all that knowledge to make portrait compositions that are what the typical consumer considers good enough to call professional. Once you know what the consumer considers salable, you will be able to reproduce it again and again for other clients. You also will thank me for saving you from thinking that in order to be good enough to sell portrait photography you have to create grand artistic images. You just have to know what works and be able to repeat it for the friends of your clients whom will be getting your business cards by way of referral. When photographing one individual person, it's so simple I don't think you need too much input for that. In fact, I believe you know the naive simplicity with which you thought �hey, I can do this for a living� after taking some portraits of a friend or family member."	.

Be aware if you're at risk. Although anybody can catch scabies, certain people are more susceptible than others. Below is the list of people who are more likely to catch scabies. * Children * Mothers of young children * Sexually active young adults * People living in nursing homes or similar environments 2. Avoid contact with the mites. There are two definite ways to get scabies, and knowing what they are can help you avoid them: * Prolonged contact with a surface containing the itch mites that cause scabies, such as a towel, bedding, furniture, or similar items, will cause the mites to burrow into your skin. * Skin-to-skin contact with an affected individual. This contact has to be prolonged as well, so a simple handshake, hug, or other quick physical gesture won't cause it. Most often, it is spread from skin-to-skin contact between adults during sexual intercourse. 3. Identify the symptoms. There are several symptoms of scabies, and they can range from minor to extreme. Knowing the symptoms won't necessarily help you avoid catching them, but they can help you know if you need to move on to curing them. * Itching: Mainly, the itching persists at night. It is the most common symptom, and can be so intense that it keeps the individual awake at night. * Rash: Many people affected by scabies get the rash. It appears as little bumps, usually in a line, and can look like tiny bites, knots, or even pimples. Many people have confused the rash with eczema because of the similarities. * Sores: These are only caused by intense scratching. After the sores have developed, the risk of infection greatly increases. * Thick crusts on the skin: This forms from a severe type of scabies. These crusts hold 100s and even thousands of mites, along with their eggs, and greatly increase the itch, as well as making the rash more extreme. 4. Look out for particular spots. Understand that there are particular areas scabies tend to form, because the mites prefer them over the rest of the body. * Hands: Between the fingers and around the nails * Arms: On the elbows and the wrists * Skin covered by clothing: Most commonly, the belt line, penis, buttocks and skin surrounding the nipples have been affected.	.

When I buy a project, I leave the closing table and go directly to the property and secure the place by putting new locksets in at least one entry door, and barricade the other exterior doors and windows that will not lock. From this point forward you need to know that your tools, building materials, and future improvements are safe from vandals. 2. For the most part, the neighbors and police department watch over the place. I notify the police department right away that I am cleaning up the property and would like extra patrol. They are always willing to do this because house rehabbing makes for a nicer looking neighborhood which draws better residents and that makes their job easier. I also leave all exterior lights on 24/7 so everyone can have good visibility of the exterior of the home. 3. These 10 steps are a good order of process to follow when house rehabbing, with a few extra specifics. Of course you will find small repairs in between these steps but they are very minor. 4. Step 1 of house rehabbing is to do a quick clean up of the debris on the outside of the home. There are two important reasons for this; 5. It makes the neighbors pleased with you. 6. It gives the building inspector less reason to take notice of your property. 7. I ALWAYS do the home remodeling work to the interior of the home before doing any noticeable work on the exterior. The only exception is if the roof is actually leaking and if this is the case, you should try to cheaply patch it (without using a obnoxious tarp) to get by until the interior is nearly done. You should also hang some fabric over the windows. You do not want to attract attention to your house rehabbing activities. 8. It is not that you want to do substandard work. You just want to be able to do your house rehabbing work efficiently without the local inspector getting in the way causing delays. As to the quality of the home remodeling work performed, I say if something is questionable, replace it. When I started out I did a couple questionable repairs to get by with less expense. It didn't take long to figure out that half-assed repairs hurt the resale of the property. When you figure in the cost of replacing an item verses repairing it, what you end up with in the end is well worth the extra cost of replacement. Usually when you factor in the time it takes to try to butter something together, you find it was more expensive than if you had replaced it with new. The home shows great and sells or rents fast when it looks new.	.

Each investment advisor has two basic choices in structuring the fund: you can either run your hedge fund as the sole proprietor, or you can create a corporation to partner with you and limit your own liability. It's most common to protect yourself from liability by creating a corporation to act as the general partner of your fund entity. This will be your investment advisory company. * Fill out the articles of incorporation in your state and get an FEIN for your new advisory company from the IRS. 2. Write your corporate bylaws. Your new investment advisory firm will need to complete its in-house rulebook to move forward with incorporation and register with the SEC and the regulatory bodies in your state. The bylaws will depend largely on you, but might commonly include: * A compliance manual * An ethical code of conduct * A manual for supervisory procedures * An advisor portfolio management agreement 3. Lawyer up. It's usually best, when you're in the middle of incorporation, to hire a law firm to guide you through the process. It's not especially difficult to do yourself, but it's usually advisable to establish contact with a group of lawyers experienced in financial law who'll be able to help you down the road. Not the time for a silly paperwork slip up that could cost you. Consult the experts. 4. Register your company as the Registered Investment Advisor (RIA). Do this on the website of the Investment Advisor Registration Depository (IARD) to make the partnership legal. The process is completely free, but will take probably a few hours to negotiate. You may want to speak to your legal team before moving forward with the process of registry. 5. Register yourself as the Investment Advisor Representative (IAR). At the same time, you'll also want to register yourself as the Investment advisor for the fund, which you can do online at the same website. To complete the process, you'll need to complete and submit a Form U-4 and pay the fee to the IARD. 6. Register the fund offering with the SEC. Hedge funds don’t technically register with the SEC, but register the ""offering"" of the limited partnership."	.

You can read it in two modes using these simple steps. The idea of the binary clock is simple. Instead of displaying numbers in base 10 (which most people are used to), it uses binary (base 2) which only uses 1s and 0s.	"""On"" signifies a 1 and ""Off"" means 0. Reading the clock is only a matter of converting the binary value to decimal."

First and foremost every person born has the right to respect and fair treatment. You must deal with your anxieties, anger or frustration before you are able to care for another. 2. Kids with Aspergers have special needs they can range from poor social interactions to not being able to verbalize. The tips given are general and like mentioned above you will need to tailor them to your child. 3. First it is important for any child to have a routine. Everyday should be similar if you can hand a calendar with pictures it would be helpful to the older child. Any last minute items (appointments, guests) should be brought up in a frank manner. This way the child does not let their anxieties build up. 4. Relaxation is a hard skill to teach. The next best thing is a type of breathing called ""box breathing"" You inhale for a count of 4, hold your breath for 4 seconds (if possible) and slowly exhale for a count of 4. Then you pause for 4 seconds before you inhale again. This process allows the child or caregiver to count which in itself can be relaxing. 5. Learn what the child loves to do whether it is reading about animals, building blocks. Never try to stop them just ask them questions about it if possible. This shows interest and builds a trust bond between the child. If the child is unable to talk, just being a silent supporter means more than you can imagine. 6. It is also extremely important you are able to identify their areas of growth. For example, if you notice they are not confident in social situations. Try role playing with your child on how to start conversations and talk about basic things such as weather and interests. Also teach them how to recognize social cues such as boredom or anger in others. Role play is crucial, it really gives kids a mock trial of what to expect. Be real, throw them a curveball and see what they do. This type of play is excellent when teaching kids how to deal with bullies. 7. Teaching independence to higher functioning asperger children is crucial. Treat them no different from any child their age. Give them responsibilities around the house like cooking or cleaning. SELF CARE is an area that aspergers kids really lack. Not that they are dirty they just don't see the importance of taking a bath. Teaching them to take care of themselves is a life long skill. Having a routine is crucial, even writing down the step and taping them to the bathroom mirror is a good way to ensure they get done. 8. Try not to label kids and describe them as Aspergers. They must learn they are no different and are able to achieve as much as they put their minds to. For kids who are higher needs it is important you learn to take care of yourself and reach out to support groups so you can get the help you need. 9. Talking to kids about current events will keep them up to date with the latest. Also teaching them the reasons behind the behaviours of others will give them an insight into how emotions can affect a person. 10. inviting classmates over for playdates is a good way for your kid to practice their social skills in a less threatening environment. You can slowly increase the number of kids as your child gets better."	Teaching kids to go out on the limb and taking risks is important to build confidence.

Children are the most vulnerable to UVA and UVB rays, and even if you use a sunblock that provides protection from both types you should be vigilant every time that your children are out in the sun. 2. Sun-protective clothing, hats and good quality sunglasses (‘European Standard’) are probably the best way to protect from UV rays while out in the sunshine but of course you can’t keep them covered head to foot this way all the time! If they are going to be exposed to sunshine be sure to use a sunblock or sunscreen. 3.	Go for an SPF 30 and apply it liberally about 20 minutes before exposure to the sun. Reapply regularly, particularly if your child is playing with water which will amplify the sun’s rays. Even if the bottle says that the product is water resistant you should use it often.

Collect all the ingredients you'd like to use in your potpourri. If your dead flower arrangement is limited or unvaried in color, you can augment the petals with other plants when making homemade potpourri. Flower petals from different flowers work well, as do herbs like rosemary, thyme, and sage. For a spicier scent, try adding ingredients like cinnamon, clove, and star anise. 2. Spread the dead flowers out to dry. After gathering all your potpourri ingredients, you need to dry them thoroughly to prevent mold growth. Flowers and herbs in varying degrees of freshness can be laid out in a single, loose layer on a baking sheet. Try to avoid allowing them to touch. If you need a larger area, you can lay the flowers out on sheets of newspaper or on a counter. As long as the surface is completely smooth it should work fine. 3. Place the dead flowers in a suitable location for drying. To dry without rotting, the flowers and herbs should be placed in a location that is dry, dark, cool, and well-ventilated. Ventilation is key, as it is crucial to removing moisture from the flowers and mitigating bacterial or fungal growth. Most flowers and herbs will be thoroughly dry after about two weeks if placed in an ideal location. 4. Mix your potpourri together. Once dried, place your flower petals and sprigs of herbs into a large mixing bowl. To increase the fragrance of the potpourri, you'll want to add varying essential oils to the mix. *	Orris root is the root of a type of Iris, and it serves as a fixative for essential oils; the oils are absorbed into the root and very slowly released back into the air as fragrance.

Understand that the safest way to remove a mole is by going to a doctor. A doctor will be able to look at the mole and see whether it's a harmless mole, or a potentially cancerous mole. You can try to remove a mole at home using common household items, but the safest, most effective way is surgery, unfortunately. Surgery involves either: * Excision with cauterization. The mole is shaved off at the level of the rest of your skin and the doctor cauterizes the skin afterward. * Excision with stitches. The mole is cut off under and around the skin, and stitches are used to close up the wound afterward. 2. Understand that home treatments to remove moles may result in skin damage, scarring or possible infection. If you plan on trying to remove a mole or moles on your own, without the help of a doctor, know first that these procedures may backfire. There's a reason your doctor uses surgery to remove moles (it works); it ends up being a lot less dangerous in the right hands than other methods. * Understand that moles aren't ugly or unsightly. Many people, especially teens, think that their moles are nasty or hard to look at. In fact, many more people hardly notice moles, or think that moles look cute or are sexy. (Take a look at Cindy Crawford.) * Think twice before trying to remove a mole on your face. Removing a mole can be a painful process. The skin around the mole becomes red and inflamed, and could even scar as the mole is removed. Having a huge scar in the middle of your cheek or forehead is surely worse than having a mole. * Test on small, hidden moles first. Instead of automatically going for the biggest, most visible mole first, try removing a smaller mole with one of the methods below. If the method works, that's great: give it a try elsewhere. If it doesn't, you can let the mole heal again and no one should know that the procedure failed. 3. Use apple cider vinegar. This is an inexpensive way to get rid of a mole leaving no scar. Put a few drops of apple cider vinegar on a cotton ball. Put the cotton ball on the mole and wrap a bandage around it. Leave the bandage on for an hour. Do this everyday until the mole falls off or disappears. 4. Use 5% iodine solution. While Iodine is not readily available over the counter in some countries, it can be an effective mole zapper. Caution: iodine is toxic in large quantities. If you do choose to use iodine to help remove a mole, do not ingest it. * Apply a drop of iodine onto the mole twice a day and cover with a band-aid. (Apply once in the morning and once at night.) After about a week, the mole should begin to come off. 5. Use garlic. Take a clove of garlic. Slice it in half. Put the half piece of garlic on the mole and leave it overnight wrapped in a bandage. Do this several days to remove the mole. 6. Use banana peels. Peel the peels off a banana. Make sure that the inside of the peel is in contact with the mole. Do this several days. The peel theoretically will dry up the mole until it falls off. 7. Use mole removal cream with caution. Mole removal creams are more expensive than many of these household items, but still cheaper than surgery.	They can leave pits in your skin and cause scarring that's more noticeable than the mole was in the first place. If you choose to use mole removal cream, follow instructions exactly.

Show_Love_to_a_Partner.txt	Begin_Revision	0.965	### Communicating in Love	1101	But , do n't take your frustration out on him or her by shutting down things your partner says because you are feeling irritable or are n't paying attention .	### Communicating in Love	1178	However , do n't take your frustration out on him or her by shutting down things your partner says because you are feeling irritable or are n't paying attention .	<replace><But><1><However><1>	True	Communicating in Love  1. Appreciate your partner in the things they do, and compliment him or her. Tell your partner how attractive you find them. Tell them they are beautiful or handsome, and also tell them the little things you find sexy or cute about them. For example, if you are walking somewhere you have never been in a new city with your partner, and he or she finds the way to get to where you need to go without any problem, tell him or her, “I think your sense of direction is sexy.” * If your partner has done something for you- thank him or her for it. Write a little note of thanks for him or her and put it in their bag. Or you can send a text message that tells him or her how much you appreciate what they did with a picture of you looking silly and happy. 2. Show your love with your sense of humor. Tease your partner and notice the little things that they do. And always laugh at your partner’s jokes or tease him or her for the joke, and encourage your partner when he or she is being silly. If your partner has painted her or his toenails, for example, you can ask something silly like, “Have your toenails always been that enchanting color?”. Or ask your partner funny questions about his or her opinions on things. You can ask something like, “So what is your favorite kind of apple?”. And then playfully make fun of his or her choice. The more you make humor a part of your relationship, the more comfortable and fun you can be together. * You can make funny observations to your partner based on what is going on or where you are. Look around at the environment that you are in, and say something about it that is exaggerated, or point out something curious. For example, if your car is really cluttered and you are giving your partner a ride somewhere, you can ask, “So are you going to break up with me now because of my car?” 3. Listen to your partner talk about his or her troubles and joys. Be your partner’s emotional support. Encourage your partner to tell you the things he or she cares about and about the emotional ups and downs he or she goes through. You can ask your partner something like, “So how have you really been lately?”. When things are hard for your partner, remind him or her of the things that he or she has done well and all the ways things are going to be okay. Tell your partner that you are there for him or her. * Try to accept your partner for who he or she is, including both the good and the bad. Realize his or her faults as well as their strengths, and love him or her for the whole thing. * Be prepared to forgive your partner for the mistakes he or she makes, and be ready to encourage him or her to keep trying. Also try to be forgiving because you are going to make mistakes, too. * Don’t try to change your partner. If you are trying to change your partner, you won’t be able to fully love him or her because you will be worried about changing him or her. 4. Tell your partner you love him or her often. Your partner needs to hear these reassuring words from you often. You can also vary “I love you” with, “I like you” to change things or give more power to the word love. Say I like you or I love you out loud when you see them do something that you enjoy or are proud of. Your partner will appreciate hearing you voice your love in a variety of places and for a variety of reasons. Try to be unexpected with it sometimes, for example, when you are standing in line at a grocery store with your partner, you can whisper “I love you” in your partner’s ear before they go up to pay. * Send a random text that says “I love you.” to your partner when you are thinking about how much you love your partner and tell him or her how or why you thought of it. * Sometimes people say “I love you” so often that it loses its meaning. Be careful saying I love you so often that it loses its power. 5. Ask your partner for feedback in your relationship. One of the best ways to learn how to show someone love is to ask what is working for him or her. You can’t read your partner’s mind and sometimes the best way to show your partner love is to talk directly about how things are going. Whether it is in sex or in your relationship- you should check in with your partner every so often to ask him or her for feedback. Every couple of months, ask your partner to have a conversation about your relationship. Find a time and place you can have a real conversation. This can also happen on special dates when you are at dinner or having a drink. You can say something like, “I want to know how you are feeling about our relationship so we can make our relationship even better.” * Ask your partner something like, “What do you like about our relationship, and what can I do better to show my love for you?”. * Share your feelings and feedback about the relationship with your partner. Tell your partner the good things that you have enjoyed in your relationship, and also tell him or her the things that he or she could do to make you feel even more loved. * Consider having these dates regularly if you are in a long term relationship. 6. Don’t shut your partner down in conversation. Often in relationships, it is hard to stay patient with your partner because you spend a lot of time with him or her. Or when you are together, you are busy or stressed.	For example, if your partner says to you something like “I don’t know what I should get.” when you are ordering food, don’t ignore your partner because you are frustrated. It can be easy to snap and say something like, “You never know what to get.” or say nothing at all. But work instead on saying something helpful in response like, “What did you get last time?”, or you can be playful and kiss her or him on the cheek to acknowledge him or her.
Select_a_Show_Rabbit.txt	Begin_Revision	0.943	## Steps	2834	When you decide to buy the rabbit , ask the breeder to tattoo it in its left ear .	### Selecting a Specific Rabbit	2916	Once you decide to buy the rabbit , ask the breeder to tattoo it in its left ear .	<replace><When><1><Once><1>	True	Steps  1. Buy the ARBA Standard of Perfection. This book describes every recognized breed and what it should look like. This will prevent you from getting a rabbit that will not do well on the show tables. 2. Select the breed best suited for your level of expertise and accommodations. The small-sized breeds (3 ½ -- 6 lbs) are easier to handle for beginners, use less cage space and eat less food than the bigger breeds. They are a good choice to start with. Do not start with dwarf breeds unless you are near to a competent breeder who can help you. These require skill to handle, breed and pose, and can be more challenging to the beginner. Some of the small-sized breeds are as follows: * Dutch * Mini Rex * Britannia * Holland Lop * Polish * Netherland Dwarf * Lionhead 3. Look at your state’s rabbit club website and find breeder listings for your area. Call them up, find out if they have rabbits for sale, and go visit them. 4. First impressions count. Is their rabbitry clean, organized and well-kept? Or is it dirty, smelly and full of unhealthy rabbits? You do not want to buy from the breeder. 5. Ask to see the rabbit(s) for sale. Check the fur. In most breeds, the hair should snap back into position when you stroke it backwards (tail to head). Some breeds have rollback fur. Check the Standard of Perfection or the ARBA website for rules on fur. 6. Check the face. Eyes should be clean, free of discharge and bright. The nose should not be runny. Its top teeth should overlap its bottom teeth, and its ears should be parasite and wax free. 7. Its back should be strong and firm, not bony, lumpy or crooked. Some rabbits have different shaped backs and may feel skinnier than others, so check the Standard of Perfection (SOP) or ARBA website for the details. 8. The legs should be straight. Every rabbit should have five toes on the front feet and four on the back feet. All the toenails should be present. There should be white toenails on white breeds and varieties and colored toenails on colored breeds or varieties. (Check the ARBA SOP for exceptions.) 9. The rabbit’s body should be firm, not soft and flabby. In a junior animal, it might not be very firm, but still be a good specimen. It is just not mature yet. 10. The tail should be straight. 11. Check to be sure the color is correct. If it is a “band” or “agouti” color, blow into its fur to see the ring pattern. (Check the ARBA SOP for more details) Check that the under-color (color of its belly) is correct, and that all markings are the right size, shape, and color. Check eye color. 12. The rabbit should have firm, dry stools and quiet breathing. There should be no signs of illness or injury. Rabbits do get pee stains on their feet, it does not mean they're sick! 13. If everything checks out, ask to see the rabbit’s pedigree. Ask to see (if possible) its parents and litter mates. Ask about any Best in Show, Best of Breed, or Best of Variety wins. If there is a history of winning in the pedigree, odds are you have a rabbit that could win. It doesn’t always work out that way, but it is an extra measure to partially ensure success. 14. Check the rabbit’s temperament. Is it friendly? Does it come and greet you , or run and hide? Does it pose for the judges? Does it bite and/or scratch? Will it allow you to flip it over? These won’t necessarily make or break a champion, but you and the judges will have a much happier time with your rabbit if it is friendly. 15.	Most breeders do it themselves. You must have a tattooed number or letter sequence if you are to show in ARBA shows. This gets written on the pedigree so you can identify your rabbits easily. At rabbits shows, there may be eighty rabbits of the same breed and color, and you don’t want to get yours swapped up with someone else’s!
Store_Whiskey.txt	Begin_Revision	0.795	### Storing Whiskey in Unopened Bottles	65	On the other hand , a cork that is completely dry may crumble or chip when you open the bottle .	### Storing Whiskey in Unopened Bottles	109	However , a cork that is completely dry may crumble or chip when you open the bottle .	<delete><On><1>|||<delete><the><2>|||<delete><other><3>|||<replace><hand><4><However><1>	True	Storing Whiskey in Unopened Bottles  1. Protect your bottles from direct light. Exposure to a lot of light—especially sunlight—sets off chemical reactions that will both discolor your whiskey and affect its flavor. Keep your whiskey in a dark area, such as a wine cellar, cupboard, box, or darkened pantry. * If you are a collector or retailer interested in showing off your bottles, keep in mind that exposure to direct sunlight will also cause the label to fade. * If you must show off your whiskey some place where it will be exposed to light, consider placing it behind a window with a UV-blocking coating. 2. Keep your bottles in a place with cool, stable temperatures. Temperature fluctuations, and especially exposure to heat, can affect the quality of your whiskey. When whiskey gets hot, it expands in the bottle, which can eventually damage the seal and let in oxygen. Keep your whiskey in a cool, temperature-controlled room or container. * Try to store your whiskey in an area where the temperature stays between 15 and 20° C (59-68° F). * Refrigerating your whiskey or storing it in the freezer will not hurt it, but whiskey is less flavorful and aromatic when it is cold. * If you’re concerned about keeping your bottles looking nice, it’s also a good idea to store them in an area with low humidity. Too much humidity can damage the label. 3. Store your bottles upright. Always keep your whiskey bottles in a vertical position. If stored horizontally or upside-down, your whiskey will constantly be in contact with the cork, eventually causing the cork to deteriorate. This can affect the taste of your whiskey and allow oxygen to leak into the bottle. *	Keep your cork moist by turning the bottle upside-down for a few seconds once a month.
Set_Rewarding_Goals.txt	Begin_Revision	0.927	## Steps	53	but consider goals such as being able to run for (x) amount of miles or time and still being in good condition at the end of it .	## Steps	107	However , consider goals such as being able to run for (x) amount of miles or time and still being in good condition at the end of it .	<insert><However><1>|||<replace><but><1><,><2>	True	Steps  1. Consider those goals related to finance. People tend to avoid financial goals because it makes them face a part of their life that they often want to ignore, however setting financial goals and striving for them can be one of the most regarding things a person can ever do. Consider goals that will bring the most relief and joy such as: Being debt free. Having wealth. Owning property. Having emergency funds. Having liquidatable assets. Having adequate insurance. Having a good savings plan. Having a well though out budget. These kinds of goals enable you to search for extra ways to earn money such as setting up passive income methods or putting in an extra shift at work, as well as making you more disciplined with your finances and avoiding expenditure which is unrewarding or pointless. 2. Consider those goals related to work and career. Your career determines a lot of what you are going to be doing with your time and so it is important to set goals which are appropriate for you specifically. Many people do not set career goals instead they just hope that these things will happen on their own - which is often unlikely as some effort has to be done in order to make them happen. These may include: Make more money for working less time. Getting a promotion. Making a career change to something you enjoy (which may involve some part time study and education). Getting a job that has many perks. getting a job that is more rewarding to the soul. Making new contacts. Getting new qualifications through paid training that allow you to ascend the metaphorical career ladder. Starting your own consultancy firm in your free time using your expertise from your field of work. In doing these kinds of things your career opportunities expand and grow, and you spend the time in your career in greater happiness, wealth and prosperity. 3. Consider those goals related to friends. Friends are important to consider in your goals because they provide a support network and people by which to enjoy this life with as well as people to care for other than yourself which can be very rewarding. you can set general goals with friend that can eventually manifest into specific goals such as: create good and positive memories. or you can set more refined goals such as - Make more friends, learn how to distinguish a good friend from a bad friend, improve my social skills, improve my perception of how to genuinely help my friends, improve my friends' lives by teaching them what I know, helping them in their careers, giving them useful things, introducing them to good people. 4. Consider those goals which are related to intellectual development. Human beings have a documented need to be intellectually challenged and stimulated this means that a set of goals can be established in order to enhance intelligence. Consider things such as the following: choosing a new subject to learn about. Completing a short or long term course of study that allows for recognized qualification. Learning a new thing about that specific subject everyday until you are knowledgeable in that subject. Creating a bookshelf with books related to that topic. Devoting some time everyday where you would otherwise be doing nothing to study of that subject for the sake of mental development and the gaining of knowledge. finding a good teacher in that subject in order to learn faster. 5. Consider those goals related to humanitarian pursuits. We are all inclined on some level to help others but we seldom make goals as to how we can do that. Making goals that are humanitarian can allow these things to come about far easier and you can end up helping a lot of people as a result. when setting humanitarian goals bear two things in mind: first is that you cannot help everyone in the world, second is that you can generally help many people in a small way or few people in a big way, simply due to the amount of time and energy you can devote to each its very rare that you can help many people in a big way (though not impossible). You can do both and both are worthwhile so its important to consider these kinds of things when deciding on goals. So consider first a type of person that needs help or aid such as homeless people, illiterate people, suicidal people, children, teenagers, hungry people, people without good role models, disabled people. Then determine the kind of help that you can give to them: Creating care packages for the homeless, teaching illiterate people how to read and write, donating (x) amount of money per month to a charity that helps suicidal people, being a good positive role model to one of your child cousins or nephews. Helping teenagers make good life decisions and teaching them how to be less self destructive. 6. Consider those goals related to physical training and fitness. Your physical training often gives you a kind of discipline and allows you to deal with the things you will encounter in life with strength and wellness rather than weakness, lethargy and sickness. Goals you set with regards to your physical training may be aesthetic or functional - try to go for function first since it determines a lot of your physical abilities.	being able to lift heavier weights or do more repetitions, being able to flawlessly execute certain gymnastic or parkour type maneuvers, being able to jump further, run faster and be more flexible. developing excellence and proficiency in martial arts, proficiency in sports - such has being able to score points consistently or in a faster time in your sport of choice.

It's okay to be a little corny and scared, girls appreciate it when they can tell you're a little nervous. They think it is sweet and it calms them down a lot. (Seriously, you thought only you get nervous... Girls get very scared also, but they tend not to show it.) 3. Bring them to a chick flick, or a scary movie.

Worst comes to worst, you see a boring movie with a pretty girl by your side; it's not that bad.
Reduce_ESR.txt	Begin_Revision	0.961	### Getting an ESR Test	670	Since an elevated ESR is often associated with chronic pain or inflammation , your doctor may want you to come in for a regular check up .	### Dealing with Elevated ESR Test Results	735	Because an elevated ESR is often associated with chronic pain or inflammation , your doctor may want you to come in for a regular check up .	<replace><Since><1><Because><1>	True	Getting an ESR Test  1. Visit your doctor if you think you need an ESR test. An ESR test is most commonly used to see if there’s inflammation in your body that’s causing you to be in pain. If you have unexplained fevers, arthritis, muscle pain, or visible inflammation, an ESR test can help your doctor better understand the source and severity of these issues. * An ESR test might also be useful in diagnosing unexplained symptoms like a poor appetite, unexplained weight loss, headaches, or shoulder and neck pain. * An ESR test is rarely done on its own. At the very least, your doctor will probably also order a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. This test is also used to check for inflammation in the body. 2. Discuss any medications you’re on with your doctor. There are several different over-the-counter and prescription drugs that could either elevate or lower your natural ESR level. If you’re on any of these meds, your doctor may ask you to stop taking them up to a week before you take the test. Do not change your medications without consulting your doctor. * Dextran, methyldopa, oral contraceptives, penicillamine procainamide, theophylline, and vitamin A can increase ESR. * Aspirin, cortisone, and quinine could lower your ESR level. 3. Decide if you need a ride to the test. If you don’t mind blood tests, you should be able to drive yourself. However, if you experience faintness or lightheadedness during blood draws, have a friend or family member drive you. It’s also important to have a buddy drive you if your health isn’t great. * Tell the person who’s drawing your blood about your past experiences with these types of tests. They may lay you down to keep you from getting hurt if you faint. 4. Tell the health professional which arm you’d like blood drawn from. Usually, blood will be drawn from the crook of your elbow. While there shouldn’t be much pain or swelling after this test, you may want to ask if blood can be drawn from your non-dominant arm. The health care professional will also want to look for the best veins. * Choosing a good vein will cause the test to go a bit faster. * If your health professional can’t find a good vein in either arm, they may look for another spot to draw from. 5. Remain relaxed while your blood is drawn. The health care professional will tie an elastic band around your upper arm and swab the draw site with alcohol. Then they’ll insert a needle into the vein and drain your blood into a tube. Finally, they’ll remove the needle and release the elastic. * If you’re nervous, don’t look at your arm while your blood is being drawn. * They may need to fill more than one tube. Don’t be alarmed if this happens. 6. Apply pressure to the draw site. The nurse or doctor will give you a small gauze pad and ask you to put pressure on the spot. They’ll want to label and store the tube(s) right away. Once that’s finished, they’ll remove the pressure and give you a small bandage. * They may use also a compression bandage to keep the pressure on and stop the bleeding more quickly after you leave the office. You can remove this bandage at home after a few hours have passed. 7. Expect some bruising or redness. In most cases, blood draw site will heal in just a day or 2. It may appear a bit red or even bruised as it’s healing. This is normal. 8. Make a warm compress if the vein appears swollen. In rare cases, the vein used for the test may become swollen. This isn’t serious, but it might be painful. Heat up a damp washcloth in the microwave for 30-60 seconds. Apply it to the site in 20-minute sessions a few times per day. * Test the washcloth’s temperature by hovering your hand over it. If the steam coming off the cloth is too hot for you to hold your hand above it, wait 10-15 seconds before testing the temperature again. 9. Contact your doctor if you develop a fever. If the pain and swelling at the blood draw site gets worse, you may be developing an infection. This is a very rare reaction. However, if you do develop a fever, contact your doctor right away. * If you have a fever of 103℉ (39℃) or higher, your doctor may recommend that you go to the emergency room. 10. Get your ESR tested over time to check your levels.	Monitoring your ESR level during these routine visits will allow them to keep an eye on your pain and the inflammation in your body. Hopefully, with the right treatment plan, it’ll be going down!

Just be yourself. Don't be afraid to express your opinions. If someone insults you, just ignore them - they have no idea what they're talking about! 2. Be Optimistic. Even if you are feeling really down, remember that there's always something out there to smile about. A positive outlook will make people want to be around you more. 3. Crack a joke. Having a sense of humor is important, but don't get too carried away, there are some things you have to be serious about.If you joke about your friend in a rude way it could damage your relationship with them. 4. Smile as much as you can. Signs of encouragement let people know you care about what they are saying. 5. Share interesting/silly ideas. Your thoughts can open up many doors that can lead to friendship. 6. Listen more than you talk. Instead of nodding and smiling and occasionally wiping the drool off your face, try to take what the person says and run with it. Add your own thoughts into the mix - but don't hijack the conversation. 7. Start by doing little things if you are very reserved. For example, every time you go to school, work, or wherever, say hello to one person and have a one-on-one conversation with them. 8. Say ""hello"" to those that don't talk much. Share something about yourself, such as where you're going or why you're there. Avoid talking about the weather - as Tom Waits says, ""Strangers talk about the weather."" Try to compliment them. 9. Don't expect perfection out of anyone, especially yourself. For example, if you forget your own name while introducing yourself, just make fun of the situation. 10. Be Patient. If you are still among strangers, the apprehension of a conversation may cause a delay in comments. Don't worry, that will go away in short order. 11. Talk to older people, maybe even your own folks. They will be less likely to ridicule you, therefore making it easier to learn to talk well. 12. Place importance on making social contacts. The people who are considered popular may not be the sharpest tacks in the box, but they are acquainting with important people who may contribute to their future careers. It is never too late to feel that being popular is important. If your work environment allows for it, host a party, organize a sports game, etc. 13. Love yourself. It is difficult to like others when you do not appreciate yourself for who you are. Try exercise to improve your self-esteem. Start your journey to ""self-discovery."" 14. Be loyal. Little things count. If you make an appointment, be on time. If you're in a group, show up early, and stay late (even if you don't have anything to say at the moment). 15. Be nice to others. Always give compliments, but don't try too hard. If you are shy, take a deep breath and risk it - you never know what might happen. Also, crack a joke every once in a while. Again, if you are shy on the outside but a little crazy on the inside, let it out once in a while. Wear your hair up high and spin around or dance. Others will laugh and find you fun and funny to be with. 16. Stand up for your rights. When someone is being too hard on you or perhaps showing signs of prejudice, speak up! Let it out in the open: ""Is there any reason to make you prejudiced?"" 17. Be honest. Lying will make people not want to be your friend any more. 18."	.

Find a safe and secure location. These locations could be rooftops (that are one story), gardens, fences and your garden. It would be best to practice privately and with safety mats, but this is completely optional. 2. Get some safe shoes on such as high-grip running shoes/sneakers (not Converse or Vans - these are skating shoes and restrict your running ability). Wear whatever is comfortable for you but remember not to wear the clothes which thwart your running or jumping, as these are the necessary requirements for doing parkour. 3. Get onto the first location and practice running and jumping simply. This is the first step in many classes as it will teach you the importance of ""good balance"". Learn the basic moves, like the shoulder roll and the safety/step vault (which is the most basic vault in Parkour) before other vaults. 4. Learn the basics of running. * While doing parkour try to always run on the balls of your feet. * The most important thing while doing any jump in parkour is landing it: try to always land on the balls of your feet and fold your legs afterwards, as it lets your body work as a spring and prevents injury. 5. Now, as you can safely jump and run fast, try learning some ""basic vaults"" which include the shoulder roll and safety roll. * Doing a vault is the best option while clearing any obstacle as doing this lets you maintain your regular speed and allows you to clear the obstacle much faster. * Doing a safety roll prevents any potential injury caused by a jump, as it maintains your body's kinetic energy using it to roll. 6. When you can safely jump from point A to B and know some vaults and rolls, learn more complex maneuvers such as back flips and aerial cartwheels. 7."	.

Locate the downloaded ZIPs, extract them and rename them to ""dp"" and ""server"" in order to access them more easily. 3. Upload ""dp"" and ""server"" to the remote server. If you do not know how to upload the files, read Filezilla's Uploading Manual. Other FTP clients work in the same fashion; consult your client's manual for further information. 4.

When both MySQL and phpMyAdmin are installed (don't forget JRE and JDK!), you can manage your SQL database through phpMyAdmin. Log in and create 2 databases named l2jdb and l2jcb. 6. Copy all files located on ~/dp/gameserver/data to ~/server/gameserver/data. ""~"" indicates your home path, which you can access by typing cd. If you use an FTP client, upload all files located in /dp/gameserver/data in your local machine to /server/gameserver/data in the remote machine (the server that will host your l2j server). 7. Your host provides you with a terminal, in which you can type various commands. Type the following commands, following the order shown below: * cd * cd dp/tools * chmod +x database_installer.sh * ./database_installer.sh 8. Follow the instructions on your screen to add all the tables that are necessary for your server to the SQL database. 9. Once the tables have been added, type the following commands: * cd * cd server/login * chmod +x startLoginServer.sh * chmod +x LoginServer_loop.sh * sudo nano LoginServer_loop.sh * (sudo grants root privileges to the user typing it and nano opens a text file for editing. While sudo is not always necessary, it is there to ensure that you can actually save the file once you're done with your edits) 10.

Determine where you spend your money. If you don’t know where your money is going, you are most likely spending too much. You can get a solid idea in as little as one month and as you continue, you’ll see patterns develop that you can address. Write down everything you buy down to the last dollar. Don’t stop at the obvious things like rent, utilities, gasoline and food – include the ancillary items like sodas and snacks as well as gum or tobacco. Use a Row-by-Column ledger, spreadsheet or other software to keep track every month. If you exclusively use a debit card for your purchases, the bank will do this for you. 2. Immediately eliminate unnecessary routine purchases. While it’s likely this won’t be the largest savings area, it’s important and easy. Is the coffee shop on your way to work really necessary? How critical are the three sodas or snacks a day you buy from the office vending machine at $1.50 each? A cup of coffee that you made at home is only 25-35 cents, as is a soda you bought in a store as part of a 12 pack. Do you seriously have to rent all those movies (and pay those late fees) each month? Have you checked to see whether your library has movies, or calculated the cost of switching to Netflix and BlockBuster Online? Those ten lottery tickets… the odds against you are astronomical. This is quick and most of it is habit. There will be some psychological pain at first but when you add up the dollars you’ll see a big difference instantly. * Make a shopping list before you go to the store and stick to it. This is especially helpful to impulse buyers. Did you ever go in for a carton of eggs and come out with a basket of 15 items? Did you really need 2 for 1 bags of marshmallows or the jumbo box of cereal just because it was on sale? No. You probably didn't need half of those extra things but ended up buying them anyway. A shopping list gives you a clear idea of what you truly need and eliminates unnecessary purchases. 3. Address your utilities. * Heating and cooling (gas or electric): When you leave the house, set your thermostat to an ""away"" setting (a note of caution here: don’t set it so far from comfortable that it takes an inordinate amount of time to return to comfort when you get home: 65°F or 18°C in the winter and 80°F or 27°C in the summer might be reasonable numbers to use). A programmable thermostat will do this for you automatically. (Set it to adjust the thermostat a while before the heating or cooling is needed, such as in the pre-dawn hours to wake to comfortable temperatures and in the mid-afternoon to arrive home to them, and to provide less heating or cooling immediately when it will not be needed.) Consider investing in ceiling fans – you can get these for as little as US$20 and they dramatically reduce cost of heating and cooling by circulating the air more efficiently. If your expenses are already low, and you won't be staying where you are for long, you may not save enough to pay for the fan, however. Also consider electric blankets and mattress pads. * Electric: Lighting is expensive. When you leave a room, turn off the light. The idea that it takes more energy to turn on a light than to keep it on is completely false, as turning on a light only burns as much electricity as burning it for fractions of a second. Energy efficient bulbs really work. This is an investment that will pay off over time but there is a significant savings to be gained. (this energy calculator can help). Turn off your computer/laptop when you’re not using it – (probably) the only reason you leave it on is convenience. Any voltage adapters (including the ones in stereo components) still use electricity even if they're not charging or plugged in to the device. Of the total energy used to run home electronics, 40% is consumed when the appliances are turned off. Either pull the plug on the devices when not in use or buy a device to do it for you, such as a Smart Power Strip ($31 to $44, at http://www.smarthomeusa.com www.smarthomeusa.com]If you have a digital box with an auxiliary AC outlet, plug your TV into it, and program the box to shut off the outlet when the box is turned off. For stereo components, plug them all into a power bar that can easily be switched off when not in use.Open the drapes during the day for light instead of burning electricity. Only use electricity when you absolutely need it.Clean the radiator on the back of your refrigerator, if it is dirty, this will improve the efficiency of one of the larger consumers of energy in your household. * Water: Save water, save money. Invest in a shower-reduction kit – they cost nearly nothing and will start saving you money immediately. They work by reducing the flow to the shower head and the change is barely noticeable. Learn to take quicker showers – an inexpensive egg timer is a good way to help. Repair leaky toilets and faucets – this is an enormous waste of water and easy to fix. Reduce your lawn watering to minimum needs. If you have a pool, keep it covered when it’s not in use to reduce evaporation – also, if it’s heated that will dramatically increase evaporation as well (only heat your pool to keep it from freezing, and invest in a thermal blanket). Also if you're not using the faucet turn it off -- e.g., when brushing teeth do not leave faucet running. Do not buy bottled water except in rare and unusual circumstances; excess chlorine can be removed from tap water by letting it stand in a pitcher in the refrigerator for a few hours, and the fluoride in tap water makes teeth stronger, reducing dental problems and bills. * Gas and Miscellaneous: Do laundry as often as necessary but as little as possible – for a lot of people this is a pleasant step. Reduce the temperature of your shower by a couple of degrees; the less work your water heater does the more money you’ll save. Also keep your water heater thermostat as low as practical; 120 degrees Fahrenheit is often recommended to minimize power consumption and risk of burns. (Turn off the house power before opening any panel to adjust it.) Use the microwave instead of the oven whenever possible – the cost just to preheat an oven is more than the cost to cook a meal in the microwave. Open the windows when it’s nice outside to reduce heating (and cooling) costs.If you live where natural gas is used only in the winter months, arrange with your local utility to do a seasonal shutoff so that you are not saddled with fixed monthly service charges for the ""privilege"" of being connected to the gas service even though you are not using it. With one supplier, it is $17/month. In the 8 months that you don't need the service, you're charged $17 X 8 = $136, but the season shutoff and turn on costs $54. * Cable and Telephone: Seriously, do you really, really need a thousand channels and every single premium channel available including the high definition packages? You can save the full $100+ on your cable bill every month by watching TV for free online, and save most of it while avoiding time-wasting and unnecessary-purchase-inducing commercials by renting DVDs instead, for instance through the vending machines Redbox or through the mail-order company Netflix. However, if you have cable internet, it may actually be CHEAPER to keep basic cable than to pay for internet alone. If you want to save money take a close look at your priorities. For your telephone, shop around based on your use. If you make a lot of long-distance calls to family and friends, perhaps one of the unlimited plans would save money. If all your calls are local you probably can get by with a bare-bones option. Consider that your cell phone may have free long distance; therefore, removing the necessity of having long distance on a land line. Look into the Voice-Over-IP (phone over the internet) for your telephone solutions. Some services, such as Skype, gChat (from Google), and Windows Live! allow you to make free video calls to other users as well as make low cost calls to cell phones and land lines from your computer - including international calls. Other VoIP services, such as Vonage, are not an option for people with DSL, which is tied to their land line. * Cell phone: ""wat r u up 2"" ""nm gtg ttyl"" Text messages cost money. ""Oh no, I have unlimited text!"" Oh? How much does that option cost you? Do you actually even need a cell phone? Does everyone in your family actually need a cell phone? Parents – lay down the law on cell phone usage – is your eleven-year-old sitting around the house texting… are you? Another thing to consider is if you really require a cell phone then do you really need a land line at home? Consider consolidating. If your cell phone use is occasional only, consider a pay-as-you-go plan. Do consider, however, that a cheap unlimited data and navigation plan can sometimes save a lot of money by allowing instant price comparisons and quality checks (which are more relevant for someone with quite a bit of money trying to spend somewhat less than someone wanting to just buy simple necessities). * Cell Phone Saving Plans: Some mobile phone plans are genuinely good and money-saving; but make sure that you shop around first for the deal that best suits you. Many companies offer either contract or PAYG plans based on the cellphone habits of the user, for example, someone who texts an awful lot or someone who prefers to call. For example, some companies reward you for topping up for a little bit per month with hundreds of free texts which can prove very handy and are much cheaper than calls. Remember, calls to networks other than yours, and landlines, are often considerably more pricey. Avoid ""traps"" in cell phone plans such as inordinate per-kilobyte or per-message rates, often over some threshold. Look for a plan with modest, if any, overage charges. For instance Sprint smartphone data is unlimited. 4. Reconsider Gasoline and Miscellaneous Auto: When gas was rationed during World War II, a popular slogan was ""Is this trip really necessary?"" Ask yourself that every time you get in your car. Make a list before you go to the store so you don’t have to make additional trips. Don’t go for a drive for pleasure – walk instead or choose other forms of entertainment (reading,exercising for example). Check the pressure in your tires. Convertibles get better mileage with the top up (although the marginal pleasure for the mile or two per gallon sacrificed with the top down is very cheap entertainment, assuming one has already paid the considerable extra money for a convertible). A poorly running engine is a huge waste – even a spark plug change can make a big difference, as can clean oil. Also, the less you drive the less frequently you’ll change tires, oil, require maintenance, etc. That’s a savings-over-time, of course, but it will mount up. Another way to save gas (and money) is to change your driving habits. By simply driving more slowly, and/or less aggressively, you can save significant amounts of money (calculate for yourself at this web site ). Take particular care to avoid driving in heavy traffic, which causes no joy and little efficiency gain over public transportation, and to avoid where parking will be expensive.

Seriously, can you really tell the difference (blindfolded) between a $30 bottle of wine and a $9 bottle of wine? When you do dine out, actually think about the prices on the menu first. Consider a meal share if the restaurant offers that option. Never, ever order delivery of expensive food; you're wastefully enjoying only the food and not the atmosphere when you could cook for yourself far more cheaply. Look for vacation bargains – consider taking the kids camping instead of one of the super expensive amusement parks.
Reduce_Expenses.txt	Begin_Revision	0.924	## Steps	18888	Also , by not having to shop as often , you spend less money by not being in the store every week and risking impulse purchases .	## Steps	18999	In addition , by not having to shop as often , you spend less money by not being in the store every week and risking impulse purchases .	<insert><In><1>|||<replace><Also><1><addition><2>	True	"Steps  1. Determine where you spend your money. If you don’t know where your money is going, you are most likely spending too much. You can get a solid idea in as little as one month and as you continue, you’ll see patterns develop that you can address. Write down everything you buy down to the last dollar. Don’t stop at the obvious things like rent, utilities, gasoline and food – include the ancillary items like sodas and snacks as well as gum or tobacco. Use a Row-by-Column ledger, spreadsheet or other software to keep track every month. If you exclusively use a debit card for your purchases, the bank will do this for you. 2. Immediately eliminate unnecessary routine purchases. While it’s likely this won’t be the largest savings area, it’s important and easy. Is the coffee shop on your way to work really necessary? How critical are the three sodas or snacks a day you buy from the office vending machine at $1.50 each? A cup of coffee that you made at home is only 25-35 cents, as is a soda you bought in a store as part of a 12 pack. Do you seriously have to rent all those movies (and pay those late fees) each month? Have you checked to see whether your library has movies, or calculated the cost of switching to Netflix and BlockBuster Online? Those ten lottery tickets… the odds against you are astronomical. This is quick and most of it is habit. There will be some psychological pain at first but when you add up the dollars you’ll see a big difference instantly. * Make a shopping list before you go to the store and stick to it. This is especially helpful to impulse buyers. Did you ever go in for a carton of eggs and come out with a basket of 15 items? Did you really need 2 for 1 bags of marshmallows or the jumbo box of cereal just because it was on sale? No. You probably didn't need half of those extra things but ended up buying them anyway. A shopping list gives you a clear idea of what you truly need and eliminates unnecessary purchases. 3. Address your utilities. * Heating and cooling (gas or electric): When you leave the house, set your thermostat to an ""away"" setting (a note of caution here: don’t set it so far from comfortable that it takes an inordinate amount of time to return to comfort when you get home: 65°F or 18°C in the winter and 80°F or 27°C in the summer might be reasonable numbers to use). A programmable thermostat will do this for you automatically. (Set it to adjust the thermostat a while before the heating or cooling is needed, such as in the pre-dawn hours to wake to comfortable temperatures and in the mid-afternoon to arrive home to them, and to provide less heating or cooling immediately when it will not be needed.) Consider investing in ceiling fans – you can get these for as little as US$20 and they dramatically reduce cost of heating and cooling by circulating the air more efficiently. If your expenses are already low, and you won't be staying where you are for long, you may not save enough to pay for the fan, however. Also consider electric blankets and mattress pads. * Electric: Lighting is expensive. When you leave a room, turn off the light. The idea that it takes more energy to turn on a light than to keep it on is completely false, as turning on a light only burns as much electricity as burning it for fractions of a second. Energy efficient bulbs really work. This is an investment that will pay off over time but there is a significant savings to be gained. (this energy calculator can help). Turn off your computer/laptop when you’re not using it – (probably) the only reason you leave it on is convenience. Any voltage adapters (including the ones in stereo components) still use electricity even if they're not charging or plugged in to the device. Of the total energy used to run home electronics, 40% is consumed when the appliances are turned off. Either pull the plug on the devices when not in use or buy a device to do it for you, such as a Smart Power Strip ($31 to $44, at http://www.smarthomeusa.com www.smarthomeusa.com]If you have a digital box with an auxiliary AC outlet, plug your TV into it, and program the box to shut off the outlet when the box is turned off. For stereo components, plug them all into a power bar that can easily be switched off when not in use.Open the drapes during the day for light instead of burning electricity. Only use electricity when you absolutely need it.Clean the radiator on the back of your refrigerator, if it is dirty, this will improve the efficiency of one of the larger consumers of energy in your household. * Water: Save water, save money. Invest in a shower-reduction kit – they cost nearly nothing and will start saving you money immediately. They work by reducing the flow to the shower head and the change is barely noticeable. Learn to take quicker showers – an inexpensive egg timer is a good way to help. Repair leaky toilets and faucets – this is an enormous waste of water and easy to fix. Reduce your lawn watering to minimum needs. If you have a pool, keep it covered when it’s not in use to reduce evaporation – also, if it’s heated that will dramatically increase evaporation as well (only heat your pool to keep it from freezing, and invest in a thermal blanket). Also if you're not using the faucet turn it off -- e.g., when brushing teeth do not leave faucet running. Do not buy bottled water except in rare and unusual circumstances; excess chlorine can be removed from tap water by letting it stand in a pitcher in the refrigerator for a few hours, and the fluoride in tap water makes teeth stronger, reducing dental problems and bills. * Gas and Miscellaneous: Do laundry as often as necessary but as little as possible – for a lot of people this is a pleasant step. Reduce the temperature of your shower by a couple of degrees; the less work your water heater does the more money you’ll save. Also keep your water heater thermostat as low as practical; 120 degrees Fahrenheit is often recommended to minimize power consumption and risk of burns. (Turn off the house power before opening any panel to adjust it.) Use the microwave instead of the oven whenever possible – the cost just to preheat an oven is more than the cost to cook a meal in the microwave. Open the windows when it’s nice outside to reduce heating (and cooling) costs.If you live where natural gas is used only in the winter months, arrange with your local utility to do a seasonal shutoff so that you are not saddled with fixed monthly service charges for the ""privilege"" of being connected to the gas service even though you are not using it. With one supplier, it is $17/month. In the 8 months that you don't need the service, you're charged $17 X 8 = $136, but the season shutoff and turn on costs $54. * Cable and Telephone: Seriously, do you really, really need a thousand channels and every single premium channel available including the high definition packages? You can save the full $100+ on your cable bill every month by watching TV for free online, and save most of it while avoiding time-wasting and unnecessary-purchase-inducing commercials by renting DVDs instead, for instance through the vending machines Redbox or through the mail-order company Netflix. However, if you have cable internet, it may actually be CHEAPER to keep basic cable than to pay for internet alone. If you want to save money take a close look at your priorities. For your telephone, shop around based on your use. If you make a lot of long-distance calls to family and friends, perhaps one of the unlimited plans would save money. If all your calls are local you probably can get by with a bare-bones option. Consider that your cell phone may have free long distance; therefore, removing the necessity of having long distance on a land line. Look into the Voice-Over-IP (phone over the internet) for your telephone solutions. Some services, such as Skype, gChat (from Google), and Windows Live! allow you to make free video calls to other users as well as make low cost calls to cell phones and land lines from your computer - including international calls. Other VoIP services, such as Vonage, are not an option for people with DSL, which is tied to their land line. * Cell phone: ""wat r u up 2"" ""nm gtg ttyl"" Text messages cost money. ""Oh no, I have unlimited text!"" Oh? How much does that option cost you? Do you actually even need a cell phone? Does everyone in your family actually need a cell phone? Parents – lay down the law on cell phone usage – is your eleven-year-old sitting around the house texting… are you? Another thing to consider is if you really require a cell phone then do you really need a land line at home? Consider consolidating. If your cell phone use is occasional only, consider a pay-as-you-go plan. Do consider, however, that a cheap unlimited data and navigation plan can sometimes save a lot of money by allowing instant price comparisons and quality checks (which are more relevant for someone with quite a bit of money trying to spend somewhat less than someone wanting to just buy simple necessities). * Cell Phone Saving Plans: Some mobile phone plans are genuinely good and money-saving; but make sure that you shop around first for the deal that best suits you. Many companies offer either contract or PAYG plans based on the cellphone habits of the user, for example, someone who texts an awful lot or someone who prefers to call. For example, some companies reward you for topping up for a little bit per month with hundreds of free texts which can prove very handy and are much cheaper than calls. Remember, calls to networks other than yours, and landlines, are often considerably more pricey. Avoid ""traps"" in cell phone plans such as inordinate per-kilobyte or per-message rates, often over some threshold. Look for a plan with modest, if any, overage charges. For instance Sprint smartphone data is unlimited. 4. Reconsider Gasoline and Miscellaneous Auto: When gas was rationed during World War II, a popular slogan was ""Is this trip really necessary?"" Ask yourself that every time you get in your car. Make a list before you go to the store so you don’t have to make additional trips. Don’t go for a drive for pleasure – walk instead or choose other forms of entertainment (reading,exercising for example). Check the pressure in your tires. Convertibles get better mileage with the top up (although the marginal pleasure for the mile or two per gallon sacrificed with the top down is very cheap entertainment, assuming one has already paid the considerable extra money for a convertible). A poorly running engine is a huge waste – even a spark plug change can make a big difference, as can clean oil. Also, the less you drive the less frequently you’ll change tires, oil, require maintenance, etc. That’s a savings-over-time, of course, but it will mount up. Another way to save gas (and money) is to change your driving habits. By simply driving more slowly, and/or less aggressively, you can save significant amounts of money (calculate for yourself at this web site ). Take particular care to avoid driving in heavy traffic, which causes no joy and little efficiency gain over public transportation, and to avoid where parking will be expensive. Public transportation mapping and schedules online, often provided by transit agencies, can make that a great alternative in cities. 5. Cut Down on Entertainment: It’s astounding how many people complain about money then describe the latest release of a movie along with the cost of theater popcorn. Also, professional sports event, a music concert or tickets to a play can run hundreds of dollars for a couple on a date. Seriously, can you really tell the difference (blindfolded) between a $30 bottle of wine and a $9 bottle of wine? When you do dine out, actually think about the prices on the menu first. Consider a meal share if the restaurant offers that option. Never, ever order delivery of expensive food; you're wastefully enjoying only the food and not the atmosphere when you could cook for yourself far more cheaply. Look for vacation bargains – consider taking the kids camping instead of one of the super expensive amusement parks. * The great majority of people, except for serious athletes, actors and musicians (as the case may be) cannot tell any difference between a great and good performance; even if they can, most will enjoy greatly increased variety and frequency much more. Enjoy local high-school and non-prestigious college sports, community theater and orchestras conveniently, for little money (with typically nice but inexpensive meals in the vicinity), and socialize and contribute to community spirit while you're at it. 6. Make the most of your clothes and other fashion accessories rather than buying more unnecessarily. Rediscover and show off old ones ""lost"" in storage or the back of a closet, and organize your wardrobe (or whatever you keep them in) and habits to prevent ""losing"" them again. 7. Focus on Food: The only real difference between a $1.99 can of corn and a $0.63 can of corn is $1.36--and the satisfaction of knowing you're not overpaying largely to feed a cycle of ads to make yourself and others fret about not paying more. (Sure there are exceptions; people on low-sodium or otherwise restricted diets will often have to pay more). The grocery store is a place you can save big. * Look for foods that are marked ""WIC"" for savings. Those have been approved for the Women, Infants and Children program by the USDA Department of Food and Nutrition Services… healthy, nutritious and inexpensive. That ring of cooked shrimp is on sale and sure looks tasty… how about a nice grilled chicken breast with green beans and rice? Make dining in an experience instead of just a convenience. It’s quite possible to spend as much on home food as you would by eating out if you are wasteful. * Particularly if you eat meat, buy what's on sale. Most supermarkets regularly cycle through a variety of meats for specials; you'll get to try them all just the same. The difference between expensive beef and other beef is generally just extra fat and tenderness compatible with not-thorough cooking in the expensive beef. * Invest $10 in a coffee pot, or $100 in an espresso machine (pump-driven is best, but expensive ones can die just like cheap ones). Making your coffee at home instead of purchasing your $1, $3, or $7 custom latte at the coffee shop will save you money. * Consider taking your lunch to work instead of buying lunch each day. Even an inexpensive lunch out is several dollars a day – do the math. * Use coupons whenever possible. Make sure these are on items you would normally eat so you don't purchase things that will be wasted by sitting in your cupboards forever or spoil in your refrigerator. Also use buy store specials and use store customer cards when possible toward food purchases. Consider, however, that store brands are generally just as good and often cheaper than name brands with coupons. * Look into joining a warehouse club. The price of the membership is usually made up in the first shopping. They carry name-brand products and will take coupons."	Warehouse club shopping must be done with discretion or you will not save money.

Know what you want to buy. Because you will be able to jump from item to item with the greatest of ease, not having a list will lead you down the path of credit card disaster. Consumers can be led astray by pretty graphics and animation, telling them that they MUST purchase this item because they only have three left. Stand strong and stick to your list the entire time. 2. Have a budget. As with any shopping endeavor, know what you can spend before you shop. The best way to determine how much you can afford is to calculate your total monthly expense as compared to your net income. Add in any money you’ve socked away for the holidays to determine how much you can spend. Or, if you’ve always spent a certain amount of money every holiday season and seemed to pay off your bills with ease within a few months, use that total as your guide. Another way you can stick to you budget is transfer money via PayPal to make your purchases. Doing this is virtually like paying with cash--when you are out of dough it’s time to stop shopping. 3. Research merchants and prices. Not only should you do a quick price comparison at least a week before Cyber Monday, you should also know each sites’ shipping policy. Generally speaking, free shipping is the goal. However, avoid getting caught up with the offer of “buy $100 worth of merchandise for free shipping” at sites where you only want one item. This could cause you to purchase items you don’t really want or need. Other research you should do: * Select several of the big-ticket items (such as a T.V., iPods or computers) you want to buy and find prices from three different vendors. Having three prices will give you the best way to compare the Cyber Monday deal and determine if you are really getting a bargain. Plus it will give you an idea of which vendor is offering the best deal. * Identify sites that allow you to purchase numerous items for a good price, along with free shipping. Superstores like WalMart, Target, Costco and Sam’s typically give you more bang for your buck (and most likely free shipping) when it comes to a diverse number of items. * Avoid weird sites. This isn’t the time to test drive a new vendor--this is holiday shopping for goodness sake…we’re talking serious stuff. Stick to the merchants you know so you can trust that your item will arrive on time. * Look for secure sites.	Also, examine the URL. A secure URL starts with https (s for secure) and not http.

Get your first clients. The hardest part of starting your own cleaning service is obtaining those first clients. Most clients want to know how long you have been in business, and because they're trusting you with their stuff, are going to want references. Being new, you won't have any client references, but ask friends and family if you can clean their homes, and then get permission to use them as references. Not only will they be able to give you an honest reference, you'll also pre-thank them by doing a great job on their home. * Let clients know that you are new to the business but that you have thoroughly researched all aspects of the cleaning business * Assure them that you know what you are doing and that you are quite capable of cleaning their home to their specifications. Be confident. This can't be stressed enough. Clients love to see confidence. It relieves their worries and lets them know that their home is in good hands. 2. Go for quality. When cleaning those first homes, go for the very best quality you can give, not how fast you can clean the home. Cleaning efficiently takes a long time, but you will get to the point where you can do a thorough cleaning in a short time. * After cleaning, go back and double check all rooms to make sure you didn't miss anything. Impress those first clients and word of mouth soon spread. 3. Advertise. Advertising your company and your image is very important. Before you start advertising, decide what image you want to portray on your advertising material. For branding purposes (recognition), be consistent with all your advertising. * If you have a logo, use it on all your advertising materials. It is best to have a website developed before you start advertising. Stick with the same logo and colors on both your printed advertising, and on your website. * Advertise in a local paper with a text ad. Try to come up with an eye catching ad. Do not sell your service based on low rates, sell your service based on your quality of work and what you can do for the client that other companies do not. There is a lot of competition in the cleaning service. You have to stand out from the rest. * Having your business name and contact information on your vehicle is a great way to advertise. It's recommended to use vinyl lettering. The lettering looks much more professional than the magnetic signs. * Print flyers. You can print nice flyers on your home computer, invest in some professional flyers. Hang flyers at hair dressers, laundromats, restaurants, bakeries, grocery stores, etc. Put flyers on car windows at local groceries stores and businesses. You can even go door to door in your targeted neighborhoods. * Make door hangers. When people get flyers or ads in their mailbox they usually throw them away with the junk mail. A door hanger may just be the ticket to getting them to look at your ad. Pick the neighborhood you would like to work in and hang the door hangers on the door knobs. 4. Print business cards. Give your business cards to friends and family members, people you meet, on public boards, anywhere you can. You can also ask your local businesses if you can leave some cards on their counters, especially places where cleaning, or just ""clean"" are on people's minds: the dry cleaner's, day care centers (parents want clean homes for their kids!), and other places like that. 5. Get a referral program. A great way to obtain new clients is through a referral program. Offer existing clients a discount when they refer a friend. You can give your existing clients a discount when the friend uses your services three times, for example. 6. Invest in a website. People live very busy lives, so they use the convenience of the internet to shop for the services they need. * A lot of working women will shop for services while at work. Everyone that has a business should have a website. It shows clients that you are serious about your business and allows them research your business in their own time. * Some sites are very affordable and make you and your company look like you have been in business for years and are the clear choice for the job. (ACleanerBusiness.com) * In addition to your website, advertise on Craigslist, and if you can, Angie's List. 7. Use natural cleaning products. By using all natural products, you can offer your clients a healthy cleaning experience and protect ourselves against harsh chemicals. Clients love the natural cleaning products with essential oils. They come home to a healthy clean home filled with the wonderful scents of aromatherapy essential oils. 8. Charge reasonably for your work. You should sell your services based on your quality of work and not your low rates. If your rates are too low, clients will think that your work is sub-standard and that you are not experienced. Also, you want to attract the clients that can afford your services. As the old saying goes ""You get what you pay for."" * Some companies charge by the hour, some charge by the room, some charge a flat rate per home and some charge by the square foot. It is better to charge by the home, not by the hour. If a client knows they have to pay one set fee, they don't care if you take 2 hours or 5 hours. Also your clients will know what they are paying up front and won't have to worry about added expenses. * No two houses are the same. And there is no set charge for all homes. You have to clean for awhile yourself to get some experience and to work out a system to clean efficiently. Only you know what you want and need to make. Decide what you need to make hourly to cover all expenses and still make a good profit. * A word of advise: Make sure when you start your company that you charge what you would charge if you had employees. Some people make the mistake of under charging when they start out just to get customers and then later on when they grow and need to hire help they aren't making enough money on their houses to pay help. 9. Get insurance and bonding. You need to be an honest person and somewhat personable. People will need to trust you to be in their homes. Most clients are concerned about having someone new in their house, with good reason. You should be bonded and fully insured. * Liability insurance rates depend on your insurance carrier and where you are located. Each person you hire will increase your liability insurance. It's well worth the cost. You can pay quarterly or yearly. You can purchase your bond through your local insurance company. You will need to renew the bond every year. * Note: If you hire employees and cover them under your insurance, they must be an employee on payroll and not a sub-contractor. If you employ them as a sub-contractor your insurance will not cover them. If they are a sub-contractor they are required to carry their own insurance. 10. Hire help. If you start out cleaning the homes by yourself, you will eventually get to the point where you need to expand your business. Start out with one part time employee. Train them and let them take your place one day a week. Then have them take your place two days a week and so on. This will give you the free time that you need to market your business and obtain more clients. *"	Eventually you will be able to stop doing the cleaning yourself and just run the business end, which is the only way you will be able to grow your business. When training new employees, always, either train them yourself or have a lead person train them.
Remove_a_Name_from_a_Mortgage_Without_Refinancing.txt	Begin_Revision	0.967	### Getting the Lender to Agree to Remove a Name From a Joint Mortgage	660	As removing a name from a joint mortgage is not a typical request , it is best that you contact your lender in person or by telephone rather than by email .	### Getting the Lender to Agree to Remove a Name From a Joint Mortgage	705	Because removing a name from a joint mortgage is not a typical request , it is best that you contact your lender in person or by telephone rather than by email .	<replace><As><1><Because><1>	True	Getting the Lender to Agree to Remove a Name From a Joint Mortgage  1. Contact your lender.	Since your lender holds the mortgage to the home, the lender wants to be able to hold both borrowers responsible if payments are not made. Therefore, a lender may be reluctant to remove one borrower's name from the loan. While this process, commonly referred to as an assumption or a novation, is not common, some lenders do allow it with respect to certain types of mortgage loans.

Recognize when you are at risk of getting STI/STDs. With any sexual activity, there is always a risk of being infected by an STI. In some circumstances, you are more likely to receive an STI and knowing about these situations can help you and your health care professional decide if you need to get tested. You will probably need to be tested if: * You have had unprotected sex with a new partner. * You or your partner has had unprotected sex with others. * Your partner tells you they have a sexually transmitted disease. * You are pregnant or planning to be pregnant. * Your doctor or nurse notices abnormal vaginal discharge or your cervix is red and inflamed. 2. Test if you have trichomoniasis by collecting cell samples from your vagina. Your doctor or health care provider will ask to collect vaginal cell tissue or discharge from your vagina by using a cotton swab. Sometimes the swab may look like a plastic loop rather than a cotton tip. The tool is wiped over parts of the body that could be infected such as inside your vagina or around it. This is often painless with only a bit of discomfort. * Your doctor might be able to immediately examine the sample under a microscope and let you know your results right away. Or you may have to wait a week to 10 days for your results. During this waiting period, be sure to avoid any sexual activity so you don't spread an infection if you have one. * Blood tests and cervical screening tests don't test for trichomoniasis. Be sure to ask specifically for a trichomoniasis or STI test. 3. Take antibiotics prescribed to you by your doctor.	At times, your doctor might even prescribe medication to you before your tests come in just in case. Your doctor will most likely prescribe you an oral antibiotic called metronidazole (Flagyl) which stops the growth of bacteria and protozoa (trichomoniasis is a protozoan parasite). Side effects include dizziness, headache, diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, constipation, changes in taste, and dry mouth. It can also cause your urine to come out darker in colour.

However, tangible planners may be easier to update, and it’s always satisfying to cross a completed assignment off with an actual writing utensil.

Determine what parts and tools you'll need. If the front brakes are squealing loudly, you'll need pads only. If the car shakes when braking, you'll need to have the rotors resurfaced (called ""turning""), or replace them. If the car pulls to one side while braking, but stays straight otherwise, you may need calipers. 2. Go to the parts store and buy more parts than you think you'll need. You can always return what you don't use, and if you get caught without something while the car is apart, you may not be able to go anywhere to buy anything. 3. Park the car in a clean, well-lit place. Block the rear wheels with something heavy to prevent the car from rolling while it's jacked up. Apply the emergency brake (emergency brakes only use the rear, not the front). Give the car a good couple of shoves from side to side; if it's going to shift on the jackstands or fall off, better now than when you're partially under it with the wheels off. 4. Remove the front hubcaps and loosen the lug nuts before jacking the car up. If you skip this step, loosening the lugs may be very annoying, if not impossible. It is also extremely dangerous to loosen lug nuts after a car has been jacked up. 5. Jack the car up with a floor jack and put it on jackstands. Make sure the jackstands are positioned under a solid part of the car - frame or subframe. Finish removing the wheels. Place the wheels under the car, just to the rear of the jackstands. In case the car slips off the stands, those wheels can prevent you from being caught under a falling car. 6. Make sure you have all the necessary tools. There are two bolts that hold the caliper to the pad bracket, and two bolts that hold the pad bracket to the steering knuckle. If you don't have the tools to remove these, now is the time to put the wheels back on and go to the hardware store. [You may need both SAE and Metric sizes of wrenches and sockets, as well as bleeder screw wrenches. Also, you may need a set of hex key wrenches or a hex bit socket set.] 7. Remove the caliper from the pad bracket. The pads may come out with the caliper, or stay in the bracket, depending on the car. Place the caliper on top of the steering knuckle, or hang it with a piece of clothes hanger wire or any other place where it won't be hanging from the brake hose. 8. Remove the pads and inspect them for wear. You may need to employ the large flat screwdriver to get the pads out. If either is down to the metal backing, you'll need to cut or replace the rotors. This is also a good time to compare the wear pattern of the left side brakes to the right side. If there is a vast difference, you'll need to replace the calipers. 9. Apply antisqueal paste to the backing of the new brake pads, but do not install them yet. 10. Inspect the brake rotors. If there are any grooves, or excessive glazing, remove them for resurfacing (called ""turning"") or replacement. Inspect the brake hoses. If they are leaking by the fittings or damaged, they'll need replacing - but that is outside the scope of this article. If you are only installing brake pads, skip to step 20. 11. Remove brake rotors. Unbolt the pad bracket from the steering knuckle. The bolts that hold this on tend to get frozen, so you may need to employ a hammer, breaker bar, Liquid Wrench or a torch to loosen them. 12. On most cars, the rotor is separate from the hub. Simply slide the rotor off of the studs. You may need to remove a set screw and/or use a rubber mallet to loosen the rotor. You may need an impact driver to remove a set screw. If the brake rotor and hub are one piece, remove the cotter pin and castle nut from the axle to allow removal. 13. To get the rotors resurfaced (""turned""), take them to a machine shop/auto parts store that turns rotors. Some auto parts stores have brake lathes or a machine shop. Call before starting your job to verify hours; most machine shops are only open until noon on Saturday and are closed on Sunday. Rotor/hub assemblies can be resurfaced (""turned""), but I would recommend just replacing them. Even though the replacement parts are expensive, you're replacing the hub and its bearings instead of putting the old hub and bearings back on the car. However, not all new rotor/hub assemblies include the bearings [although they usually install new races, so you can just ""drop in"" the new grease-packed bearings]. You may have to install them yourself, as well as pack them with grease. So a set of bearings may be a necessary purchase as well. [When applicable, this is also a good time to repack your front wheel bearings. Refer to your service manual or lubrication guide for this procedure. You'll need some new cotter pins and wheel bearing grease for this, as well as a pair of needle-nose pliers.] 14. Install the new or resurfaced (""turned"") rotors the same way they came off. New rotors have a layer of oil on them to prevent rust while they're on the shelf. Clean this off with carb cleaner; it works better than brake cleaner in this case. Reattach the pad bracket. If you are not replacing calipers, skip to step 20. 15. Replacing calipers. Make sure the brake fluid reservoir is securely closed. Remove the bolt holding the brake hose to the caliper. This is a special hollow bolt that allows fluid to flow through it; don't lose it. 16. Drain the fluid from the caliper into a safe container for proper disposal. 17. The new caliper will come with two brass washers, rubber grommets for the slide pins, pad retaining clips (if applicable), possibly new slide pins, and maybe that hollow bolt mentioned above. Make sure that the calipers are installed with the bleeder fittings/screws in the upper or top position. If you accidentally switch the left and right calipers and install them on the wrong side (easier to do than you think!), the bleeder fittings will be in a lower position, which will result in trapped air inside the caliper fluid chamber, which will make bleeding the brakes impossible to do. Remember, bleeder screws UP! 18. If you need to reuse the old slide pins, clean them with a wire wheel or brush. 19. Reattach the brake hose by putting a new brass or copper washer on each side of the hose fitting, and the hollow bolt through. Reuse of the old washers, or failure to put the new ones in the right place will cause the brakes to leak. Tighten the bolt firmly. 20. If you haven't done so yet, clean the caliper slide pins, and any place where the pads slide against the caliper or pad bracket with a wire brush. Apply brake lubricant to all of those locations. 21. Compress the caliper piston, if necessary. Take one of the old brake pads and place it in the caliper against the piston. Using the large C-clamp (usually an 8"" to 10"" size {inner measurement} will do), slowly and evenly compress the piston back into the caliper. An even easier way to compress this piston is use a special (but inexpensive and readily available) Lisle Corp Brake Pad Spreader tool (Lisle part 24400 $7.95) made specifically for this--it beats hauling a heavy 10"" iron C-clamp around--plus it's much faster to use! Some brake fluid may come out of the reservoir at this point; watch out for drips if you're on the driver's side. Be careful, brake fluid will remove the paint from your vehicle! 22. Put the new pads in the caliper or bracket. You may need to employ the large flat screwdriver again, but this time be more careful so you don't destroy any of the pad clips. 23. Place the caliper back into the pad bracket, and bolt it in. If you have not replaced the calipers, skip to step 27. 24. Bleed the brakes. You'll need two people for this, and do one side at a time. Put the wheels back on the car to hold the rotor on straight, but do not let the car down from the jackstands yet. 25. Remove the rubber cover from the bleeder screw, and unscrew it about 1/4 turn, or just enough to loosen it. Attach an appropriate size clear or rubber hose to the bleeder screw with the other end immersed in brake fluid in a jar or can. This helps to avoid sucking air back into the bleeder screw. 26. Have your assistant slowly depress the brake pedal until it's at the floor. While the pedal is at the floor, close the bleeder screw. Have your assistant slowly lift the pedal."	Repeat this process until you see brake fluid (without bubbles) coming out of the bleeder. Some brakes are gravity-bleed, and only require you to open the bleeder screw until you see the fluid, without working the brake pedal, but this procedure works in all cases. Make sure the brake fluid reservoir does not run empty, else you'll be introducing air into the brake system again and will have to bleed it all out.

Wash your hands. First things first, you need to keep the wound sterile and prevent infection. Wash your hands with soap and water or a disinfecting solution if you can. * With soap, make sure to work up a good lather and scrub for at least 20 seconds. Rinse with warm water. * Wash the area around the wound, too, if you can. 2. Apply downward pressure. The “retrograde” technique is the easiest but least successful way to remove a fish hook. It works best with un-barbed or superficially embedded simple hooks, i.e. with a single barb at the end. Normally you won’t need an anesthetic. * With one hand, apply downward force to the shank of the hook, i.e. the mid-point of the curve. This should disengage the hook’s barb so you can draw it backwards through the skin. * The force should be gentle. Your aim is to rotate the hook back only slightly. 3. Pull the hook back. Once the barb is disengaged, slowly try to pull the hook backward through the skin along the path of entry. Ideally, it should slip out. * Do not continue to pull if you feel resistance. Stop and consider another method. * Pulling against resistance can tear or otherwise damage the skin and tissue. 4. Treat the wound.	Usually, it is enough to leave the wound open and dress it.

Get the necessary tools. There are a number of possible tools which you can use to remove the grout. Which will partially depend on how much money you wish to spend, how much and which type of grout you need to remove, and how often you intend to remove grout. * You can use power tools. There are a variety of tools, called grout removal tools or regrout tools, which will help you remove grout quickly and with much less effort. These are helpful if you have a large amount of grout to remove or remove grout often. * You can use manual tools as well. If you for some reason cannot use power tools but find that you have a reasonable amount of grout to remove, use a manual grout removal tool. This will look like a small trowel. * If you only have a small amount of grout to remove or it is something soft like rubber grout, you can use a standard razor blade, like an exacto knife. 2. Cover the surfaces of the appliances you are planning on keeping.	Drape the appliances with a large blanket or drop cloth, making sure you do not leave any part of them exposed. If necessary, use tape to secure the edges of the blankets closed. If you are planning on keeping the tiles and removing just the grout, cover the edges of each tile with painter's tape.

Speak_Effectively.txt	Begin_Revision	0.951	### Being a Good Speaker	1109	"""""""Besides , try not to add fillers or the """""""" uhms , hmm , ahh , like """""""" when you converse ."""""""	### Being a Good Speaker	1212	"""""""Also , try not to add fillers or the """""""" uhms , hmm , ahh , like """""""" when you converse ."""""""	<replace><Besides><1><Also><1>	True	Being a Good Speaker  1. Be a good listener! A good speaker is a good listener. And a good listener listens to good speakers. This means, you should observe how good speakers (they can be public speakers, ministers, pastors, priests, actors/actresses, teachers, reporters, politicians, etc) speak. How do they pronounce each words clearly? How do they use variations of tones while speaking? What's their accent (American, British, Posh, standard English)? Have your models and get ideas from the way they speak. Besides, good listeners don't only listen to experts, they also listen to normal people. If you listen to others and give them chance to speak, you will gain respect and in return, they will listen to you as well. 2. Project confidence. Your confidence is reflected on how you speak. An effective speaker is confident. Don't lose your listeners' interest and trust when you speak. Overcome social anxieties in speaking in front of people, if you have it. Project a strong voice showing that you can speak effectively and you know what you say. 3. Widen your vocabulary. A person who knows and uses many words will sound smart! It will be easier for a person to convert his ideas to spoken words if he/she can pick the right, appropriate words from his/her mind. You can convey what you really want to say without much effort. In addition, your talk will sound interesting and not dull if you use different words. It's like a colorful picture not just a black and white photograph. As you use different words, your listener can easily picture out in their mind what you're talking about. And you can avoid redundancies with words * But, don't use complex highfalutin words often. Most people will not understand you. Use them minimally. 4. Get a thesaurus and a dictionary. These books will help you absorb new words for a richer vocabulary, and will help you to know synonyms and antonyms for words. The dictionary can help you know the proper pronunciations of words - especially those words you're not sure how to enunciate. Do not, however, always read and memorize words from dictionaries. Candidly, you will just forget them! The proper way of remembering new words is just by knowing its spelling, pronunciation, meaning and by using it whenever and wherever you can. Apply those words to daily matters or conversations. 5. Practice in front of mirror. By practicing speaking in front of mirror, you can see how you speak. You can see if you do unnecessary things when speaking, and so you can rectify it. This is also important to see if you do nice articulation. When practicing articulation, face the mirror. Take note, professional speakers rehearse in front of mirror. 6. Maintain eye contact. This is a sign that you are paying attention to your listener, that you are really conversing with them. You make a magnetic power through eye contact with your listener. Besides, you can get your listener's attention. You can make an instant camaraderie and a warm treatment. However, don't just stare at your listener's eye the whole time you speak. It's normal to look to your left, right, up, down, when we are thinking of what to say. You may look away from your listener, but after you pick from your mind what to say maintain eye contact again. * If you are not comfortable of maintaining eye contact: * Try to practice speaking in front of mirror and look to your eyes. * Try to look at your listener's nose if you are a meter away. Your listener won't notice that you're actually looking at their nose. 7. Omit some informality. Speak professionally. It doesn't mean you're not going to talk the normal way with your family and friends. You will still talk normally but should sound professional and with image. Avoid using slang and unnecessary expressions. Most people think that doing such expressions will make them sound like Americans. But, they will just look like classless and somewhat uneducated. You don't want to be like that.	To do that, think before you speak. Speak with a moderate speed so you'll not cram of ideas you want to say.

Plan how many days you're going to run. When you're planning on restarting your running regimen after a break, its a good idea to plan out your schedule. This can help make sure you slowly reintroduce your runs without overdoing it. * Sit down and write out your schedule for a week at a time. Look through it and see when you could set aside some time to fit in a few runs during the week. * You might want to consider picking days where you can spend more time on your runs (like fitting in a warm-up, cool down and stretching routine) instead of squeezing it in before work. * You might want to consider using a training plan or schedule as well. You can find these from running coaches, athletic/personal trainers or from running resources like magazines or books. * A training schedule will give you several weeks of runs at one time in addition to telling you how long to run, how often to run and what cross training exercises you should be doing as well. 2. Go for a trial run. Another important thing to do when restarting your runs, is to go on a trial run. See how it goes and how you feel. This will determine what you can and cannot start doing. * After you've set up a week or two of your running schedule, head out on your first run. This should be your trial run. * During this run, really pay extra attention to how you're feeling. How's your pace? Your do your legs feel? How is your breathing and heart rate? * If your run goes OK, that's great. You can continue with your training schedule. This doesn't mean you should advance to a faster pace or longer mileage. * However, if this run feels overly difficult or if you're overly sore afterwards, you may need to cut back on the total mileage or slow down your pace. You may have overestimated how well you would do. Cut back a little and give yourself more time to get back into the swing of things. 3. Take it slow. Regardless of long you're planning on running or what pace you're going to aim for, you should always start slow. It's better to be safe with a slower, shorter run, than come up with an injury after your first run back. * If you've just been released to restart running or you've found your motivation to hit the pavement, its important to harness that excitement a bit. Jumping right back into wherever you left off could cause an injury or a lot of muscle soreness. * Start with just a few days a week. Also choose a shorter distance and run slower than normal. If this ends up being too easy, that's OK. You can also increase the time or length on your next run. * In general, most fitness professionals (especially running coaches) will recommend that you only increase your run length by about 1 mile per week. So even if that first run is easy, don't increase by more than 1 mile in total. 4. Plan rest days in between runs. The first 6-8 weeks of your new running program are key. Although you may want to run everyday or run several days in a row, this isn't recommended. * In general, most fitness professionals will advise you to plan to have a rest day in between days that you're running. * Rest allows your body to recover and your muscles to regenerate. This, in the long-term, will support better performance and progress. * You don't have to avoid all activity on your rest days. You can do lighter, lower impact activity like using the elliptical, swimming or cycling. 5. Stay positive and be patient. Going slow, taking your time and scheduling in adequate rest is essential.	.
Run_a_Fast_Mile.txt	Begin_Revision	0.955	## Steps	885	However , it is important to make a conscious effort to keep pace on this lap , or else you will fall behind .	## Steps	942	Nonetheless , it is important to make a conscious effort to keep pace on this lap , or else you will fall behind .	<replace><However><1><Nonetheless><1>	True	Steps  1. Get a running buddy. It is highly recommended this be carried out with someone who runs about the same speed as yourself if possible. Training alone is not discouraged but training with a team of similar runners is a huge motivation booster. 2. Set your mind to it. Whether your goal is 4 minutes, 5 minutes, 6 minutes or even more, it can't kept be stressed that one needs a lot of motivation to break a personal record. The mind has a habit of emulating your thoughts. If you believe something won't happen, your actions will make so that it doesn't happen. 3. Stretch, before and after practice and meets. Always do a 5-10 minute warm up and cool down. These will help keep you from injury. 4. Learn how to run properly. Posture is crucial and sometimes is what prevents many people from running faster. 5. Start with distance running and stick with this for about 4 weeks so your body gets used to long runs. Keep the pace consistent. Right now you're focusing on increasing your mileage. For the first week, do thirty minute runs each day (20 if you're out of shape). The second week, increase this to 40 minutes, then to 50 minutes the next, then 50 - 60 minutes the fourth. But remember that there are many different techniques you can use, so read up on how to run longer. 6. Take Sundays off except for some stretching or cross training. 7. Incorporate speed work in the fifth week. These are known as tempo runs and should be done once or twice a week. They should be at least two days apart from each other to allow for recovery. Tempo has three parts: Practice pace, race pace, and practice. Say you're doing a 30 minute run. You would run 10 minutes normal pace, run race pace for 10 minutes, then slow it back down for the remaining 10 minutes. For simplification, race pace is any pace above your normal pace. 8. Do tempo runs for about 2-3 weeks while continuing with your distance runs on the other days. Distance runs should now be about 40-45 minutes. By the 7th or 8th week, you should be comfortable with running. 9. Stop your tempo runs at around the 8th or 9th week. The aim here is to do intervals of 2000m, 1000m, 400m, 300m. The exact number isn't necessary. The more the distance, the less the repetitions. So on one day after a 20-30 minute run, proceed to do 4 reptitions 2000m with rest in between around 3 minutes. By your last repetition, you should feel like quitting, that's how tired you should be. Always a have a recovery distance run in between the days of your sprints/speed workout. Recovery runs are very light and relaxed runs that last about 30mins or less. On another day you could do a 6 x 1000m or 10 x 400 or 12 x 300. The repetitions are chosen arbitrarily. You can even mix then up on the same day such that you do a pyramid. 2000m, rest, 1000m, rest, 400m, rest 300m, rest 400m, rest, 1000m, rest, 2000m. Speed workouts should last 2 weeks. 10. And now... the moment you've been waiting for... time to run your mile. Here's some lap-by-lap strategy: * Pre-race: Warm up. Do a few paced sprints to get your heart rate up. Mentally go through the race in your head. Know what times you want to have at each lap. * Lap 1: You'll want to start out a little faster than what is necessary to get your target time. The fact of the matter is that psychologically, you're going to slow down as you get further into the mile, so make sure this one is good to compensate. Keep in mind, though, you don't want to spend it all on this lap. A good example would be, if you want to run a 5:00 mile, each lap would need to be 75 seconds. A good time for your first lap would be 71-73; not too fast, but fast enough to give you some slack. * Lap 2: Fall into pace. This is where those 400 meter intervals you worked on will come in handy; know what it feels like to run the pace you need to run. This is the lap which should be right on target. In the 5:00 minute mile we mentioned earlier, THIS is the lap which should be exactly 75 seconds, so your time at the halfway point should be 2:26-2:28. Your adrenaline rush will probably start to wear off midway through this one, and you'll start feeling it, but focus on your running form and keeping the pace. * Lap 3: Mentally and physically, this is the toughest lap for most people. More often than not, this is the one which will determine if you get your target time or not. Chances are, you will slow down from your original pace. In our 5:00 mile example, most people will run from about 77-78 seconds. However, since the first lap was hopefully strong, this puts us almost perfectly at 3:45, which is exactly on target.	Remember, your next lap is the last one!

Open a web browser and log on to a search engine. Unless you already know the exact website you want to use, a search engine is the best place to start your search. Depending on your personal preferences—and what’s already been downloaded on the computer you’re using—you could use a browser like Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Chrome. * Major search engines include Google, Yahoo, and Bing. 2. Search for “coloring pages for kids” for broad results. This search will provide you with various options to choose the desired coloring page for your child. Try opening up 4 or 5 of the top sites and see which your child is most interested in. * This is also a good route to take if you’re planning to print of multiple coloring pages for several children. Different kids may be interested in coloring different types of images. 3. Look for “coloring pages with animals” if your child likes animals. Kids often enjoy coloring pictures of animals. They can either recreate the colors and patterns of animals they’ve seen at a zoo, or they can imaginatively think up new shades and patterns to color the animals. Many websites will feature animals in their coloring pages. * For example, the Just Color site has plenty of animal coloring pages at: https://www.justcolor.net/kids/. 4. Try a search for “fantasy coloring pages” if your kid enjoys fantasy. If your child likes knights, dragons, and castles, they’ll probably enjoy coloring in images of fantasy creatures. Sites that feature fantasy coloring pages will also often feature images of mythological characters or some more realistic historical buildings and settings. * For example, the Coloring.ws website features a large number of free fantasy coloring pages. View them at: http://www.coloring.ws/fantasy.htm. 5. Type in “seasonal coloring pages” to find pictures of nature. This would be a great coloring activity for children during months of seasonal change. You could point out that they can just look out the window to get ideas for how they can color in the image. A search for “seasonal coloring pages” will also bring up pages related to holidays, which your child may also enjoy coloring. * The Crayola website features a number of free seasonal coloring pages. Find out more at: http://www.crayola.com/free-coloring-pages/seasons/. * Fisher-Price also has a large online selection of free seasonal coloring pages. See them at: http://play.fisher-price.com/en_US/GamesandActivities/ColoringPages/index.html. 6. Check out TV network sites to find coloring images of characters. If your child wants to color images of some of their favorite animated characters, visit the sites of the networks that broadcast the shows. Many child-oriented programs have websites that provide coloring images of popular characters. *	Find out more at: http://www.pbs.org/parents/fun-and-games/printables-and-coloring-pages/.

Read “Set up a Fundraising Event.” 2. Determine your menu. A fairly simple and popular menu is spaghetti, salad, garlic bread, and drinks. 3. Consider including a table of donated desserts that are “sold” for donations of any amount. This has several advantages. It raises more money for your event; it allows people who can’t be at the event to volunteer by baking things ahead of time; it is simple to run and will probably get more donated money than a regular bake sale. 4. Decide if other events will be run with the dinner, such as fundraising games or a silent auction. Google “fundraising games” or specific games, such as “50-50” to get ideas for these.) Determine if entertainment will be part of the evening. 5. Make a list of eating utensil supplies. Guess how many people you think will show up and buy more than that. Buy from a store with a generous return policy. If you don’t want to use disposable supplies, make sure you have adequate dishwashing facilities and volunteers. If you go with disposable, make sure you have adequate garbage bags, cans, and facilities. 6. Make a list of food needed. Make sure you have adequate refrigerator space for anything that needs to be kept cool. 7. Brainstorm about other needed supplies, such as paper towels, and make a list. Go through the whole event in your mind and consider supplies and items for things such as cooking, serving, and cleaning up. 8. Find a store near your event that will be open during the event for emergency supply runs. If the store requires a membership, make sure you have a member available to make runs to that store during the event. 9. Recruit and organize volunteers. If possible designate people in charge of each crew (set up, kitchen, pay table, serving tables, cleanup). If possible, have those crew leaders determine responsibilities for each volunteer. Volunteers need (and want) clear, simple instructions on what to do. 10. Make a list of volunteer jobs with descriptions (if needed) and a place to note the people who have signed up for each job. People often volunteer at the last moment. A list makes it easier to tell them where and how they can help. Don’t worry too much if your cleanup crew seems to lack enough volunteers. There will be people hanging around at the end of your event. Just announce that helpers are needed to clean up and direct them to the person in charge of the cleanup. 11. Solicit donated desserts a few days in advance, if you plan to have a “bake sale.” Have your bakers put portion-sized desserts on disposable plates covered with plastic wrap. Have disposable plates and plastic wrap available for people who forget to do that. 12. Figure out what you plan to do with leftover food from the event. Prepared or opened things can’t be returned. Refrigerated items probably also can’t be returned or might be accepted and then tossed. (The store can’t assume the items were refrigerated properly.) Options for leftover food include giving it to volunteers, leaving it for the next fundraiser (if appropriate), or donating it to a food bank, local shelter, or soup kitchen. In any case, you’ll need containers for storing prepared food. If nothing else is available, consider getting some large heavy duty baggies for this. (You may need boxes or something similar to carry several of these.) 13. On the day of the event, start getting ready at least two to three hours before. You’ll need the time not only for setting up but also to allow for any mistakes. 14. Designate someone who is willing to go to the store to buy forgotten items. If you are buying things at a warehouse store that requires a membership, make sure that person has a membership.	After they have left for a supplies run, you’ll surely find something else that needs to be picked up.

And make sure that person has a cell phone and that a key person at the event has that number. After they have left for a supplies run, you’ll surely find something else that needs to be picked up. 15. If you’re making pasta, you should start heating the water early. It takes a long time to get a huge pot of water to the boiling point. One option is to make some noodles early, toss them with olive oil to keep them separated, and keep them warm in a crock pot or other heated serving appliance. * If you are cooking pasta, one of the hardest things to do is getting the water hot. If you planned to use a new pot of water each time but are getting overwhelmed, seriously consider using the same pot of water for more than one batch of pasta. It’s not how pasta is supposed to be cooked, but you don’t want hungry people waiting around for an hour. 16. Have someone designated for kitchen cleanup. Once things get started cleaning will need to be done pretty much continuously. 17. Set up your serving areas and eating tables and chairs. Consider taping banquet roll (disposable tablecloth) to the tables. Your layout should be flexible in case you get more people than expected and need to move things around. 18. Consider if some condiments, such as salt and pepper, work better at the eating tables than at the serving tables. For example, if you are serving pasta, consider putting small containers of Parmesan cheese at the eating tables. (Even simple drinking cups filled with cheese work well.) 19. Make sure garbage cans are scattered around the room, especially if you use throwaway plates and utensils.	.

This way if you are deleted, you still have control over your pages. This worked for me and i'm glad i thought of it before hand.   * If your soul purpose for your facebook account is to share photos, you may find it wise to back-up your albums. The photos once re-sized to facebook quality take up little room. It might be more than worth it to save your photos in folders of 60 (or however big your albums are), just as you have them on your account.  When the time comes to re-upload it's as easy as select all.   * Have a folder for important notes such as travel logs, tour or event dates, or writings. Wish i woulda done that. Might also help to copy-paste your 'info' somewhere, maybe just to your new account. Hold off on inviting friends to the new account until your current account is deleted to save on confusion.   * Note that uploading too much or too often is considered abusing one of their applications. To be safe i do no more than 2 albums a day, and no more than 4 a week.   * One of the things you are likely to get nailed for is tagging. Facebook sees it as a form of spamming if you go through album after album and tag every photo. Tag people in crucial shots so that they know the photos are there. Then let your friends do the rest. It's part of the fun!   * If you have a whole separate means of living besides activism, it might be handy to have two separate accounts. For instance, i have created this account solely for political protesting, and my other more personal account for my backpacking, travel and contacts. It might seem silly to go to such an extent, but this way my personal photos and travel memories are safe from deletion if my activism account goes.   *	However, it is the biggest and most used social networking tool out there today. It has played a key role in gathering the people. I have seen first-hand how amazing a tool it is to spread the word -- about anything! If we are going to keep an alternative community alive on facebook, persistence is key.

Resist giving the victim the desired attention or sympathy. A huge part of what keeps people stuck in the victim mentality is the secondary gains they receive from having this outlook. Complaining, self-loathing, and comparing can all grant the person with affection, attention, or offers of help from others. This person may not even be consciously aware of their desire for sympathy, but it’s feeding and reinforcing the behavior. * To cope with a victim in your life, you must learn to starve them. Simply stop rewarding this person with the benefits of this miserable attitude. * Perhaps you used to dedicate hours showing concern to a relentlessly complaining friend. Rather you should be clear and succinct that you will not play into the behavior. You could say “I’m sorry to hear that…” and promptly change the subject. Or, you could challenge the person to take action by asking “So, what are you going to do about it?” 2. Know that it’s not your responsibility to “fix” them.	You cannot “fix” this person or resolve their issues for them.

Understand what a consensus is. There are five requirements of consensus decision-making: * Inclusion. As many community members as possible should be involved in the process. Nobody should be excluded or left out (unless they ask to be excluded). * Participation. Not only is every person included, but each and every person is also expected to participate by contributing opinions and suggestions. While there are various roles that others may have, each person has an equal share (and stake) in the final decision. * Co-operation. All the people involved collaborate and build upon each other's concerns and suggestions to come up with a decision or solution that will satisfy everyone in the group, rather than just the majority (while the minority is ignored). * Egalitarianism. Nobody's input is weighed more or less than anyone else's. Each has equal opportunity to amend, veto, or block ideas. * Solution-mindedness. An effective decision-making body works towards a common solution, despite differences. This can come in the form of compromise, a better idea, or even dropping the potential issue completely. 2. Familiarize yourself with the arguments against using a consensus process. Many people feel and have been raised to feel that democratic voting (i.e. majority rules) is the proper solution to all decision making. This may create a win/lose situation that is less productive in the long run. Those who prefer voting often view the consensus model as inefficient and time-consuming. By understanding the resistance towards consensus building, you will be better able to address people's concerns. 3. Emphasize the benefits of using a consensus process. While both the voting method of decision making and the consensus process of decision making are meant to promote discussion, the consensus process is more likely to result in all parties reaching common ground. Both sides of an issue may need to make concessions in order for the issue to move through the process. The end result, however, is a solution that everyone can be satisfied with. It may not be exactly what anyone wanted, but it gives everyone enough of what they want to be content and will ultimately improve group cohesion with a shared plan, vision or goal, rather than create factions or an ""us against them"" mentality. 4. Clearly outline what needs to be decided. You may need to add something or take something away. You may need to start something new or amend something current. Whatever it is, make sure that the entire issue is clearly stated for everyone to understand. It's always a good idea to address why the issue is being raised in the first place (i.e. what is the problem that needs to be solved?). Briefly review the options that are available. 5. Test the waters. Before attempting a lengthy discussion, have the decision-makers vote. * If everyone agrees on a position, move on to taking action and implementing the decision. * If there is disagreement, discuss with the decision-makers the reasoning behind their votes. The consensus method requires that a solution be reached, if possible, by finding a middle ground between all parties."	.

Ask yourself what you love, care about or wish to share with others. If you're going to write about something regularly and keep your blog fresh with new information, then you need to write about something that stokes your passion or that reflects your daily experience. Try some of these ideas to get your creative juices flowing:center * Gaming. Nowadays, many people play games. You can write about games you play and post updates and/or cheats/hints. * Politics. Sure, everyone has an opinion about politics, but you may have a unique point of view that needs to be heard. * Food. Who doesn't love good food? Share your recipes, start writing reviews of the local cuisine scene or write about how the food that you ate in China was nothing like the food that Chinese restaurants serve in the United States of America. * Movies. Reviews of movies, old and new, are always fun for movie buffs. And if you keep it fresh by adding clips and pull from sources that nobody else is using, you could have a hit blog on your hands. * Cars. Are you a car enthusiast? Post pictures of your favorite new models or reports from car shows. * Love. Everybody needs some love! Maybe you can give advice about how to get a date! If you're a little more inappropriate maybe be a little sexual to get more men or women followers. * Your business. Your blog doesn't have to be a hobby. A blog can be a fantastic tool for connecting with your customers and for providing them with helpful information. 2. Think about how you want to help people. While you want to know your broad subject area, you need to focus your blog topics more narrowly, so that it has a clear purpose. Here are some ideas for ways that your blog can connect with your intended audience:center * Teach something. If you're passionate about a particular subject, and you have a lot of experience in that area, then you can offer your knowledge to both people who are new to the subject and others who are as experienced as you are. * Provide the latest news and trends. Write about the latest developments related to your topic. You want to be someone who's viewed as the ultimate insider so that you can continue to increase your blog's readership. * Make people laugh. Are you the funniest person you know? No matter what your subject area, you can present your experiences and thoughts in a humorous way that will really resonate with people. * Inspire others. Have you overcome an obstacle, such as a serious illness or a difficult life experience? Do you want to turn your challenges into something that will inspire others to overcome their problems? If that's the case, then make your blog inspirational. * Know what not to blog about too. Your workplace, your coworkers, your family members, etc. may take a dim view of anything on your blog if it blows open secrets, shares confidential information, makes fun of people you work or live with, or causes other people trouble. Know the limits––check with your workplace what is and is not permissible by way of personal blogging and ask your friends and family before including them in your posts. 3. Spy on your competition. Take a look at other blogs on your topic to see what other people are already doing. Ask yourself what you have to offer that is different from what other people are already doing. Identifying your niche will give your blog an angle that distinguishes it from your competitors.center 4. Generate some names for your blog. Try brainstorming a list of names and writing them on a piece of paper, or talk to friends and family to get ideas. You can also try freewriting to see what comes out of your mind as you free associate about your topic.center 5. Research keywords related to your subject to help people find your blog. Go to a keyword suggestion scraper site like http://ubersuggest.io/center * Enter items that are relevant to your topic into the appropriate search field. You can search by word or phrase, by website or by subject. * The tool will generate words or phrases associated with your topic. Pick the words that have a high number of monthly searches but have low to medium levels of competition. Try to include them in your blog name. * Check these keywords from time to time when you're writing a blog post. If you fit the keywords into your posts in a natural way, then search engines may be more likely to pick up on your blog and show it to people who are conducting searches about your subject. 6. Decide where to create and host your blog. Blogger and WordPress are 2 of the most popular blog creation sites on the Web.center * Blogger: Google owns Blogger and has set it up for ease of use. Your blog will be extremely easy to set up and maintain, and you'll have Google's traffic management tools at your disposal. You can purchase a custom domain name for US$10 per year or you can get a free BlogSpot domain name such as yourblog.blogspot.com. If you already own another domain name, you can use it for no cost. * Tumblr.com. This is a very handy, world-wide micro-blogging site. It provides a very friendly user interface and even helps place ads on your blog page to get you money. For more information read this article on how to create a Tumblr account. * WordPress: With WordPress, getting started will take more time. However, you'll find that WordPress has a wide variety of more sophisticated tools for enhancing and promoting your blog. You can purchase a custom domain name on WordPress for $18 per year or map an existing domain name to WordPress for $13 per year. If you want a free domain, you can use something like yourblog.wordpress.com. It is also important to note that there is a difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org. They are both free to use.	Meanwhile with Wordpress.org, you are self hosting it, so your domain will be on your selected name. The former restricts bloggers from making an income and while the latter does require set up on your own host, it then allows full access to your blog's backend, full suite of features and improved SEO performance.

Understand why you drink. In Alcoholics Anonymous, alcoholism is viewed as a disease which only a Higher Power can help you with. But outside AA, there are other models of alcohol dependence. One useful way to look at a drinking problem is to view it in terms of survival instincts. The brain is divided into two basic parts, which we will call the human brain (you) and the animal brain (it). The animal brain is concerned only with survival, and when you are chemically dependent on alcohol, it falsely thinks that you need alcohol to survive. Because of this, you could call it the ""booze brain."" If you don't understand how the booze brain works, it can easily trick the human brain (you) into drinking. However, once you understand why you drink, you are prepared to take action with the CORE process - Commit, Objectify, Respond, Enjoy. This simple process can help you stay away from alcohol for good. 2. Commit yourself to permanent abstinence from alcohol. You do not need alcohol to survive. The human brain is much smarter than the booze brain, which doesn't understand that you can live without alcohol. You can outsmart your booze brain by learning to think of it as something other than yourself. This way, when it demands alcohol, you can tell it ""never."" When you think about this, you might hear your booze brain objecting and pleading with you to ""never say never."" It does not want you to quit drinking, because it thinks it will die. But you are smarter than it is, and you know you need to stop. Make a plan to quit for good. When you're ready, say the words ""I will never drink again."" Pay attention to how you feel. If you are scared, panicked, angry, depressed, or feeling badly in some way, that is the booze brain at work."	Your body has been operating with this chemical for...however long? It thinks it needs it. It has to learn how to operate without it now, and learning has a curve. Give it time to learn. Your nerve neurons have been being put to rest for some time now, and now are all a-buzz with activity, so resting and sleep will probably be hard to get for a couple of days. Your booze brain will tell you lies. Call it a liar and watch late night TV till it passes!

Know your child. Knowing your kid will help you in being more comfortable talking to your child about life, mistakes, and confidence. Try to talk to them with a friendly attitude. 2. Let them know that mistakes can be okay. Mistakes only help you learn. Let them know it takes work to achieve a goal, but mistakes will only help them through. But, don't let them just make obvious mistakes or mistakes that will really hurt them. Make sure they're safe. 3. Motivate them in activities. Let them know that working hard will get them good things - don't bribe them, though. Motivate them in homework, school, sports, and any hobbies they may have. 4. Teach them how to deal with bullies. Let them know that they are better than any bully. Teach them that anything bad that bullies say isn't true, and that it shouldn't matter what the bullies say. 5. Teach them to think positively. Teach them that not everything should be negative, and to keep on the positive side of life. Tell them that if they catch themselves thinking negatively, to stop, rethink, and remember that anything can be positive. For example, if they lose a friend, it's not the end of the world, that just leaves room for better friends or more friends. If they're negative about a problem, instead of feeling negative, tell them to solve the problem, and even help them solve it. 6. Tell them to be grateful for what they have.	.
Save_Money_on_Gas.txt	Begin_Revision	0.88	## Steps	2787	But , be careful ; check the warnings below .	## Steps	2832	However , be careful ; check the warnings below .	<replace><But><1><However><1>	True	Steps  1. Get a credit card. Some credit cards offer gas savings when you use the card for purchases. This works in much the same way that some credit card companies give you frequent flyer miles when you use their card for purchases. (Check Links Below) 2. Get a membership card. Some gas stations offer membership benefits. There are also department and grocery stores that give discounts at the fuel pump when you use their store membership cards. Shopping at Giant Eagle grocery store and using their membership card, it's possible (at the time of this writing) to fill a car's tank for .79 cents a gallon, with savings of $1.36 per gallon. 3. Give your car a tune up. While giving your car a tune up won't actually save you money at the pump, it will save you gas. Using less gas saves you money. Have the oil changed, and have a certified mechanic give your engine a once over. 4. Check the web for deals. Web sites let you find the best deals in your area. Check out the external links below to start. 5. Buy a hybrid car. Not only do hybrid cars give you immediate savings at the pump, the U.S. government and your local state offer tax breaks for people the use gas saving cars. Federal deductions for using gas saving cars go be as high as $2000. If you can't afford the growing number of hybrid cars out there, consider getting a regular car with good MPG (miles per gallon), like the Toyota Echo. 6. Turn off the AC. Running the car's air conditioning puts extra strain on your car's engine. The translates into you car eating up more gas per mile. Use less gas, save money. Depending on the car you drive, at highway speeds, the AC might put less drag on car than if all the windows are open. So you might want to keep it cool on the highway. 7. Use the cheap stuff. Most modern cars run just as well with the cheap gas as they do with the more expensive gas. In fact, engineers assume the car buyer is going to use the cheap gas, and design the car's engine accordingly.	.

Be yourself. But if you are a direct person (like I am) – try to smile more to your colleagues and think 5 times before you snap back. Nobody likes unhappy people and will not like to listen to your problems or come to your office just to see your serious, and glummy face. 2. Don't be your own enemy. Survive ! Let everybody think that you are fond of the job you are performing by showing maximum initiative and creativity, when completing assignments you receive. 3. Try to put together a list of positive sides of your job, company, employer and staff. While doing so, keep your mind focused on positive; remember some funny stories that have happened to you recently. This will help to concentrate your thoughts and make them positive. 4. If you failed to find any positive sides, you could try to use your imagination in full and make up some positive things or even act to make changes. For instance, let's take one negative thing - a constant bad smell in the office. You could interpret this fact in your head as ""mmm it does smell bad. But I'll use lots of antismell aerosols, purchase those little funny smell improvers and hang them all over the place (or at least in your working area), also, encourage people to open windows more often, etc.” And after all the actions are implemented, you will feel like a hero, who has just saved the planet and therefore you'd come to realise what a silly thing it'd have been to have lefte such a comfortable place like the one you have just created. 5. Whenever you feel like crying - find a calculator and work out the salary which you will receive pretty soon and think of shopping, visiting, going to the theatre or whaever you could actually start doing... dancing! 6. Find a task you will definetely enjoy doing (or if not a task - an online magazine or newspaper you have always enjoyed reading). And whenever you have got a bad mood, or something wrong has again occured to you at work - just keep yourself busy with what you enjoy. For example, I am writing this article now, because I have got really mad by one of my collegues. So this is how you could distract and focus on spelling, vocabulary and other more enjoyable/enriching things. 7. Imagine your colleagues in funny situations (this works with bosses), and laugh at it when you are alone remembering about them. Laugh makes us happier. 8. If you are asked to complete a stupid task, or to do a task in a stupid way - suggest an alternative way, but if it is not approved, act like you were instructed. At the end everything will happen like you had warned. Just keep this case in mind and wait for the next stupid task to follow. When it arrives, remind politely about the previous case. 9. Try to go out for a lunch break, so that you would feel the freedom, breathe the fresh air and stay for a couple of minutes away from the working place. 10. Find people you can at least talk to, or ask for advice in the organization, but do it with utmost care having all your wits about you. This does help a lot, when you really need a bit of support and understanding. I believe that if the place is not so perfect, there will be lots of people supporting you because they have already gone through the same. But do not rely on them completely and filter what you say in public. To be on the safe side, be a bit vage, so you'll always find a way out. 11. Look for another job. Just spend your time filling in application forms and sending out CVs. This will improve your mood greatly by distracting you and giving you something to look forward to and by increasing your chances of finding a better job. 12. Be always 100% beautiful. Put on nice clothes and spare some of your morning time for make up and a perfect hairdo. A person makes a place, not a place makes a person. 13. Consider the job and place as a challenge and try to make a competition with yourself. How long will I be able to stay here? Mark a date on your calendar, when you will leave, if nothing changes. After all you will be able to see if you are strong enough to overcome the difficulties you are facing now. 14. Last, but not the least,if the money you get at this place is not the only source of income in your family, if you feel the job is no good for you and you won't reach your personal and career goals being employed by the company,look for another job and leave. Or leave straight away."	Ask for advice before taking such a drastic step !!

Note the size of the waist. 5. Ask for the flare as desired. The person/ client you are making the kurta for may ask for a slit kurta or a flared anarkali. The kurta will have two slits on either side. * If making an anarkali style top, make sure the amount of fabric that goes below the waist is enough for the wearer to walk and take strides freely.	An easy way to assess the flare is by stretching the tape far enough from one knee to the other.

Create Google alerts. You can find out if anyone is distributing copies of your music by creating a Google alert. You will need a Gmail account. Once you have created a Gmail account, you should go to the Google Alerts page and enter the information you want to have an alert created for. You should create alerts for: * your band’s name (such as “Radioactive Redwoods”) * names of each of your songs (e.g., “A Cry in the Forest”) * if you have a copyright in lyrics, then your common lyrics 2. Review your alerts daily. You should get into the habit of reviewing every alert at a set time of the day. For example, you might want to look at your alerts the first thing every morning. Try to get in the habit. * If you see that someone has posted your music on a website, then you will need to send the website owner a “takedown” notice. If the owner promptly removes the music, then they can’t be sued. Nevertheless, you must send a notice informing the owner that your music appears on their website. 3. Decide if the use is “fair use.” Before sending a takedown notice, you must make sure that you have a justified claim of infringement. In other words, the use of your music can’t be “fair use.” You need to decide whether the use of your music is “fair use” before sending a takedown notice. * Fair use is a vague concept which essentially means that some people can copy certain portions of your music in some situations. The court will look at multiple factors, such as how much of your music was sampled and whether the person sampling it “transformed” the sample. The court will also consider why the person sampled your music—for example, for education purposes or to make money—and whether the sampling had a negative effect on your ability to make money from the song. * Generally, you will be justified in sending a takedown notice in most situations. For example, if someone uses an entire song or almost an entire song, then you are justified in sending a takedown notice. *	If you are unsure, then contact an attorney for advice.

Don’t panic. You might feel anxious or afraid that you’ve been confronted with accusations of racism. What will happen to your career? To your personal reputation? Don’t worry about these potential outcomes. Instead, focus on the immediate situation, your feelings about it, and potential solutions. If you begin worrying about all the potential ramifications of an accusation of racism, you’ll only make yourself crazy. * If you need to, take a breather to calm down and free yourself of the anxiety you feel over being accused of racism. Step out to lunch or take a quick nap. 2. Don’t act in anger. It’s okay to be angry that you’re being labeled a racist. But do not speak or act in a way motivated by your frustration. This will only compound the problem. If you’re facing the accusation in a face-to-face encounter, take a deep breath before responding. Don’t shout or call names of the person who considers you a racist. If need be, excuse yourself to gather your thoughts and calm down before you say or do something that you’ll later regret. * Think before you speak. If you feel angry, let the person know. Say “I am most certainly not a racist and think it’s unfair of you to characterize me as such.” 3. Avoid negative responses to the accusation. Do not flee from, freeze up when confronted by, or concede sarcastically to the individual who called you a racist. For instance, if someone calls you a racist, do not say sardonically, “Yes, I am such a racist!” when in fact, you do not consider yourself one. Alternately, though you may be totally blindsided by the charge that you’re a racist, do not stand there, stuttering and dumbstruck, or run out of the room, embarrassed. Gather your thoughts and think of what to say to the accuser. * Running away from the person who thinks you’re racist will not make the problem go away. * Don’t make it about you. You might be upset, but you should not cry, yell, or counter-accuse anyone of racism or anything else. These responses are immature and counterproductive. 4. Forgive the person who accused you.	If the accuser apologizes, let their accusation go. Recognize that the person made an honest mistake and let it go at that. Put yourself in their shoes and think about how you’d feel if the situation they thought had occurred actually had. What would you feel or say?

Use aluminum foil for an easy, low-cost method for removing rust from chrome. Since aluminum is softer than steel, it will not scratch the surface of the chrome. Also, this is a chemical process that produces a fine metal polishing compound and creates a bright shine on the chrome surface. * This method also means you won’t have to push as hard as using the steel wool because the rust is dissolving chemically. 2. Clean the chrome using soapy water. Before you attempt to remove the rust on the chrome it is best to make sure all the dirt and other debris are removed. This helps you to see and access the rust more easily for removal. * If the dirt is very difficult to remove you can also use vinegar to clean the surface of the chrome. Vinegar is a mild acid and will help in the process of rust removal as well. 3. Collect some aluminum foil and a bowl of water. You will need some aluminum foil and a small bowl of water to clean the chrome. The amount of aluminum foil needed depends on the amount of rust you are attempting to clean. 4. Tear pieces of the aluminum foil. Tear smaller pieces of the aluminum foil to make it easier to rub down the chrome. Use pieces that are about 3-4 inches (7.5-10 cm) square to make it easiest. You can use larger or smaller pieces if you choose. 5. Dip the foil in the water. Dip the torn piece of aluminum foil in the bowl of water to coat the foil. This will help in the process of removing the rust. * Add extra water to the surface of the chrome for a super fine finish. 6. Rub the aluminum foil over the rust spots. Gently rub the aluminum foil back and forth over the rust spots. Try not to apply too much pressure but rather simply rub the foil over the spots. Heavily rusted areas may need additional pressure but you should be able to remove them by just rubbing the foil over the surface for a longer period of time. * Dip the aluminum foil in water again when it gets dry. You want the foil to remain moist when rubbing areas. * If you are working on a severely pitted surface then try wadding up the piece of aluminum foil. The edges that this creates will help to smooth down the metal. 7. Stop every so often to remove the rust residue.	This way you can see the remaining rust and continue rubbing it with the aluminum foil.

Wash the gasket. If your towels smell like mildew, sometimes the wash machine could be a part of the problem. It's most likely that the mildew smell is coming from your towels, but it could also be from mold build up in the washer. Washing the gasket is very important to eliminating mildew smells coming from the washer. The gasket is the rubber seal that prevents water from leaking out when a load is washing. Wipe down the gasket with a rag dunked in soapy water, or sprayed with a mild mildew cleanser. You could also use a cleaning solution of 50% water 50% bleach. * Consider using an old toothbrush to get hand to reach places of the gasket. * Make sure to get all areas of the gasket. You may need to pull back sections of the gasket to get into small rubber folds. 2. Clean the detergent dispensers. Remove the detergent dispensers from the machine and scrub them with a soapy water mixture. Leftover soap residue or stagnant water can make this area of your wash machine smell bad too. * If the dispensers cannot be removed from the machine, do your best to clean inside the dispense with a rag or pipe cleaners. 3. Run a cleaning cycle. Run a wash cycle using the longest and hottest setting. Add one of the following straight into the washing basin of the machine: * 1 cup of bleach. * 1 cup of baking soda. * 1/2 cup of powdered enzymatic dishwasher detergent * 1/2 cup of a commercial residue-busting washer cleaner * Run a complete cycle. If the mildew smell remains, try another cycle, or replacing one of the additives with vinegar. It might take several cycles to get the smell out. 4. Seek professional care. If none of these methods help with getting rid of the mildew smell, you may need to call a professional to come look at your wash machine. There may be mold growing back behind the drum of the machine, or perhaps a clogged drain or filter. * A certified repair man can assist you with diagnosing what is wrong with your machine, and may be able to dismantle the machine to find the source of the smell if need be. 5. Take preventative measures. Once you figure out if where the mildew smell is coming from, take some preventative measures to ensure that mold doesn't accumulate again. You might want to consider: * Airing the wash machine out. Leave the wash machine door cracked open between cycles.	.

Explore pay-per-click advertising. Buying traffic is the quickest way to bring people to your site, and vendors will allow you to target specific geographical areas with keyword searches. Make sure you are targeting the right audience. Clicks cost you money, and if tons of visitors leave without purchasing your services or product, you can lose money. There are two major advertisers: * GoogleAds – Your ads appear in the sidebar when someone enters certain search terms that you select. * Facebook – Your ads appear in the newsfeed for an audience that you select according to location, sex, age, and interests. The more specific your audience, the more successful you will be. 2. Make contacts and establish affiliate sites. Find quality sites related to your business and ask if you can advertise on their site, in return for their advertising on yours. Affiliate sites bring high quality traffic that often translates into sales. * As an example, if you are operating a business to teach English to non-English speakers, perhaps consider reaching out to a high-quality site that provides services to recent immigrants. Advertising through a site like that could bring in traffic for you, whereas by advertising on your site, their business could access your customer base. 3. Create a social media presence. Americans spend 1 out of every 7 minutes on social media, and this represents a tremendous marketing opportunity. Start by focusing on the platform your customers are most likely to be on and build a presence there. * Create a Facebook page. Every business should have one, even if this isn’t your main social media outlet. * Post pictures on Pinterest, particularly if targeting women 18-65, as this is Pinterest's most popular demographic. * Don’t forget video sites like Youtube.com. Youtube can be an effective way to create content that can simultaneously work to market your services and to educate customers. For example, if you offer a membership-based site that provides investing advice to customers, use Youtube to create free advice content, which can then link to your product or service. * Post on social media frequently – at least several times a week, and preferably once a day or more. Pictures are an easy way to do this. Also, keep followers up to date on new products, sales, and other business-related info. 4. Publish an e-newsletter. A weekly or monthly newsletter is one of the best ways to use your email list. Make sure to provide value-added content that people want to read, instead of intrusive sales pitches. For example, if you are a graphic designer, offer helpful information about how graphic design and branding solutions can work to attract new customers. * Consider writing a blog as a replacement or in addition to an e-newsletter. Every published blog post has the potential to increase your search engine ranking, therefore making it an excellent way to draw in new customers via the internet. As mentioned before, try to make your content useful, rather than a simple sales pitch. For example, if you offer computer training, you might review a newly released computer, or if you’re an accountant, you might discuss some new rules impacting this year’s taxes. * Consider guest blogging. Contributing quality content to related blogs shows off your expertise and can bring people to your site. 5. Use press releases. A quality press will be picked up by major search engines and hundreds of websites and posting one is relatively inexpensive, typically $200 to $300. There are several wire services to choose from, including PR Newswire and PR Web. 6. Promote your website in the real world. Mention your site to customers and friends, and make sure your web address is printed on everything, including your letterhead, business card, and any brochures you might have. * Keep in mind that simply because your business is online does not mean you cannot benefit tremendously from traditional advertising methods, and this is especially true if your online or home-based business relies on or markets to local customers. A graphic design service, for example, can benefit tremendously not only from internet traffic, but also from relationships with local businesses and organizations. * If your business fits this profile, consider taking out advertisements in newspapers or on radio, or attending local networking events related to your product or service. 7. Keep up with reviews on sites like Yelp and Kudzu. Good reviews are a great way to get business, and the best way to get them is to provide friendly, quality service and great products.	.

When you have a gemstone with a girdle that is wider than 1mm, Ready made pre-notched settings won't fit your stone. 3. To see if your setting is the correct shape/size, Place your setting over the gemstone upside down. Don't push it down .If it is the right size, the prongs will be about 1/2mm smaller than the gemstone. You want the prongs so that the setting will take a little effort to snap into place. The stone Shown being set in this ring is actually an 11x8mm, So we know the setting will have to be adjusted. 4. As You can see from our test, the stone is too large for this setting. This particular setting is calibrated for a 10x8mm Oval & the stone used is actually an 11x8mm 5. A tip: When you have a little larger stone [atleast a 5 or 6mm size stone] the setting can be adjusted about 1mm larger or even smaller than it's listed size. you would only be adjusting one prong on each side a tiny 1/2mm. for example: if you have at stone that is a 7.5mm round you can adjust either a 7mm up or an 8mm down to fit. You only need to adjust about 1/4mm each prong. 6. Now if you decide you do need to adjust your setting to fit. You will need to carefully bend each of the four prongs in [or out as needed] as shown in picture with a pair of flat jaw pliers. Do this in very small steps.Notice in the picture that you bend the length of the prong from the attached base to the end of the prong. That way it stays nice & straight.All four prongs needed to go out at least a 1/2mm in this case 7. Test your stone again upside down as mentioned before.When the setting looks slightly smaller than your stone.perhaps 1/2mm smaller, you can set your stone. This is done by pushing down on the upside down setting over the stone.You should only need to apply Gentle pressure. Continue pushing until all the prongs snap into position with the girdle setting in the notches of each of the prongs. Your stone shouldn't move around easily in the setting.If it does not fit correctly, you will have to start over & adjust the prongs again. 8. Here is a picture of the perfectly snapped in stone. 9. When you think it looks like all the notches are snugged against the edge of your stone, you are not finished yet ! you will have to bend the top of each prong in toward the center of your stone so that it covers the edge of the gemstone. You need to bend the prong from the notch to the end of the prong in toward the center. The tip of each prong is bent inward to cover a small portion of the gemstone. Work your way around on opposing prongs bending a little at time.	.

If you've experienced one or more of the following symptoms, you may be an alcoholic and should consider quitting drinking. * Drinking in the morning. * Drinking alone. * Feelings of guilt after drinking. * Making attempts to hide your drinking from others. * You have difficulty stopping yourself once you have one drink. * You've experienced withdrawal symptoms after not drinking for several hours, including sweating, shaking, anxiety, and nausea. 2. Evaluate your goal. After you've decided that you should cut back on alcohol or quit altogether, you need to set a concrete goal. * If your goal is to quit completely, write out ""I will stop drinking alcohol on this date."" Set a specific date on which you will quit. This will give you a tangible target to aim for. * Perhaps you don't want to quit entirely, but for health reasons you decide you'd like to only drink on Friday and Saturday. Write out a goal like, ""As of this date, I will only drink on Fridays and Saturdays."" Again, it is important to set a concrete date for when this will start. Also state how many drinks you will allow yourself to have on the occasion that you do drink. * If you only plan on reducing your intake, then a full detox may not be necessary for you. The following parts of this list mostly refer to people who will be quitting entirely. 3. Announce your goal. Let the people around you know of your plans. This way, you can start building your support system for when you begin detoxing. * Let the people around you know what you will require of them. It may be as simple as asking them to not offer you drinks, or you may need them to not drink around you at all. Whatever your needs are, make sure you are up front about them. * It is especially important to make your goals clear to friends who you used to drink with. Peer pressure causes many people to cave. If these people do not support your goal and pressure you to drink, you may need to distance yourself from them. 4. Remove alcohol from your home."

The sad fact is that most of you could not even begin to grasp what true competitive gaming really requires of you and your team. So were going to be looking into some of these issues in this guide about where every team should be and what every team should be doing. With that being said, well be talking about how to train teams properly. So we’ll start off by going over exactly what every team needs to be doing in order to be playing at that truly competitive level. Whether you’re a newly formed team, established team, semi-pro team, or even a pro team. What is written in this guide is exactly what you all should be doing and nothing less. The fact of the matter is that everyone never maxes out their potential, it just doesn't happen, you will always have something to learn and being open-minded about it and willing to take advice from people is the first step to playing at that truly competitive level. Never deny yourself the chance to gain knowledge, because when you allow yourself to attain information, that's just that much more you will know over the next guy. The point of gaming is to always improve, so why is it that we see these people on xbl always saying, ""oh you don't know what you’re talking about, your just a bk, go away you random!” some might say. But the fact of the matter is that what that person may have said to you even though the way he said it may not have been the best way to approach you, could honestly be some of the best advice you've heard so far. And this is why you should never close yourself off and become defensive or let your pride take over because you think you can beat this person in a 1 on 1. Because that's not what this is about and will solve nothing. Now there are proper ways to train as a team. To be honest, it's really beyond me how 99.9% of you do not pick up on these logical ways of doing things. So let's start. We’ll start with the team aspect of this first. This will be vol.1 team play-the general stuff. Now keep in mind, this guide is not meant to make you aware of these things, it's to show you all that none of you do these things 100% of the time for every single match you play. this is what the guide is truly showing, what you should be doing 100% of the time, no matter if you’re in a pub, private, scrim, custom, or real match. Taking the initiative, self-discipline, self-motivation, self-dedication, a proper work ethic, and being mentally fit is what is going to take you where you want to go. And trust me, every gamer wants to be here, but it's just how we get there is the issue. The team when you first create your team, make sure that you find players that you know for a fact want to achieve something more than just being some pub-all stars, because if not, you will go nowhere. The first thing that your team should do is understand that competitive gaming and especially wanting to go pro is the equivalent of a full-time job. This is first thing that needs to be comprehended and understood by all. How to recruit the best thing I can offer for this would be to have anyone that your looking to pick up take a look at this guide, because now you'll know that if they read this guide and understand everything, then there is a good chance that they are now on the same level of awareness as you are. So imo I truly do believe that the mental game out-weighs physical skill (this includes: reaction time, accuracy, and being able to handle clutch situations more effectively). The reasoning for this is that the mental game applies to literally everything. Being calm and collective in-game, patient, openly aware, focused 100% of the time, and makes rational decisions. Physical skill can be molded and can always be improved. But the mental skill comes down to you and your DNA make-up, whether they be moral beliefs or personal characteristics. I prefer to recruit players, who may not be the best individual players, but they listen and learn; they are open-minded. I recruit the mentally fit players, because their physical skill will constantly be improving by the more their learning about the game. Remember this. A mentally fit player is a dependable player. Scheduling your team The best way to go about this is to have your tc (team captain) or someone on the team, take down everyone's schedule. now your schedule should include a specific weekly forecast of your life. every day needs to be specifically planned out or to the best of your knowledge. then after you've acquired everyone's schedule match up the times for everyone and write down new universal times when every player can be on. then from there, add up the total amount of hours per week your team will be putting into the game every week. it should be no less than 40 hours a week (equivalent of a full-time job). training your team a.k.a. your teams work ethic when you team of 4 is finally set, the first job that you will have is to go map out spawn points, now this is most easily done by having map layouts in front of you (purchasing the prima strategy guide would most likely be your best bet as it comes fully equipped with everything you will need). if you can acquire map layouts online for free then by all means take the free route. then take your team, go into private match, run through all the mlg variant maps while spawning and then switching sides constantly in order to find all of the spawn points for that map. then move on to the next map. keep in mind that in ffa gametypes, there will always be more spawn points than in team gametypes."	make sure everyone has a copy of this.

Pull_a_Backflip_on_Your_Dirtbike.txt	Begin_Revision	0.957	## Steps	350	Once you approach the ramp , let off a bit of gas , just enough to get your RPM 's down before the jump .	## Steps	396	As you approach the ramp , let off a bit of gas , just enough to get your RPM 's down before the jump .	<replace><Once><1><As><1>	True	Steps  1. Build or find a foam pit. Building your own is suggested. Go out and find something to keep the foam inside a box, so like a whole bunch of boards filled with your choice of foam or an old house with the roof off and fill it with foam, something to keep the foam inside. Now you want to make sure all the sides are secure from falling so get nails or whatever you need to secure the sides of the boards. Now when you jump into the foam pit with your bike you need to get it out. I use my tractor and put a chain on the bucket, you might want to try something else if you do not have a tractor. I suggest making a crane out of pullies and rope, strong enough to lift your bike (test it a couple times on the ground) Once that is complete, then you are set to go! 2. Put your ramp up, bring in your ramp that you have made (you can find articals on how to make ramps on the internet) and put it very close to the edge of the pit. You want this ramp clsoe to a 50, 60 degree angle. That is pretty step but you will be able to fly off it and spin easily with the power of your bike (depending on your cc size) So put your ramp about 4 meters from the ramp (this is were your going to start your flips) 3. Hit your ramp a few times to get the feeling of the jump, try pulling back on your bars and gunning the throttle then kick away from your bike (dont let the bike fly over the foam pit, not a good idea) Once you have hit the jump enough to start the backflips and feel confident, its time to try it 4. Focus mainly on your take-off and exit. I mean take-off by how much you have to pull back on your bars and throttle, the exit as in were are you going to land, how are you going to land if you mess up how are you going to get off the bike in time 5. Don't spend to much time on step 4 becasue it'll break your confidence after a long time, so quickly think of the take-off and exit. Now dont think of anything but hitting the jump and pulling it (pretend that you've already dont it and your doing it again) So hit third gear, this is the best gear to start in for the backflip, lots of power for a short distance 6.	Lean forward on your bars once your going on the ramp, at the top throttle, pull back on your bars, lean back and keep that throttle punched until you completed the rotation. The Gyro effect will give it an extra little boost if you keep that throttle punched. Once your starting to go upside down, DO NOT FREAK OUT and jump off, the bike may land on top of you or you will hurt yourself, its smart to stay on the bike as long as you can until the last secound. Okay, once your upside down, tilt you head back as far as possible to spot your landing, then bring the bars back up to your chest as hard as you can. Once completed the rotation, let go of the gas and smash into the foam pit.

Research current networks and development reports. Subscribe to Hollywood trade publications (known as ""the trades"") or other web resources, like the ubiquitous Deadline.com (a must-read), to get a handle on what's currently being developed and produced by a studio or network. For example, Deadline reported last year that NBC was pushing big on medical dramas. What does that mean for you? That this year medical dramas are a lot less likely to sell, as NBC is currently developing 5-6 of them. * Visit the directories to get the complete list of industry contacts, cross-referenced by company, name, and show, and keep notes of names that are frequently attached to projects like yours. 2. Create a ""hit-list"" of appropriate companies to approach. Once you know what kind of studios are producing things like your idea, make a list of all the relevant companies and find out if they accept unsolicited pitches. The best way to do this is through their website. Find phone numbers, emails for assistants, and anything that talks about idea generation (such as ""pitch ideas""). * This is largely a matter of common sense -- you wouldn't pitch a cheesy monster movie to NBC, you'd send it to SyFi. You wouldn't send over a period drama to Judd Apatow's production company. Think about what the studio is already making to pitch to the right people. * Many large studios have fellowship programs, which are paid 6-8 week programs that help you develop and hone your ideas. They are, however, incredibly competitive and pay very little. 3. Network with everyone you can. Meeting people is still the number one way to sell an idea. Whenever you meet someone who is even tangentially involved in making films, set up a time to get coffee together. Even if this person isn't able to make your idea a reality, they may know someone who can. That said, do not make friends simply to try and get famous -- just be your normal, friendly self and offer up your ideas organically. * When possible, work on film and TV sets as a production assistant or intern. You'll meet hundreds of industry contacts who may one day need a new idea to work on. * If you've published before, or have industry experience, you could consider hiring an agent, though it is not strictly necessary. * While not strictly necessary, selling your idea to Hollywood is easiest if you're in Hollywood. If you're really serious, it's time to move to LA. 4. Consider sending your idea through a pitching service. These sites, which charge you a nominal fee to host and ""directly"" pitch your idea to development executives, have a spotty track record."	Be sure to thoroughly vet a pitching service before sending them money.

Determine the age level(s) of schooling, to which you are referring. In the United States, high school refers to a compulsory education for students ages fourteen through eighteen. However, this is not the case in many Spanish speaking countries. Schooling is broken up differently in other countries. * In Mexico, if you are referring to students age twelve to fifteen, they attend what is comparable to junior high school. This school is called secundaria, and it is an extension of educación básica (elementary school). Students ages fifteen to eighteen, however, attend what is called preparatoria, bachillerato, or educación media superior. * In Spain, students twelve to sixteen years old, attend either an instituto de educación secundaria (instituto for short), colegio concertado or colegio privado. Schooling at this point is still compulsory. After this point, schooling is not compulsory for all students. However, many students, sixteen to eighteen years of age, attend bachillerato or go to ciclos formativos. 2. Research the type of high school. Sometimes, different schools entail different training. Different kinds of schools determine the career path their students take. Additionally, whether the school is public or private can mean a difference in the quality of education and how much their parents have to pay. * For example, in Spain el bachillerato is the school on track to university. In el bachillerato studies, students earn a certificate that is mandatory to attend university. Students also prepare for their Prueba de Acceso a la Universidad, or university admittance exam, which they must take for university admittance. The other track students take in high school is Ciclos Formativos. This program is through Spain's institutos, and consists of vocational training. When most students leave these programs, they are ready to work as a hair dressers, technicians etc.. * In Mexico, el bachillerato is also the main track to university. Prepartoria, on the other hand, is more geared toward vocational training so that when a student graduates they are ready to work in a specific vocation. For example, students who graduate from prepartoria might be ready to work as a laboratory technician. *	In Chile, for example, there has been a major shift toward the privatization schools. Many parents seek out private schools, privado or semi-privado, that they pay all or part of the tuition of, to better prepare their students for college.

Jump up and bring 1 leg over the bull to sit in the saddle. Some people have trouble initially mounting the bull because it may be too tall. Most mechanical bulls are surrounded by bouncy, padded flooring. Use this padding to hop up and get your right or left leg over the bull. Then, use your hands and arms to steady yourself on top. Your legs should hang down on each side of the bull’s back. * Try not to jump too high, you might miss and jump over the bull completely. 2. Hold on to the rope palm up with your non-dominant hand. Mechanical bulls will either have a padded strap or a long rope handle that you can hold on to. Use this after you jump up on the bull to stable yourself and adjust your positioning. It is best to hold on to it underhanded with your non-dominant hand. * Holding on to the rope underhand allows for the best stability when the bull is in motion. It also helps you to release your grip more easily when you fall. 3. Move your body forward in the saddle and squeeze it with your thighs. It’s best to position your body as far forward on the saddle as you can. This will help to minimize your movement, which will ultimately keep you on the bull longer. Once you are far up on the saddle, squeeze the sides of the bull with your thighs so you are firmly rooted to the bull’s body. 4. Pull your legs forward and dig in your heels. When you’re sitting on the bull, make sure your legs are positioned forward, instead of angled behind you. If your feet are behind you, it will be harder for you to balance while the bull is moving and you may fall forward on the bull.	This will allow you to get a better grip on the bull with your feet.

Never compare yourself with others. Everyone, I mean everyone, gets started at a different place and heads on their own journey. You have no idea where theirs can get them to. Blindly making a comparison equals to wasting time. 2. Stop getting entangled with what's out of your control. The point is getting to know and focusing on something important to you, such as the economy, your market, actions that others may take. That's to say: your inner ideas and your actions. 3. Know and keep your own boundaries. Sometimes your work seems incredibly important in your world. But you're killing a part of yourself when you let your work nibble your privacy and integrity. 4. Never over-commit to yourself or your team. It's wonderful that you're passionate enough to target higher. However, it easily result in failures and disappointments when you over-do it to yourself and your team. 5. Keep in mind that you are entitled to the same amount of time with others. It seems that you always need more time to get your things done.	Nobody gets more than you, so stop complaining.

Deliver the notice to your attorney-in-fact. As soon as you want the letter to take effect, or as soon as you have it prepared, you must deliver it to your attorney-in-fact. If you are familiar with each other, you may deliver it in hand. If you are concerned with keeping a formal record of delivery, you may choose to have it sent by certified mail. * The method of delivery is not as important as the timing and being able to prove that, in fact, the letter was delivered. For example, if you gave someone power of attorney to manage investments for you during your absence, and then you want that power to stop on a specific time and date, you may need to prove that the notice was delivered and received before that time. 2. Notify any other individuals or institutions who were aware of the power of attorney. When you revoke a power of attorney, the key is to tell your attorney-in-fact to stop working for you, and also to tell other people to stop relying on that person.	.

Turn off the infected computer. Open the case and remove its main hard drive (the one containing the OS partition). 2.

Open the case and connect the infected drive. 4. Turn on the clean computer. Make absolutely sure that it boots into the clean OS, not from the infected drive! Most PCs have a boot choice menu which can be accessed via the F11 or ESC key soon after power on. 5. Once the clean computer's OS has booted, you are going to want to clean out temp files from the infected drive, in order to make it easier to search. But first, you want to see all files, even hidden and system files. Go to ""Control Panel"" -> ""Folder Options"", and click on the ""View"" tab at the top of the ""Folder Options"" window. You are going to want to change the following options: * Turn ON: Display the contents of System Folders * Turn ON: Show hidden files and folders * Turn OFF: Hide extensions for known file types. * Turn OFF: Hide protected operating system files (Recommended) 6. Take note of the drive letter of your infected drive. It's probably going to be E: or F:, depending on the number of hard drives, partitions, and CD/DVD drives you have in your clean computer. I'm going to assume that we're dealing with the F: drive for this article. 7. Temp files are stored in the following locations. Some of these locations may not exist, some may be in slightly different places. It's important that you find and clear the cache for all of your browsers (IE/Netscape/Firefox/Opera) and that you clear it for every single user! Check the following folders and delete their contents, but not the directories themselves. * F:\TEMP * F:\Windows\TEMP or F:\WINNT\Temp (Only NT4 and Windows 2000 use ""WinNT"") * F:\WINNT\Profiles\UserName\Local Settings\Temp * F:\WINNT\Profiles\UserName\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files * F:\WINNT\Profiles\UserName\Local Settings\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\SomeRandomName.default\Cache * F:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Local Settings\Temp * F:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files * F:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Local Settings\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\SomeRandomName.default\Cache 8.

Talk to your teen about the situation. One of the most important aspects of your teen's recovery is open and effective communication. However you find out about your teen's steroid abuse, be it through spotting symptoms or hearing about it from someone else, you need to confront them. Although your child may not want to speak about your concerns, you must be persistent regarding their health. 2. Ask your teen about the problem if they are willing to talk to your about it. Open up a discussion but do not get angry with them. Be there for them, allowing them to feel that they are safe and can express themselves fully. Ask your child about why they are abusing steroids and where they have been gaining access to them. You should try to obtain this information to help your child, not to punish them. Some things you may want to discuss include: * Your teen’s stress level. Talk to your child about their stress levels and even their self-esteem. Are they feeling pressured by others? Get to the root of the problem. Once you find out the reasoning, you have already achieved the first vital step. 3. Consider purchasing a home drug testing kit if your child is unwilling to talk. It is common for teens to deny their steroid abuse. If this is the case and your teen absolutely refuses to talk to you, you can purchase a home drug testing kit.	At this point you will know for a fact, and will need to take the necessary steps to help them succeed in their recovery.

Why do you feel the urge to talk about your friends? Do you feel as if you need to share a juicy piece of gossip about another pal in appear to be more interesting or funny? Or are you currently unhappy with your life and talking about other friend’s misfortune or misery feeds your soul? Either way you need to get to the root of why you talk about people behind their back in order to stop. * Insecurity. People who are not comfortable in their own skin and have insecurities will often pick apart others in order to feel better. * Boredom. Feel as if your life is totally boring and without excitement? Dragging out other’s dirty laundry can get the conversation started and cook up some thrills. * Revenge. Some people may be angry with a friend and feel that the only way they will feel vindicated is to talk about them behind their back--whether they already hashed it out with the friend or not. * Humor. During these sarcastic times when sitcom stars hurl insults as if they were nothing, some folks think they are being funny by making snarky remarks about friends behind their back. 2. Consider the kind of damage you are doing. If you were to stop and recall your words and think about what you said, what kind of damage are you doing to another person? * Personal reputation. Spreading gossip about another person, whether it’s true or not should not be your place. Are you destroying another person’s reputation and why do you believe you should bring this person down? If you are gossiping because you seek revenge is this the best way to resolve your conflict? * Business reputation. Are you ruining someone’s livelihood just for personal fodder? Consider what your words could be doing to another person’s financial security and how it could impact not only the person, but also his or her family. * Family reputation. Even though you may be talking about your friend, your words could hurt his or her family, including children. Family members are innocent bystanders and should not be hurt or damaged by your words. 3. Know the difference between damaging gossip, venting to friends or simply conveying information about another friend. In some cases you are spreading great news about a friend or may be simply venting about a fight you had with one close friend. Knowing the difference between indiscriminately talking behind a friend’s back versus delivering information is important. * Venting. We all need to let off some steam and if you’ve had a fight with a friend you may want to consult with another pal to help you through the issue. Talking with a trusted friend who you know won’t talk about your discussion with others should be fine. Talking it out may provide you with insight and help you arrive at conflict resolution with your other friend.	.
Recognize_the_Symptoms_of_Appendicitis.txt	Begin_Revision	0.919	### Seeking Medical Attention	13728	However , it 's still surgery — so take care of yourself accordingly .	### Seeking Medical Attention	13820	But , it 's still surgery — so take care of yourself accordingly .	<replace><However><1><But><1>	True	"Seeking Medical Attention  1. Avoid medications until you get treatment. If you feel that you have the symptoms of appendicitis, then it's important not to make your situation worse as you wait for treatment in the emergency room. Here's what you should avoid as you wait to be treated: * Don't take laxatives or pain medication. Laxatives might irritate your intestines further, and pain meds can make it harder for you to monitor any spikes in abdominal pain. * Don't take antacids. They can worsen pain associated with appendicitis. * Don't use heating pads, which can cause an inflamed appendix to rupture. * Don't eat or drink anything until you've been examined, because this can make you at a higher risk for aspiration during surgery. 2. Get to an emergency room quickly. If you feel reasonably certain you have appendicitis, don't just pick up the phone and make a doctor's appointment for later in the week. Go to a hospital as soon as possible. Appendicitis is potentially life-threatening if the appendix bursts without treatment. * Pack some overnight items, such as fresh pajamas and your toothbrush. If you have appendicitis, you'll be getting surgery and staying overnight. 3. Explain your symptoms at the emergency room. Be prepared for triage and tell the triage nurse that you suspect appendicitis. You'll then be ranked on a list of patients who need care according to the immediacy of their injuries. That means if someone comes into the ER with a head injury, you might have to wait a little bit. * Don't panic if you have to wait. Once you're in the hospital, you're a lot safer than you are at home. Even if your appendix bursts in the waiting room, they'll be able to get you into surgery quickly. Try to be patient and take your mind off the pain. 4. Know what to expect from the exam. When you do see a doctor, you'll need to describe your symptoms again. Note any digestive abnormalities (such as constipation or vomiting), and try to tell the doctor when you first noticed the pain. The doctor will examine you for signs of appendicitis. * Expect to be prodded. The doctor will press on your lower abdomen, hard. The doctor is checking for peritonitis, or the infection that results from a burst appendix. If you do have peritonitis, your abdominal muscles will spasm when pressed. The doctor might also perform a quick rectal exam. 5. Expect additional tests. Lab testing and imaging are important for the official diagnosis of appendicitis. Possible tests include: * Blood test - This will identify a high white blood cell count, which shows a sign of infection, even before a low grade temperature is seen. The blood test will also show if there is an imbalance of electrolytes and dehydration, which can cause pain as well. The doctor may also do a pregnancy test to rule out the possibility in a woman. * Urinalysis - The urine will show a possible urinary tract infection or kidney stone which may also present with abdominal pain at times. * Ultrasound - An ultrasound of the abdomen will show if there is a blockage in the appendix, a rupture of the appendix, swelling of the appendix, or another reason for the abdominal pain. The ultrasound is the safest form of radiation, and usually the first resort for imaging. * MRI - MRIs are used to do a more detailed picture of the internal organs without using an x-ray. Expect to be a little claustrophobic in the MRI machine. It's a tight space. Many physicians may order a light sedation to help ease the anxiety. It will also show the same signs as the ultrasound, but a little closer of a look. * CT Scan - CT scan will use an x-ray with computer technology to show images. You will be given a solution to drink. If you do not vomit the solution you can lie on the table to do the test. It is a pretty quick procedure, and not claustrophobic like the MRI machine. This test will also show the same signs of inflammation, bursting, or blockage of the appendix and is used most commonly. 6. Get an appendectomy. Your doctor may determine that you do have appendicitis. The only cure for appendicitis is to remove the appendix in a surgery called an appendectomy. Most surgeons prefer the laparoscopy type of surgery, which leaves less of a scar, rather than an open appendectomy. * If your doctor does not think you need surgery, he may send you home to be ""on watch"" for 12 to 24 hours. During that time, you shouldn't take antibiotics, pain medicine, or laxatives. In this situation, you should contact your provider if you get worse. Don't wait for your symptoms to resolve. You may need to return with a urine sample. When you return for another examination, you need to make sure not to eat or drink anything in advance because this could cause complications in surgery. 7. Pace your recovery. Modern appendectomies are minimally invasive, and you should be able to return to normal life with few to no complications."	Here's what you should do to get back in shape after surgery:

Choose a cause. Some good ideas might be something like, ""Save the whales!"" or ""Stop global warming!"" the cause should also relate to where you are. For example, 'save the whales' might not be such a good idea if you live 10 hours to the nearest whale location, whereas 'keep our state clean' would work anywhere. But nothing says you can't do more than one cause. Your club could do a different cause every month. For example, you could do saving polar bears in November, pandas in December and global warming in January. 2. Name your club. This can be as simple as 'The Environmental Club' or as cool as 'Team Environment'. Some words you could use are green, tree-hugger, and, of course, something that relates to your cause. Then you can start accepting members. 3. Start researching. Now that you have your club, you all need to assign days you will get together to study your cause. After the club members are experts on the cause, research places where you can help or protest, depending on your cause. 4. Find a clubhouse. Your club must have a place where it gets together to have meetings and discuss your projects. It could be in the woods (just don't litter), in someone's room, living room, tree house, or your yard, there are endless possibilities. 5. Have meetings. Find a time that suits most of your club members(if not all) and talk about possible projects. They could be fund-raisers, clean-ups, spreading awareness, it should relate to what you have been researching. 6. Decide on jobs. Each club member should have a certain job they need to do. Some you could include are recruiter, site admin, activity manager, Project manager, the President who decides all the meeting times, new members, meeting places, activities, and projects. (The president only decides on them, does not think them up.) 7. Have activities. Your club should have some fun activities to do every once in a while to remind them what they are fighting for. These could be hikes in the forest, watching environmental movies (such as ""An Inconvenient Truth, or even ""WALL-E""), or anything else you can think of that would apply to the environment (don't use this as an excuse to spend your meetings watching movies and eating pop-corn), only do these once a month or twice a month or the group may become too passive. 8. Do projects. At your meetings, decide on a few projects, and do them. When you're done with the few projects you have chosen, decide on a few more. And after that, a few more."	The projects could be anything from fund-raisers to park clean-ups and even to handing out brochures on a cause (be sure to print them on recycled paper, or don't print it at all because recycling still pollutes).

Keep your child away from dramatic environments. As a child has a young mind, he is a very curious body. In childhood, from age 3 to 6, children adapt from their surroundings and what happens near them makes a remarkable change in their personalities. This change can remain for a lifetime, which is why it is necessary to keep a child away from tense crowds. This includes: * Family arguments * Street fights * A snappy behavior to someone * Abusive environment * Bad school atmosphere 2. Coax your child to tell if you if they are suffering from a problem. This might be in their school, with their friends, physical trouble, disturbance from their teachers or other family members. Don’t push them to tell you but gently speak to them about how you may be able to solve their difficulty. Tell them that they should trust you. Give them a little space and some time. 3. Retain your child from the place where there is a controversy or tension.	Tell them to go and play, or give them a chore to do. Do this pleasantly and keep the desperation out of your voice. Children are very observant, and they might take notice of the despair in your tone. If the child happens to be stubborn and remains in the room, then calmly talk to the person you are disputing with. Better still, don’t argue then. If you do, don’t glare at each other daggers nor raise your voice too much. This noticeable behavior will make a child a tad bit dejected.

Start with good hygiene. The last thing you want to be worrying about when you're scoping for guys is whether or not your breath smells! Before you leave for the club, make sure to set aside plenty of time to get ready and feel good about yourself. Eat a good dinner or snack, drink plenty of water (no alcohol, as that could impair your preening judgment), brush your teeth, shower, shave, wash your face, and moisturize. 2. Do your makeup. The key to club makeup is to make your eyes and mouth stand out. The plus to this style is that you can go ahead and put on a little more makeup than you would during the day because the club will be dimly light (if at all) and it will be dark out. Go ahead and put on smokey eyeshadow, cat-eye liner, and those false lashes you've been waiting to try out. However, there is one problem with wearing so much makeup: if you dance or sweat, your makeup will run. 3. Do your hair. Leave it down! Curl it or straighten it, but the best club hairstyle is left down. You want to be able to run your hands through it while you're flirting! 4. Dress Well. Of course you want to look hot! At the same time, don't overdo it. Go for something that compliments your body and skin tone. 5. Keep necessities in a small purse. You don't want to be lugging your entire bathroom around in a giant duffel bag purse, so keep it light so you can carry it around the club with you. Necessities include: mints/gum/breath strips, hair ties, bobby pins/barrettes, your cellphone, your wallet, condoms, a compact mirror, and a tube of lipstick or lip gloss for touch-ups (depending on which you chose to wear). 6. Have a light drink.	It's completely optional, but it might help you loosen up a little and feel more confident. Drinking in excess is dangerous not only to your health, but to your reputation, so be careful how much you drink throughout the night. Remember, while you're at the bar, to position yourself so that you have a view of the club. This will make you appear open and social.

Firstly, use a digital recorder, Smartphone or tablet 2. Check your batteries - always use new batteries or charge the recorder. 3. Try and do the interview in a quiet environment, ideally in a small room - large rooms or halls can make the audio less clear. 4. Avoid bars, restaurants, being outside in the street and other noisy environments - background noise is a typist's worst nightmare and can lead to a less accurate transcript 5. Where possible, sit opposite your interviewee with a table between you and place the recorder equidistant from you both. 6. Although most recorders use Omni-directional microphones (meaning that they pick up sound from all directions), you'll notice microphone holes in the recorder so try and point them at both participants. 7. If possible do NOT hold the recorder or conceal it in a pocket or a bag - this severely reduces the audio quality to a point where it could be useless for transcription purposes. 8. If you do have to hold the recorder keep as still as possible. 9. If you think that one of you has a quieter voice, then place the recorder slightly closer to that person 10. Ensure that the person being interviewed is aware of the fact and avoid interrupting them. 11. If you do have to record the interview in a noisy environment try and get the recorder as close as possible to the voices that you want to record but avoid distortion.	.

Understand why sleep is important. Every person can agree that sleep is essential for your well-being. An average adult should get at least 8 hours of sleep at night, while teenagers should get 10 hours of it. Islam encourages a person to sleep in order to function well in the day and safely work since lack of sleep has many negative effects. The Prophet (SAW) told Ibn Amr, one of his companions, who was praying the whole night: “Offer prayers and also sleep at night, as your body has a right on you” * The Prophet (SAW) said, “If anyone of you feels drowsy while praying he should go to bed (sleep) till his slumber is over."" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 210] * Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (SAW), narrates of a woman from the tribe of Bani Asad, who was sitting with her. The Prophet (SAW) came and said, “Who is this?”Aisha replied, “She is so and so. She does not sleep at night because she is engaged in prayer."" The Prophet said disapprovingly, “Do (good) deeds which are within your capacity as Allah never gets tired of giving rewards till you get tired of doing good deeds” [Musnad Ahmed 25244] 2. Perform wudu to cleanse yourself. Wudu (ablution) is an Islamic ritual purification by washing certain body parts with water. It's usually done before performing Salah (prayer), but it's Sunnah to also perform it before sleeping. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said, ""Whenever you intend to go to bed, perform Wudu [like you do] for Salah (prayer)."" [Bukhari and Muslim] * Salman al-FarsiI narrated that he heard the Prophet (SAW) say: ""... Sleeping in a state of wudu is equal to standing up the entire night in prayers."" 3. Perform any normal sleep hygiene you do during the night. This includes dressing in more comfortable clothing (i.e wearing pajamas), washing your face, taking a warm bath, brushing your teeth, etc. Cleanliness and hygiene are critical in Islam. Abu Malik Al-Ash`ari reported that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: “Purity is half of iman (faith). * Brushing your teeth is highly encouraged to be done before falling asleep. Not only do dentists recommend it, but A’ishah reported that the Prophet (SAW) said, “The miswak (a twig used for tooth brushing) cleanses and purifies the mouth and pleases the Lord.” (An-Nasa’i and Ibn Khuzaimah; authenticated by Al-Albani) 4. Pray your Salah. Remembering Allah after a long, busy day brings comfort to many Muslims. Do not forget to perform Salatul-Isha, the last and fifth mandatory prayer of the day. Afterwards, you may pray two to twelve rak'at for Salatul Tahajjud. This prayer is known as the night prayer and is voluntary, Sunnah prayer. Unlike the five daily prayers, you are not in sin for skipping Tahajjud prayer, but it is highly encouraged because the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: ""In Paradise, there is a castle reserved for those who perform Tahajjud Salah."" * Some people prefer waking up before Fajr to perform the night prayer instead. This is recommended if you are usually exhausted by the end of the day. Praying this Salah before Fajr is called Salatul Witr. * A man asked the Prophet (SAW): ""How are the night prayers done?"" He said: “Two by two, then when you fear that dawn is about to break, pray Witr with one rak’ah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari. See al-Fath, 3/20. 5. Go to sleep right after Salah. Once you have performed your night prayers, you should go to bed right away so can wake up early in the morning. The Prophet (SAW) said, “One should not sleep before the night prayer, nor have discussions after it” [Sahih Al-Bukhari 574]."	.

Square your body to the hoop. To start practicing your jump shot, first, pick a comfortable shooting location (many find it easiest to shoot from the free throw line, the ""wings"" on either side of it, or closer to the hoop). Turn your body to face the hoop and plant your feet on the ground. Your head, shoulders, waist, and feet should be aligned towards the hoop so that you don't need to turn or twist at all to make your shot. * If you're just starting to learn how to make jump shots, begin by practicing on your own &mdash; in other words, don't have a friend ""cover"" you until you've made a few shots on your own or it'll be hard to make progress. 2. Get into a strong shooting stance. Believe it or not, the way you position your feet and lower body can have a big impact on your shooting accuracy even though you don't directly use them to shoot the ball. To get in a shooting stance, start with your feet together and move your non-shooting foot (the one opposite your dominant hand) away from the other until your feet are shoulder-width apart. Put a slight bend in your knees and hips to give yourself the flexibility you'll need to power your jump. * Shoulder-width foot positioning is important for your shooting speed and balance. Keep your feet to close together, and you'll struggle to maintain your balance as you make your shot; keep them too wide apart and you won't be able to give your jump enough power or react quickly to changes on the field. 3. Bring the ball into shooting position. Grip the ball in front of your upper chest/face using both hands. Spread your fingers and hold the ball with your fingertips to get as much control of the ball as possible. Position your shooting hand (the same one you write with) behind the ball so that the back of this hand faces your head. Position your non-shooting hand on the side of the ball so that the thumb on this hand points toward your forehead. * Your non-shooting hand is just as important for your shot as your shooting hand, so don't neglect it. Though it won't give your shot any power, it's largely responsible for the shot's control and balance. To see how important your non-shooting hand is, once you've gotten the hang of your jump shot, try shooting one-handed! 4. Get low, then jump! Increase the bend in your knees and hips until your stance looks like you're sitting down. Push with your hips and legs to launch yourself into the air. The lower you get, the more powerful your jump will be. One of the most common mistakes new players make is shooting from an erect standing position &mdash; in fact, you should only straighten up as you push off of the ground, not before. * For the greatest accuracy, as you get low, keep the elbow of your shooting arm close to your body. Ideally, this elbow should be pointing at the hoop. If your elbow moves out of alignment as you shoot, it can change the direction of the ball, so get in the habit of keeping it tucked in early. 5. Launch the ball. As you jump, bring the ball (which you should still be holding with proper hand placement) up in front of your body. Start to launch the ball up and toward the basket in an arc with your shooting arm only. Straighten your shooting arm elbow as you shoot, but keep it in line with your body. Your non-shooting hand should only be used for keeping the ball under control and thus should stay on the side of the ball where it won't affect the path of the shot. * Many coaches recommend looking at a certain part of the hoop as you make your shot for greater accuracy. Some recommend the back of the hoop (especially for players who tend to under-shoot), others recommend the front of the hoop (especially for players who tend to over-shoot), and others actually recommend visualizing the spot the ball will need to go through for a ""swish"". The last option requires the most concentration, but some claim that it achieves the best results. 6. Release and follow through. At the top of your jump, release the ball by turning your wrist downward. The ball should roll off of your shooting hand, touching your index finger last. Your shooting hand and arm should look roughly like you are reaching into a cookie jar on the top shelf at this point. After you release the ball, let your shooting arm come down naturally, bend in your knees and hips as you hit the ground, and get ready to catch the rebound if you miss! * Try to get in the habit of releasing the ball at the top of your jump. Though you can still make shots if you shoot earlier or later, this can make your shots tend to be jerky or inaccurate."	.
Slide_Into_Second_Base_in_Baseball.txt	Begin_Revision	0.807	## Steps	14	Also you ca n't slide with cleats high and exposed .	## Steps	31	However , you ca n't slide with cleats high and exposed .	<insert><However><1>|||<replace><Also><1><,><2>	True	Steps  1. The first technique you should work on is your first step or jump. A quick and well timed quick first step can make the difference in being safe or out. There are many ways to work on quickness. Jumping exercises, developing proper balance, and learning to use the balls and toes of your feet is the basis of developing proper technique. Also sprinting short distances will help you to develop a quicker first step. Have a friend time you with a stop watch and work on different set up's and weight transfers to speed up your first step. FYI, you don't want to have too much of a lean to 2nd base that endangers you getting back to first on a quick throw from the pitcher to first. 2. The next important item is learn to break down pitchers wind ups. Most pitchers have tells that will let you know where the ball is going. The leg kick is a key area to study when your teammate is batting. If you watch him enough you will get a feel for what his intentions are on the mound. Try to get the pitcher to throw to first to see how long it takes the throw to get there. Start with a short lead and work it to figure out how far you can lead before it's to dangerous of a lead. This can also help you take away his focus on the batter and force him into mistakes on pitches (wild pitches and walks). 3. Never look at the catcher. Watch the shortstop or second baseman (whomever is covering the base) to take your que on where and how to slide. If it's a straight steal then if he is towards the outfield you want to make your approach to the inside or pitchers side of the bag. If he settle on the inside or pitchers side of bag try sliding to the outfield side. If you are in a league that allow head first it's more advantageous and allows a wider area to slide. If head first isn't allowed the you need to work on hooking the leg on the bag. You can use your arm and hand but it will be slower. 4. Finally work on your sliding technique! Nothing else matters if you can't master sliding. 5. If your intent is to break up a double play then the goal is to keep the shortstop or second baseman from either making the throw or making a strong or accurate throw. The goal is to get the second baseman uncomfortable and either get him throwing while jumping or trying t throw while dodging you. As long as you can legitimately touch the bag you can slide anywhere the thrower is located.	Keep them lower than the thrower's knee and don't try to hit him intentionally. You will only get called on it by the ump if it's malicious.

Unsatisfactory Exam Preparation:Studying is not just reading for information, it is reading for comprehension. Many times children fail in planning ahead and time management. For instance, you are a student of the semester system. You have six months of preparation. You must make a plan on how to complete the course in the available time given to you while dividing your total time between each subject. 2. Try to make a time table putting aside time for each subject on daily basis. Many times, children give unreasonable excuses related to exam failure. These could be anything from, “My roommate didn't set the alarm clock and I was not given enough time to get read,” to “I did not know what chapters to read for the exam.” Some other illogical excuses could be, “My school bag got stolen several days ago and I lost all my notes,” or ”I thought our teacher would not ask any questions from the last two chapters."" 3. Always avoid selective studying. Remember, an exam is given over an entire course not merely selected areas of your course. 4. Harmful Study habits:Many times children play music or turn on the TV while studying. It distracts the child from focusing on the material at hand. Many children like group studying, but make sure it doesn't morph into a gossip session. A bad environment can mean an uncomfortable chair, desk, or room temperature. This can make for an unproductive study session. 5. Eating too much food while studying can distract children. It can also take too much time away from their task."	.

Take your game to the next level by teaching your friends or by playing online. There is little satisfaction to be garnered from shooting when you were passed the ace, king and queen of hearts. 2. Wait for the right hand. Good hands tend to be those with many high cards (especially hearts), or those that include most of a suit (including the few highest cards). It is only possible to shoot the moon on some hands. Always be on the lookout for the stoppers. If you have all the diamonds but the king, its fall marks your shot. If it's still hanging around somewhere after your ace of diamonds has been played, you have no chance. 3. When passing cards, try to get rid of your lowest cards in your least abundant suits. If you have several hearts, but not the highest, hold on to all of them--you will very likely get a few high hearts passed to you. If not, simply wait for another hand. Note: This is only true against newbies. Good players will typically cover their passes by passing a heart that they know they can beat. When playing against people who know what they're doing, don't go all out on the pass, e.g., keep a couple out cards (like a two or three of some suit) in case a heart falls early or your opponent covers. Even good players will occasionally receive desperate hands that they can't cover with. If you are dealt a strong hand that can shoot or duck (having a long suit with both high and low cards) with only one, two or even three hearts, try passing them all. If the incoming pass is covered you haven't lost much.	Your opponents will take it and you will have a void heart suit. If your opponents didn't take it, laugh in their faces and proceed with the shot.

If they are comfortable in the water and are able to do all of the previous exercises, then you can move on to some more advanced swimming techniques. 2. Teach your child to breathe while swimming. This is a complicated technique that may take some time. * To start, have your child sit on the steps. Then teach him to turn his head to the right and take a breath at regular intervals. * After he gets used to this motion, hold him in the water with his stomach down. Have him dip his face in the water and do the same motion that he did on the stairs: look to the right and take a breath at regular intervals. * Have him try this motion while swimming independently, either with or without a life vest. 3. Teach your child to float. He should have this skill before he starts swimming without a floatation device. * Rotate your child onto his back. Continue supporting his head and shoulders as he gets into position. * Have him keep his legs out in front of him and his arms at his sides. His neck should also be tilted back slightly. * Have him take a deep breath and hold it. * Gradually let go. Stay close enough so you can go back to supporting his head if he starts to sink. * Remember to keep reassuring him that you're there and you won't let him sink. 4. Let your child swim to the other side of the pool.	If not, it is fine to do with a life vest on.

Discover your cat's favorite treat. While your cat may like a variety of treats, you should find the one that motivates her the most. The best way to do this is to wait until your cat is hungry and place small amounts (about a teaspoon) of different treats into separate bowls. Place the bowls side by side and watch carefully to see which she pays the most attention to and eats the fastest. You might even notice her paying more attention to you when you prepare her favorite treat. * Try lots of different foods, including ham, steak, tuna, freeze dried prawns, cubes of cheese, and commercial cat treats. 2. Keep the treats nearby. Since you'll be training several times a day (at least twice daily) over the weeks to come, have a ready supply of the treats. You may want to keep them in a treat pouch or small plastic container. This way, you can keep the treats on you so you'll be ready for any impromptu training opportunities that come up. * If your cat has a medical condition, especially anything gastro-intestinal or allergy related, check with your veterinarian to make sure the chosen treat is suitable for your pet. 3. Realize that teaching is a multi-step process. Once you've found what motivates your cat, you may think you're ready to train your cat to stay.	This training device will help her associate the click-clack sound of the clicker with a treat or reward.

Teach your cat to sit. Wait until the cat is walking around, rather than just sitting anyway. Get her attention by showing her a treat and when she approaches hold the treat just in front of her nose. Sweep it backwards in an arc over her head and as she follows the treat her bottom will drop to the ground. The instant her bottom touches the ground, mark the action with a click-clack. At the same time, firmly say ""sit"" and then give her a reward. * Spend several 5 minutes session teaching her this, until she is sitting on command. * Don't forget you can train whenever you are in the same room as your cat. You don't need to wait for a formal training session. 2. Teach your cat to stay. Get your cat to sit, then take one step away from her. If she doesn't move, click-clack (to mark the stay behavior) and say ""stay."" If she follows the command, immediately give her a treat. Repeat this several times and then end the session by giving her lots of praise. * If your cat loses concentration and wanders off, end the session. Don't force her to train. 3. Challenge your cat. Once your cat has shown she can follow the command to stay, work on gradually extending the physical distance between you. Start by taking two steps away, and once she is staying regularly, you can increase it to three, four, or more. * Take it slowly, and if the cat loses focus and gets up, then retrace your steps on the next session. 4. Distract and test your cat. Ask your cat to stay while you throw a toy as a distraction. If she has learned to stay, she won't chase after the toy."	Seeing you throw the toy and command her to stay will help your cat better understand what you're asking her do to by staying.

Capture what the technology or business process does. The use case explains the goal of the technology or process, not how the technology functions. In other words, a use case about logging in to software does not include how the code must be written or how the technological components are connected. It simply focuses on what the user needs to do and how the software responds. * Get the level of detail right. For example, if writing a use case about implementing technology, excluding details about how the software responds to users is a business process description, not a use case. * Alternatively, adding too much detail about how the software functions reads more like system design implementation than a use case. 2. Keep the use case primarily textual. Use cases do not need to include complex flow charts or visual diagrams that explain the process. Simple flow charts, sequence charts or Petri nets can be used to clarify information.	The style of writing should be very simple so that others can read and comprehend it without specific training.

The first thing to do is to think of a topic. If your teacher already provided the topic for you, you're all set and you can skip onto the next step if you want. But if your teacher hasn't, then you need to think of one. An excellent topic should draw people's attention to read the article just by reading the title/topic. A couple interesting ideas are: Money isn't as Important; Looks Don't Matter; What Soda Can Do Besides Increase Weight (this is a really interesting topic, and, yes, it's true that soda has a good side) 2. After thinking of the topic, your next task is to write an introduction. Most people think that writing the introduction is the toughest part of the essay, but, really, the introduction is one the easiest parts. All you do is write a topic sentence, and follow-up with a couple interesting facts about it. Just a couple sentences (3-5) should complete your introduction. 3. The next paragraphs after the introduction should explain (detail/reason) the introduction. For example, your introduction is: ""Everyone should help animals. If you ponder about this topic, we humans are extremely spoiled compared to the creatures, from colossal to puny. By joining hands and using our continuous-increasing technology, together we can help the animals at every chance we can, one creature at a time."", then your next paragraphs should be saying how you can help the creatures. 4. Ah...The hardest part of the essay... The conclusion! I'd be lying if I told you I only spend 5 minutes on the conclusion. In fact, I take a couple hours thinking of how to write it. I know how to write it, but organizing my thoughts is challenging."	In other words, your conclusion should contain bits of your other paragraphs, and the last sentence should be your main point.

Understand that treatment isn't always necessary. Not all cases of feline acne need treatment. If the cat has only one or two comedones (black spots) and they do not irritate him, then they can be left alone. * However, if the cat has a history of those spots becoming infected and the condition deteriorating, then it is best to pursue treatment. 2. Cleanse non-infected spots with surgical spirit or chlorhexidine. If the cat has spots but they are not infected, then topical treatment with a cleansing agent or surgical spirit will suffice. To apply the latter, moisten a cotton wool ball with surgical spirit and wipe the chin twice a day until the spots have disappeared. * Chlorhexidine is suitable for use in cats because it is not toxic to them and does not sting. Chlorhexidine comes as a concentrated pink, soapy liquid. To use, dilute the neat chlorhexidine well in water, using around 5ml of chlorhexidine to 100ml of water, to make a pale pink translucent solution. * Moisten a cotton wool ball with this solution and wipe it over the cat's chin twice daily. Chlorhexidine helps to cleanse the skin of bacteria and make it less likely that bacteria will colonize the hair follicles. 3. Use a follicle flushing shampoo. Pet shampoos containing benzyl peroxide are useful to treat feline acne. This is because the benzyl peroxide penetrates into the follicles and has a deep cleansing action. * This will remove excess waxy grease which might otherwise accumulate and cause spots. The shampoo should be used well diluted, and can be used as a local treatment rather than washing the whole cat. * To treat the chin, wet the area with damp cotton wool and then add a drop of benzyl peroxide shampoo to the damp cotton wool and rub it on the chin. Leave it to dry in for 5 minutes, and then rinse well using a clean flannel soaked in water. * Repeat this morning and evening. If redness or soreness of the skin develops, stop the treatment until the skin heals. Then start again but use less shampoo. 4. Apply a hot compress to the cat's skin. Feline acne is usually not painful, but if the spots become swollen this can cause irritation and if the cat scratches the spot it may become infected. It is therefore a good idea to bring the spots to a head so that they burst and relieve the pressure on the follicles. Hot compresses can help with this. * A hot compress is simply a ball of cotton wool soaked in moderately warm salt water. To make this, boil the kettle and then add a teaspoon of salt to a pint of the boiled water . Allow the solution to cool to just above body temperature. * Soak the cotton wool in the warm water, squeeze out the excess moisture and then hold the damp cotton wool to the cat's chin. Try to keep it there for around 5 minutes. Repeat this 2 to 3 times a day until the spots burst or subside. 5. Know that oral antibiotics will usually be necessary to clear infected acne. If secondary infection of the spots occurs, cleaning the area with salt water or cleansing shampoo will help control the problem but they will not solve it. As a result, it is likely that oral antibiotics will be necessary. * Topical treatments such as antibiotic gels or creams are not typically used to treat feline acne because they have the potential to clog the follicles. * Instead, oral antibiotics such as cephalexin, clindamycin, and clavulanate-potentiated amoxicillin are used to kill bacterial on the surface of the skin. These are given by mouth at the recommended dose until the spots have cleared and then the course is extended for at least another week. 6. Give the cat antibiotics according to the vet's instructions.Depended on which oral antibiotic your vet prescribes, you will need to give the medication to you cat according to specific instructions. Some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for feline acne include: * Cephalexin: This is a first generation cephalosporin antibiotic from the beta-lactam group. This group of antibiotics kill bacteria by inhibiting proper formation of the bacterial cell wall and thus making it osmotically unstable. The dose is 30-50mg/cat by mouth twice daily.	This is best given with food if the cat has a sensitive stomach and is likely to vomit.

The dose of clindamycin in the cat is 5-10mg/kg twice a day, or the dose can be combined and given once a day.	This antibiotic is more effective if given on an empty stomach.

They will use their feet to propel themselves down the road, and eventually take their feet off the road when they are ready to balance. Then replace the pedals and let them ride normally. * Alternatively, depending on the age of your child, buy a pre-bike. This is a light weight two wheeler but without the complication of pedals etc. The child learns to balance, scoot and then glide along, potentailly from a very young age. When you child is ready you can then introduce a bike with pedals. *	.

Try using vinegar. Though it isn't clear how this method works, some sources swear by it. First, take a cold shower. Next, fill a spray bottle with vinegar and gently mist the burnt skin. Let the vinegar sit for about an hour. After, rinse it off or take another cold shower. The smell can be unpleasant for the hour waiting period, but your sunburn should be much less likely to peel. * Most types of vinegar should work, but according to some sources, apple cider vinegar works best. Avoid balsamic vinegar &mdash; the added sugar and coloring make it a bad choice. 2. Try a tea bath. According to some, the tannic acids in black tea can soothe burn skin and prevent peeling. To do this, first boil a pot of water. Steep five or six tea bags in the hot water for about five to ten minutes. Let the tea cool to room temperature (cool it in the fridge to reduce your wait time). When it's cool, apply it to the burnt area with a rag or spray bottle and let it sit for half an hour. Alternatively, just hold one of the wet tea bags against the skin. * Most sources recommend a black tea (like earl grey) for this. 3. Use whole milk. The fat in dairy products can help moisturize burnt skin, reducing pain and preventing peeling. Whole milk is usually the cheapest, most convenient way to get this benefit. Try soaking a rag in whole milk and holding it against your burn in 20 minute intervals as a cold compress. Alternatively, add whole milk to a cool bath and let yourself soak. * Don't use low- or non-fat milk for this. Without the fat, the milk loses much of its moisturizing power. * Whole-fat plain Greek yogurt also gives the same effect when used as a lotion. Don't use sugary sweetened yogurts, which can get sticky. 4. Try making a potato paste. The starch inside potatoes contains lots of water, so laying it against the skin is a great way to re-moisturize skin that's dried out from a sunburn. Try using a grater to turn a cool potato into a starchy paste, then rubbing this against the skin and letting it sit. Wash off with cold water after 20 minutes. * You can also use a food processor to make your paste. If you do, cut your potato into small pieces first. Trying to grind up a whole potato at once can be too much for some processors. 5. Use cucumber slices. Cucumbers cool and moisturize irritated skin just like potatoes. Simply cut thin slices from a refrigerated cucumber and lay them across the affected area. The wider the cucumber, the better. * If you're having a hard time getting the cucumber slices to stick, try moistening your skin with a little oil or lotion, using like glue. 6. Use coconut oil. While many natural oils will moisturize and soothe dry skin just like commercial lotions, coconut oil is an especially good choice. In addition to providing moisture and giving burnt skin a healthy glow, it also gently exfoliates, removing dead skin and promoting healing. * Coconut oil is available in solid blocks from many health food stores and specialty grocers. It will liquify from the heat of your hands. 7. Make an oatmeal bath.	Try running a cool bath and mixing in two to three cups of plain (unsweetened) rolled oats. Soak in the bath for 20 minutes before rinsing off or proceeding to one of the other treatments.

Learn about the structure of the liver. Its structure is unusual in the sense that it has dual blood supply from two different sources. One of them is through the hepatic artery that supplies blood that is rich in oxygen to the liver tissue. The other blood source is from the portal vein which originates in the digestive system in its various parts. 2. Study the role of the blood supply to the liver. This blood supply to the liver carries blood that is rich with nutrients and small molecules such as amino acids and glucose molecules. This blood supply can also bring to the liver tissue other compounds that can be toxic to the liver cells. This can include for example bacteria and other pathogens that can enter the blood stream to reach eventually the liver sinuses. 3. Study the role of the liver's immune cells. The liver has special type of immune cells that can neutralize pathogens and bacterial forms. These cells are special type of macrophages that help in fighting pathogens and keep the body in healthy condition. The liver in humans plays a major part in the metabolic reactions inside the body. For example, the liver is the site of energy production for the body. The glycolytic pathway and the Krebs cycle both occur in the liver cells that are called hepatocytes. * These two processes of energy production are crucial for the sustaining of life of the individual. Metabolic reactions for the production of energy rich molecules in the form of ATP molecules are very important processes that have been studied extensively and their detailed reactions are clear and understood. The other important function of the liver is the synthesis of clotting factors for the blood. Clotting factors in humans are a group of proteins that have physiological effect to cause blood clotting. * These clotting factors are very important for the body in order to prevent bleeding disorders in the individuals. In the case of liver failure the capacity of the liver to synthesize these proteins is impaired. If severe enough this can lead to bleeding disorders in affected individuals. 4. Learn about how humans metabolize fatty acids. Another important function of the liver in humans is the metabolism of fatty acids. This process is especially important in diabetic patients who rely on the metabolism of fatty acids for their generation of energetic molecules of ATP.	.

Purchase a quality scale within your budget. There are a variety of bathroom and home scales that you can purchase. Some will be relatively inexpensive, where others will cost a significant amount more. * Choose a quality scale that still fits in with your budget. You want a scale that will last for several years and be able to maintain its calibration. In addition, digital scales are thought to be superior to mechanical scales as these are fragile and more inaccurate. * Many quality digital scales are accurate within 1 pound anywhere between 97-100% of the time. Older-model spring and dial scales may be accurate as little as 13% of the time. * You may even want to consider a newer-model digital scales which can measure body fat and even track weight loss. 2. Place the scale on a hard, flat surface. When you're weighing yourself, you want to make sure that your results are as accurate as possible. Put your scale on the appropriate surface to help with it's accuracy. * Most scales will come with directions that will say where the best place is to put your scale. Make sure to follow the manufacturers advice. * Placing your scale on carpet can cause the scale to read your weight as 10% heavier! The bathroom or kitchen is usually a good place for an at-home scale. * Make sure the scale is lying level. A scale that tilts or sits unevenly will not read your weight accurately. 3. Calibrate the scale. Over time, your scale may lose it's accuracy. It's normal after many times of weighing or being moved around. Check it regularly to make sure the results you're receiving are accurate. * Check your scale’s accuracy by putting an item with a reliable known weight (like a dumbbell or a bag of flour or sugar) on it. Check the reading you get and make any adjustments as needed. * Refer to your owner’s manual to calibrate your scale regularly. * Many digital scales always have a ""calibration feature"" which can help you accurately calibrate your scale. 4. Step onto the scale. Depending on which scale you purchase or have at home, there might be a slightly different way to step on the scale to get your reading. * With analog scales, you can usually just step on and wait until the dial stops spinning and read your result. * However, if you own a digital scale, you may have to “prime” your scale before hopping on. Some require you to tap it to ""wake it up"" and then step on before it gives you a reading. Always refer to your owner’s manual for proper weighing procedures. * If you're using a mechanical scale, you'll need to slide the large weight along the bottom beam. The large weight has larger scale increments than the small weight (often 10-25 pounds). Then slide the small weight along the top beam. Once you’ve got the large weight in the general vicinity of your weight, use the small weight to zone in on the precise measurement. 5. Weigh yourself weekly. Research suggests that weighing yourself every day may help contribute to weight loss and even long-term weight maintenance. * Weigh yourself at the same time every day (preferably in the morning) for the best results. In addition, try to be wearing the same thing whenever you weigh in for an accurate trend. * Weigh yourself in the morning for best results. Weigh in after you’ve emptied your bladder and before you’ve had breakfast to eliminate as many variables as possible. * Avoid weighing yourself daily. It's normal to have day to day fluctuations in weight and this method doesn't give you an accurate indicator of a weight trend. This may become discouraging if you notice unwanted weight fluctuations. 6. Use a chart to track your progress. If you're interested in gaining or losing weight, tracking your weight over time can help you meet your goal. * If ink and paper are your thing, you can make a poster to track your numbers."	.

Determine the purpose of your essay. This will have an impact on whom you interview and how you will write it after conducting the interview. * If your essay is to be a factual piece, you'll want to interview someone who has expertise in the subject matter you'll be addressing. If your paper is about a science topic, you'll want to interview a scientist in that field. If your paper is about a period of history, you'll want to interview either a historian or someone who's lived through that period of history. * If you plan to make your essay an opinion piece, you'll likely want to interview someone who has a strong opinion about the topic covered in your essay who can express it well, in addition to having credentials in the area you plan to write about. * If your piece will have a narrow perspective, you'll need to interview only one or two people. If your piece will present a general consensus, you'll need to interview more people, probably with varying expertise and credentials. 2. Decide what format your interview essay will have. Interview essays can be in one of several formats: * Narrative format. This form allows paraphrasing of some information the interviewee says, along with direct quotes for the material you most want to emphasize. * Conversational format. This is a looser format than the formal writing style required for most essays. You can address the reader directly and use both first and second person. * Question-and-answer format. This form presents your questions to the interviewee, followed by the interviewee's responses. These are always direct quotes, although you may insert explanatory material in parentheses and substitutions, such as a person's name in place of a personal pronoun, in brackets. This format is best suited for essays with only a single interviewee or a closely related group, such as spouses or the core cast of a TV show. 3. Arrange the interview(s). You'll need to contact the interviewee or his or her representative to arrange a time and place to conduct the interview. You'll also need permission to record the interview with either audio or video equipment, or to take photographs. Be sure the person you contact knows who you are and why you want to interview him or her. * Choose a quiet place with few distractions for your interview site. A library, restaurant, or campus location if you're doing this for a college writing class would be suitable. * You may want to get the interviewee's consent to use his or her comments in your essay in writing, as well as permission to record those comments during the interview. * It's helpful to have a backup interviewee in case the person you plan to interview can't make it. * Be on time at the place you've agreed to meet for the interview. 4. Research your interview subject. Read works about your subject and works written by your subject, both in print and online, including the person's official website, if there is one.	The more you know about both, the more intelligent questions you can ask.
Treat_a_Lazy_Eye.txt	Begin_Revision	0.951	## Steps	1333	Though the prognosis is typically best for young lazy eye sufferers , recent experimental procedures have shown promise for adult sufferers .	### Treating Minor Cases of Lazy Eye	1375	Although the prognosis is typically best for young lazy eye sufferers , recent experimental procedures have shown promise for adult sufferers .	<replace><Though><1><Although><1>	True	"Steps  1. Treat the condition with corrective eyewear. Special glasses are commonly prescribed to improve the focus of of the eyes and correct misalignment. For certain cases of lazy eye, especially when nearsightedness, farsightedness, and/or astigmatism contribute to the condition, glasses can fix the problem entirely. In other cases, glasses may be used in conjunction with other treatments to fix lazy eye. Talk to your doctor or optometrist if you are interested in obtaining glasses for your lazy eye. * In children of a sufficient age, contact lenses may sometimes be used instead of glasses. * Note that, initially, people with lazy eye may find it more difficult to see when wearing their glasses. This is because they have become accustomed to their impaired vision and need time to gradually adjust to ""normal"" vision. 2. Wear an eye patch. For certain cases of lazy eye involving impaired vision in one eye and normal vision in the other eye, patching or covering the ""good"" eye may be required. Forcing the lazy eye sufferer to use his or her ""bad"" eye to see gradually strengthens the vision in that eye. Patches are most effective in patients younger than the age of 7 or 8. The patch is typically worn between 3 and 6 hours per day for a period of time ranging from a few weeks to as long as a year. * A doctor may recommend that, while wearing a patch, the lazy eye sufferer concentrate on performing activities like reading, schoolwork, and other activities that force him or her to focus on up-close objects. * Patches may be used in conjunction with corrective eyewear. 3. Use a prescribed eye medication. Medication— usually in the form of atropine eye drops —may be used to blur the vision of the good eye in order to force the weaker one to work. This treatment works according to the same principle as a patch treatment works by - forcing the ""bad"" eye to see gradually strengthens its vision. * Eye medication can be a good choice for children who are reluctant to wear an eye patch (and vice versa). However, eye drops may not be effective when the ""good"" eye is nearsighted. * Atropine eye drops are sometimes associated with minor side effects, including: * Eye irritation * Reddening of surrounding skin * Headaches 4. Undergo a surgical procedure. Surgery may be performed on the eye muscles to straighten the eyes if non-surgical means are unsuccessful. Surgery can also help in the treatment of amblyopia if the condition is caused by a cataract. Surgery may be accompanied with the use of an eye patch, eye medication, or glasses, or, if it produces good results, may be sufficient on its own. * Eye exercises may be recommended either before or after surgery to correct faulty visual habits and to teach normal, comfortable use of the eyes. 5. For all treatment options, begin as early as possible. Lazy eyes are almost always treatable, and, in most cases, a proper treatment regimen will give marked improvements within a few weeks to a few months. However, results are generally best when treatment is begun when the sufferer is as young as possible. For the best chance of catching a case of lazy eye early, ensure that your child receives regular eye exams while he or she is young - some doctors recommend exams at 6 months, three years, and then every two years after that. *"	Talk to your doctor or optometrist to learn the latest treatment options available to you.

Let go of your defensiveness. If you want to really reflect and understand yourself better, you're going to need to think about parts of yourself that you really don't like and admit to some things you might not want to admit to. You'll be naturally defensive about admitting these kinds of things to yourself, but if you're really going to understand how you work, then you're going to need to let go of that defensiveness. Even if you don't let those barriers down for other people, you at least have to let them down for yourself. * Becoming less defensive about your weaknesses can also mean opening yourself up to getting help from other people and making amends for past mistakes. If you're more open to discussion, criticism, and change, then other people can really help you understand and improve yourself. 2. Be honest with yourself. We lie to ourselves a lot more than we'd like to think about sometimes. We'll help ourselves to think that we made some questionable choices for noble or logical reasons, even when we were really just being vindictive or lazy. But hiding from the real reason behind our motives doesn't help us change and develop into better people. Remember: there's no point in lying to yourself. Even if you discover truths about yourself that you really don't like, this only give you the opportunity to take those problems head on instead of just pretending like they don't exist. 3. Listen to what others say to and about you. Sometimes, especially when we do bad things, others will try to warn us against those behaviors. We also have a tendency not to listen. Sometimes this is good, because lots of people will say things about you just because they want to hurt you and their comment will have no basis in fact. But sometimes what they say is a good, outsider’s analysis of how you behave. Think about what people have said in the past and ask for some new opinions about your behavior. * For example, your sister might notice that you tend to exaggerate.	.

That is your whole number. center * For instance, if the 0 on the Vernier scale didn’t go past any full inch divisions (so it lies between 0 and 1 on the main scale), your whole number is 0 inches. 3. Determine the first decimal place. Use the tenth-of-an-inch divisions on the main scale to determine this number. Comparing the 0 on the Vernier scale to the main scale, look at how many full tenth-of-an-inch divisions the Vernier scale 0 has gone passed on the main scale. center * The 0 on the Vernier scale hasn’t gone past any full inch divisions, but it has passed 8 tenth-of-an-inch divisions (so it lies between 8 and 9 tenths), so your number so far is 0.8 inches. 4. Figure out the rough estimate of your second decimal place. Compare the 0 on the Vernier scale with the main scale again, and this time count how many hundredth-of-an-inch divisions the 0 has passed since the last full tenth-of-an-inch divisions division. Then, multiply that by how much each division represents (such as 0.025, 0.02, or 0.05). center * The 0 on the Vernier scale has passed 3 full inch divisions, past 6 full tenth-of-an-inch divisions, and past 2 hundredth-of-an-inch divisions after the 6-tenths-of-an-inch mark. If, for instance, your Vernier caliper has three divisions between each tenth-of-an-inch (so each one represents 0.025), you know your second decimal place will start at 0.05 (the rough estimate). At the moment you have a rough estimate of 0.85 inches. 5. Determine your second decimal and third decimal place. Now you are going to use the Vernier scale to determine a more precise measurement for the second and third decimal place. Compare the full Vernier scale (not just the 0) with the main scale, and find the first place where a line on the Vernier scale matches perfectly with a line on the main scale. Once you’ve found it, count how many lines in the match is on the Vernier scale. Lines 1 to 9 represent 0.001 to 0.009, lines 10 to 19 represent 0.010 to 0.019, etc. center *	.

Suboxone is similar and has the same effect. The drug is categorized as a “partial opiate agonist"". In other words, it is sort of a half opiate which can be substituted for a narcotic to allow a generally remarkably tolerable detoxification. The process usually takes 14 days as an outpatient, but can be shortened or extended to 21 days to meet the needs of the client. Patients on methadone may need longer on buprenorphine in order to cover the long lasting withdrawal syndrome associated with methadone. Suboxone kills the craving and mimics the methadone or other painkiller so that one can get through the withdrawal easier and faster than graduated withdrawal. In just 21 days a person can be clean of the effects. An alternative is to count off over a long time - 2 to 3 years - in small frequent drops of 1 milligram or less. If done slowly enough, withdrawal symptoms do not happen. A rule of thumb is 1 mg every (200 / current dose in mg) days. that is, at 100 mg per day, drop 1 mg every 2 days; at 70 mg, every 3 days; at 50 mg every 4 days... (Do the calculation at every dose level.) Below about 10 mg, drop in 0.5 mg steps fortnightly, below 5 mg 0.25 mg fortnightly. This allows the neuro-adaptation to opiates to reverse slowly back to normal. If withdrawal symptoms occur, slow the reduction rate even further. Do not jump off until below ONE mg. Preferably count down to 0.25 mg. Do not use any other drugs. The end of the taper is the critical part. Do it right, and do it once! Another alternative for the highly motivated individual is to change your dosing to every 12 hours. That way you can titrate the dose down more precisely and rapidly."	"This is impossible to do if you change your dose a week or two at a time with the clinic. You will always be afraid to push yourself if you know you may be miserable for a week or two if you over-do-it. Alternatively, it is more practical to push yourself by lowering the am dose aggressively with the peace of mind of having a rescue dose (which you also taper as tolerated). As long as your 24 hour total is being tapered, you are making progress. You will also have a visual reward for your discipline, in the form of extra tablets at the end of a week / two. Furthermore, as you titrate the methadone down more precisely, you will start to understand that there is no real temptation to take large doses of leftover methadone in pursuit of a ""high."" It sounds weird but you start to realize the smallest amount of methadone you need to not have withdrawal symptoms. This method can get you from 100mg/day to 10mg/day in 2-3 months. You will have ups and downs, but if you are motivated to get your dose down, this is one way of doing it. I came up with this method because I was not pushing myself for fear of lowering the dose for 7 days at a time. Besides, it takes two or three days for a dose change to really catch up with you (especially if you are taking all your methadone at one time like most clinics direct you to). The cons of this approach are that you must figure out how to manage the monitored dose. Usually, if you are passing your ua's and in good standing with the clinic, you can just drink a portion of the monitored dose and quickly toss the cup aside. As long as it either goes in your mouth or the trash, you should be okay. I realize this method is not for everybody. However, imagine if you were trying to get into shape. Or even consider the basic tenets of 12 step recovery. The point is, set a goal for today. Then, when tomorrow comes, make a goal for tomorrow. Addicts are afraid to commit to even a day of sobriety at a time, much less a week or two of dope sickness with no rescue medication. You must take responsibility for your leftover medication. The addict in you will want to hoard the extra methadone for a ""later day."" That is when you know you are ready to ""jump off,"" as stated above. This is when you drop your clinic dose, keep a minimal amount of rescue medication, and flush the rest. The clinic may not let you drop as quickly as you want, so factor this in. If I hadn't done it this way, there is no way I could have dropped my dose as quickly and comfortably. Just having some ""flexibility"" of a rescue dose actually facilitated a rate of dose reduction that I couldn't have achieved had I lowered my clinic dose a week at a time."

Inspect the the bolts or pins that adjust the crutch length, they must be in good condtion when using a used crutches. All crutches must have the rubber tips at the bottom. 2. Adjust the distance from the top of the crutches to where you rest your palms on. Do not adjust it so far that your elbows are completely straightened - you will not have control of the crutches. Do not have it so close that your elbows are bent and in a weak position. Make the adjustment where you have a slight bend at the elbows. Having your arms totally straightened could cause injury, avoid that position. You must be ready for the unexpected. When your arms are straight they can only shorten, but with a slight bend at the elbows, your arms can extend a bit and shorten. With the slight bend your arms are still in a very strong position. This adjustment will be permanent, and you must fine tune it to the ideal position. 3. Adjust the length of the crutches.	Choose crutches that are sturdy and easily adjustable.

Outline your article. * Articles should be well written, engaging, and informative. They should present a new angle on a specific topic. A good hook in the beginning along with useful information will make people want to continue reading it. Your article should be useful, entertaining, or otherwise valuable. * A well-written article with good content will attract more traffic, meaning many readers visit your site. This makes your article more attractive to link marketers (people that link their sites to yours) and increases the likelihood of advertisers wanting to use your page for their advertisements. * Google search engine provides a great weight on the title of articles and blogs. That is why it is crucial that the keyword phrase is present on the title as an important part of an effective SEO content. 2. Make a list of key phrases and keywords for your article. This is important so that your publisher can include it in the metadata of the page, which is part of the HTML code. * It will be very helpful for the readers and Google ranking if the article is divided with subheadings, as readers appreciate it more when they can read an article with ease. As an important reminder, most people who browse the sites are only skim-reading on the internet. That is why with a subheading they are likely to finish the article and stay on the page for a longer period. * Keywords and key phrases are words or phrases that people would use to search for information on the topic which you are about to write. For example, key phrases for an article on moving could be ""packing and moving"" or ""loading a moving truck,"" while keywords could be ""moving,"" ""relocation,"" or ""relocating."" * Key phrases and keywords are registered by ""spiders,"" which are scripts that search engines send out to every page on the Internet. Spiders ""crawl"" across web pages and websites and analyze them for content and quality of content. One way they do this is by registering the keywords and key phrases to determine the subject of a page; but they also detect how often each keyword or phrases are used, whether a page is grammatically correct, and what types of inbound and outbound hyperlinks there are. Hyperlinks are links to other pages that are somehow relevant to your topic. 3. Write your article. * Make sure it's grammatically correct with no spelling mistakes. * Give your article a title. * Break it up into short paragraphs with subheaders. * Use the most important keywords and key phrases as early in the article as possible, preferably in the first sentence, and in the first paragraph. * Do not overuse keywords or key phrases. Intersperse them naturally throughout the text in the natural reading rhythm of the article. The recommended keyword density is 1-3% . * Include the most important keywords and key phrases in titles and subheaders. * If it makes sense in the text, put keywords and key phrases in bold or italics. * As too many keywords are present on the content, Google search engine will assume that the keyword are stuffing. Do not make a rookie mistake and place those keyword phrases on the 155 - 200 words *"	To break the redundancy, try starting the article through a question. As the keyword is already inserted in the sentence, all you have to do is BOLD it. This will emphasize the keyword and it will make a huge effect on the Google algorithm as it scanned the article.

Cut out a few calories from your diet. Although adding regular walks or even power walks to your weekly routine can help support weight loss, modifying your diet is another important part of weight loss. * An easy way to help speed up weight loss is by cutting out calories from your day. Restricting your intake by about 500 calories each day can result in about a 1–2 pound weight loss each week alone. * To get started, begin by keeping a food journal of a typical day of eating. Note all your meals, snacks and beverages that your normally consume. Use an online food calorie counter to get an estimate of how many calories you eat on a regular day. * Subtract 500 calories from this number and set yourself a new goal. Following this can help you lose weight as well. 2. Go for lean protein sources. When you're watching calories and your waistline, it's important to choose foods that will help support your weight loss efforts. * Lean protein is naturally lower in calories and will help support your weight loss. Include a 3–4 oz serving of lean protein at each meal to help meet your daily goals. * Lean protein sources to include: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, tofu, legumes, pork and seafood. 3. Fill up on fruits and vegetables. Like leaner cuts of protein, fruits and vegetables are low calories and can help you lose weight and stick to a lower calories diet. * Fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories. However, they're also very high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. * These foods help keep you feeling more full (with less calories) by adding some bulk to your meals. * In addition to having a source of lean protein at each meal, make sure you include one to two servings of fruits and vegetables. Measure out 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of leafy salad greens or 1/2 cup of fruit. 4. Choose whole grains. Another food group that can help keep you feeling satisfied on a lower calorie diet are whole grains. * Whole grains are minimally processed and are higher in fiber, protein and other essential nutrients. Like fruits and vegetables, these foods can add bulk to your meals with fewer calories. * Limit your intake of refined grains like white rice, white bread or plain pasta. Instead, serve yourself 1 oz or 1/2 cup of whole grains like oats, quinoa, brown rice or whole wheat bread. 5. Monitor your intake of processed, junk foods.	Processed foods and junk foods, although tasty, can inhibit weight loss when eaten regularly.

Step 1... Do not try to work with social services. Okay okay so i know that opening line wont get many fans but hear me out... I worked with social services, I jumped through their hoops. They told me there was nothing wrong with my house, my parenting, my children's needs were met and they were happy, Case closed? Guess again... They then had a call from my daughters estranged father who had refused to see her for 18 months, telling them my daughter wasn't fed, was dirty and i wasnt coping. Now cast your mind back to my previous comment, they had no concerns. within 2 weeks my children were removed. 2. Step 2... Do not use a solicitor... or if you do make sure you do your research before hand. Alot of solicitors collude with the local authority. I have heard this myself from a solicitors mouth. Also they don't get paid enough legal aid to actually help you get your child/children back so i it takes to long they will probably drop you right in it towards the end anyhow. 3. Step 3... Record everything... invest in a dictaphone, most smart phones these days will record for hours and then put it on a computer, copy to disc (twice if possible). This is going to be your only evidence so do it religiously. As social services will lie through their teeth for reasons i will reveal at the end of this. (Believe me it will all make sense) 4. Step 4... Never sign anything! and I mean anything. They trick you into signing things at the point you are most vunerable. And you may be signing for something which will later be used against you, which you wont be able to do anything about because you signed it. 5. Step 5... Run... Run away with your children, Scotland is a good place to go as they do things different there and actually try to keep families together, failing that Ireland or even Cyprus. I never got the chance to do this, as i was stupid enough to work with the social services. 6. Step 6... Always ask and then research their jargon... Ok so doctors do it.. solicitors do it... but social workers are worst for it... speak to you in a language that may as well be foreign to you and why? So they can twist you up in knots and make you think your stupid as well as manipulate you.	Another thing they managed to screw me over with.

Become familiar with imitation jade. Only jadeite jade and nephrite jade are authentic jade. The most expensive and desirable jadeite (Burmese Jadeite, Burma Jade, Imperial Jade, or Chinese Jade) usually comes from Myanmar (formerly Burma), and small quantities are mined in Guatemala, Mexico and Russia. 75% of the world’s jade comes from the mines of British Columbia in the form of nephrite, but it's also mined in Taiwan, Canada, the United States and (in small amounts) Australia. Materials passed off as jade include: * serpentine (""New Jade"" or ""Olive Jade"") * prehnite * aventurine quartz * grossular garnet (""Transvaal jade"") * Chrysoprase (""Australian jade"" - most of it comes from Queensland, Australia) * Malaysia Jade (permanently dyed translucent quartz that may be called by its color – Red Jade, Yellow Jade, Blue Jade) * opaque dolomite marble (""Mountain Jade"" - from Asia, dyed in vibrant colors) 2. Hold it up to a bright light. If possible, examine the internal structure with a 10X loupe. Can you see little fibrous or granular, felt-like, asbestos-like intertwinings? If so, it's probably genuine nephrite or jadeite. Chrysoprase, on the other hand, is microcrystalline, so it'll look homogenous.If you see anything resembling layers with the 10X loupe, you're probably looking at jadeite that's been ""doubled"" or even ""tripled"" (thin layer of gem-quality jadeite sometimes glued over a different base). 3. Observe the density. Both jadeite and nephrite have a very high density (jadeite - 3.3; nephrite - 2.95). Density is measured by dividing the weight (in grams) by the volume (c.c.).  * A specific density gravity test can be performed as described below, or you can judge the density less accurately by tossing the stone in the air and catching it in your palm. If it feels heavier than most stone pieces of the same size, it is more likely to be authentic jade. * Another way to judge density is to observe the sound of plastic beads gently tapping each other. If you have a piece of real jade, clink it against the stone in question. If it sounds like plastic beads, then the stone in question is probably fake. 4. Hold the piece of jade in your hand. It should feel ""cold, smooth and soap like to the touch"". It should take a while to get warm if it is real. However, this is very subjective, and most helpful when you can compare it to real jade of a similar shape and size. 5. Perform a scratch test. Jadeite is very hard; it will scratch glass or even metal. Nephrite, however, can be much softer, so performing a scratch test improperly may damage a genuine piece. Use the blunt end of a pair of scissors and gently press down and draw a line on an area on the jade piece that is not visible (bottom or end of the piece). Avoid any weathering surfaces because these are much softer and can be easily damaged. If the scratch makes a white line, gently wipe it off (it might be metal residue from the scissors). Is there still a scratch? If so, it's probably not authentic jade."	.

Educate yourself about the flora and fauna of the area you are exploring. Knowledge of the local plants and animals can save your life! You might also want to purchase a survival manual to carry with you. 2. Every single time you go into the wilderness, make sure someone knows where you are going and how long you intend to be gone. That way someone will realize that you are missing, quickly alert rescuers, and be able to tell them where to start looking for you. 3. Even if you are only out on a day hike, make sure to bring the essentials. Basic survival tools such as a knife, a magnesium stone, some matches, some fish hooks, some fishing line, some cord, a whistle, and a small pot can mean the difference between life and death. It may seem like a cliché, but the best way to survive in the wilderness is to be always prepared for the worst-case scenario. 4. Panic is more dangerous than almost anything else, because it interferes with your most useful and versatile survival tool: your mind. The moment you realize that you are lost, before you do anything else, stop. Take a deep breath and stay calm.	.

If your pet is still mad discuss why you left it in the dust and tell it you will spend more time with your pet. 2. Make a nice bed for your pet. If your pet wants to sleep with you, or is scared sleeping alone on the floor, let it sleep with you. If it can't, bring its teddy or any other object it loves to sleep with it. If it still isn't happy, just let your pet sleep with you. Your pet should be comfortable. 3. Play with your pet. Would you like it if YOU were a pillow pet, just sitting there in the dust? Of course not! Play with your pet everyday. If your pet has a favorite ball, play with it. Don't force your pet into playing or your pet won't like you and will want to be sitting there in the dust. 4. Trips are F-U-N! Your pet is probably sick of staying in your house all the time.	Pack everything you need, though. If you are spending the night at a hotel, or a week at a hotel, be sure to bring everything you and your pet needs. If your pet has a favorite ball or blanket or whatever, be sure to bring it. If your pet can't sleep without that special blanket or teddy, and you forget it, tell your pillow pet you are very sorry and you will NOT forget it the next time you go on vacation and you will let your pet sleep with you.

When a lady is happy. When a woman or a girl is happy with someone or something, they may express enormous care and affection. They may seem too clingy or boring to some. But just because she is appearing clingy does not promise that she will appreciate someone or forgive someone who devalued her or hurt her. A woman keeps the reactions of people in mind. This information acts itself out at times. * If you are confused, you may ask sensitively with few words like, 'What hurt you' or 'Why exactly are you mad'? * If she has a hang of long winded explanations which you do not understand, you may be clear about it and ask her again clearly as to what really hurt her and that you did not get the point with all that she said. * When in doubt, it is best to tell her frankly about what is confusing to you. If you act frustrated or disappointed, she may not disclose the exact reason behind an occurrence either. 2. Seeking her apology. If you happened to hurt a lady, and you would like to explain yourself but do not know her mind, you must know that your approach must greatly depend upon what you did. If what you did was very insensitive towards her, she may never look at you as the same person. If what you or someone did to her does not seem to her so much, you could approach her sensitively. * The chances of being forgiven by a woman lessens if you wronged her or humiliated her deeply. * If after forgiving you she acts careless of you, it shows that she looks at the bad experiences as a painful one. You may keep this in mind and give her space and be amicable all you could. A woman is more likely to forgive someone slowly while seeing how the offender behaves in the longer run. * After being forgiven if you are confused as to why she is being humiliating or nasty or not as good as before with you, it could most probably mean that either you have not made enough efforts to make up for what you did or that you appear to be not bothered about her. * Women act random after a bad experience to show that you must care for them more. If you do not act thoughtfully with them, they may act even more hurtful and bitter. * Or another reaction when they lose any hopes from you is they wont care at all.

If you have something to share with a woman, you may first try to understand your approach. Most girls or women do not mind or do not get hurt if what they are told is said thoughtfully. The more considerate you sound and use sensitive words, the more they will be willing to listen to you to begin with. If you start off being rude or commanding, she may look at you as someone who likes to order out of ego.	.

When a lady is happy. When a woman or a girl is happy with someone or something, they may express enormous care and affection. They may seem too clingy or boring to some. But just because she is appearing clingy does not promise that she will appreciate someone or forgive someone who devalued her or hurt her. A woman keeps the reactions of people in mind. This information acts itself out at times. * If you are confused, you may ask sensitively with few words like, 'What hurt you' or 'Why exactly are you mad'? * If she has a hang of long winded explanations which you do not understand, you may be clear about it and ask her again clearly as to what really hurt her and that you did not get the point with all that she said. * When in doubt, it is best to tell her frankly about what is confusing to you. If you act frustrated or disappointed, she may not disclose the exact reason behind an occurrence either. 2. Seeking her apology. If you happened to hurt a lady, and you would like to explain yourself but do not know her mind, you must know that your approach must greatly depend upon what you did. If what you did was very insensitive towards her, she may never look at you as the same person. If what you or someone did to her does not seem to her so much, you could approach her sensitively. * The chances of being forgiven by a woman lessens if you wronged her or humiliated her deeply. * If after forgiving you she acts careless of you, it shows that she looks at the bad experiences as a painful one. You may keep this in mind and give her space and be amicable all you could. A woman is more likely to forgive someone slowly while seeing how the offender behaves in the longer run. * After being forgiven if you are confused as to why she is being humiliating or nasty or not as good as before with you, it could most probably mean that either you have not made enough efforts to make up for what you did or that you appear to be not bothered about her. * Women act random after a bad experience to show that you must care for them more. If you do not act thoughtfully with them, they may act even more hurtful and bitter. * Or another reaction when they lose any hopes from you is they wont care at all. Nothing you say will make a difference to them nor will your needs and wants. 3. Know how to approach a girl. If you have something to share with a woman, you may first try to understand your approach. Most girls or women do not mind or do not get hurt if what they are told is said thoughtfully. The more considerate you sound and use sensitive words, the more they will be willing to listen to you to begin with. If you start off being rude or commanding, she may look at you as someone who likes to order out of ego. So to speak with a girl, you must know how to begin your conversation. 4. Empathize with a woman. A woman or a girl's mind is dominated by many feelings. You may not be able to understand any of them. What you could do is empathize with whatever is bothering them. You may wonder how this will help you in understanding them? The more you empathize with them, the more they will open up with you and feel comfortable to 'be themselves' in front of you. * This states that many women are rather defensive about not being offended or randomly attacked by others. This has a high chance of them having a facade over their natural self. * The more comfortable and unjudged they feel while they are with you, the more they are going to speak their mind and get rid of their facade. 5. Dare to be yourself. The more you let yourself out, the more they are susceptible to observe this and allow themselves to be apparent. The more you hide your feelings or true reactions, the more they are prone to gauge your hesitation and react unwilling to blend in with you via conversations. Conversing is one of the major ways to understand a woman's mind. * A human is bound to have weaknesses and strengths. If you are okay with your weaknesses and strengths and are not hiding yourself, women will also open up about their weaknesses and strengths. 6. Sense her level of interest. If a girl talks, asks, shares and seeks your guidance a lot, you can tell that she feels comfortable with you. The more a woman is comfortable and at ease with someone, the more she is likely to share and bond a lot. This sharing may seem like stressful to some. But girls usually speak and share mostly with those she considers friendly and nice human beings. 7. Correct or guide a lady. This is one of the most important things that a lady would value in anyone. Someone who Women tend to be cheerful, slightly teasing, very moody, sometimes very inquisitive or curious and confused. Depending upon your rapport or understanding with them, they may act with you. Sometimes a woman or a girl can be exhausting or stressful. Sometimes their joke, teasing or laughing may take a toll on your temper. If you would like to understand a woman's mind, you may tell them the truth about how you are feeling about their behavior. They may act stunned or vulnerable but they will get the hang of how you are and act accordingly. 8. A woman's complex reactions. A lady may act quite unpredictable at times. She may seem calm from her appearance but may suddenly lose her temper or act strange. People have their own way to tackle their past experiences. Most have own mental mechanism to limit past experiences both pleasant and unpleasant from interfering in their present situations.	If you tend to feel too perplexed with them, find the time to strike the question about what bothers or dominates their mind. If they feel comfortable, they may tell you or t may not.

Learn what colors of eye makeup look best for your eyes. Pick a color that looks good with your eyes you want it to be in style and make it a bit natural so that people will think that it's natural and apply this color to your lid. Be careful with bright, bright eyeshadows like heavy greens, purples or blues. Unless used subtly and look really good on you, it will often make you look like you've been playing with makeup and your trying too hard to look older. Smokey eye usually makes you look older.

Then, for the bottom, pull down slightly and apply the liner at the bottom. 3. For the mascara, don't glob it on. Move back and forth slightly and then regularly make the lashes look like they are surrounding your eyes. 4. For your foundation, if you have any acne, take a liquid that is your color and dab it on not too thickly and then take a mineral or bronzer and a brush and gently tap off the excess. Never blow on your brushes, do you really want to rub saliva all over your face?	.

Go to church regularly. If a church is a good fit for you they will nurture you in your faith and help you surrender your life to God in the way that you want. It takes time to find a church that suits you so check out multiple churches to make sure you have found the right church for you. * You can tell a good church by whether the people there seem to be spiritually growing. If the people who attend the church seem to be joyful and excited about their faith then you may want to stick around. If not, keep looking. * Get involved and meet others! Does this church have opportunities for you to serve in ways that you would like and meet others? If the answer to both of those questions is yes, that is a very good sign. * Avoid churches that make you feel uncomfortable about showing your true self. If you feel stifled by the belief at a particular church, you may want to keep searching. 2. Do service for others regularly. All societies, cultures, and I would guess, gods promote this prosocial behavior.	.

Understand the symptoms of depression. Depression symptoms can range from mild to moderate to severe. With mild depression, you may feel sad much of the time, or you might definitely lack interest in doing activities that you once found enjoyable. In addition, mild depression will typically include a few (but usually not all) of the following symptoms: * Appetite loss or weight gain * Sleeping too much or too little * Increased agitation or decreased movement * Low energy every day * Feeling worthless or having inappropriate guilt * Difficulty concentrating 2. Recognize seasonal affective disorder. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) affects more people during the fall and winter months and subsides in the spring and summer months. Seasonal depression may be caused by the body getting less sunlight. This may mean that the body produces less serotonin, a chemical that affects mood. Recognize the symptoms of SAD: * Increased need to sleep * Fatigue or reduced energy * Lack of concentration * Increased feeling of wanting to be alone * These symptoms typically go away in the spring and summer, but they can still produce mild depression in the winter. 3. Pay attention when you have the blues. If you feel like you’ve got a case of the blues, it’s important to pay attention to your symptoms to see if you’re becoming depressed. You may experience more frequent feelings or symptoms, or your symptoms will last for longer than 2 weeks. * If you’re unsure about the progression of your symptoms, ask a trusted friend or family member for their opinion.	.

Try acupuncture. Acupuncture is a part of traditional Chinese medicine that uses needles inserted at specific parts of the body to correct energy blocks or imbalances., Find an acupuncture specialist in your area and try this procedure to see if it helps reduce your symptoms of depression. * One study has shown a link between acupuncture and normalization of a neuroprotective protein called glial cell line derived- neurotrophic factor, and comparable effectiveness with fluoxetine (the generic name for Prozac). Another study has shown effectiveness comparable to psychotherapy. These studies lend some credibility to acupuncture as a treatment for depression, but more research is needed to support the effectiveness of acupuncture. 2. Consider taking St. John's Wort. St. John’s Wort is an alternative medicine that has been effective in small-scale studies, especially for milder forms of depression. If you are not taking SSRIs (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) or SNRIs (Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), considering trying it. * In large-scale studies comparable to those needed for FDA approval, St. John’s Wort has failed to be more effective than a placebo.	.
Write_a_High_Fantasy_Series.txt	Begin_Revision	0.736	## Steps	1496	And always put obstacles in the way of your character .	## Steps	1539	In addition , always put obstacles in the way of your character .	<insert><In><1>|||<insert><addition><1>|||<replace><And><1><,><3>	True	Steps  1. Create a world. Start with a random shape of a continent, with ragged coastlines. Add in mountains, forests, and other geographical things. Then divide it into kingdoms and territory. Put in races to fill this continent. A good idea, that is done rarely, is to break the cliche of just one continent and islands and make a entire world with several continents. After this write a short history report on your world about wars, the origins of races, and notable heroes and their deeds. 2. Read up on articles that will help you. A few links are below, with articles about fantasy, a breakdown of high fantasy on the Wikipedia, and a fantasy novel to help you along.Work on your map and history, adding and detailing. 3. Make characters.Give them all habits and backgrounds. Even if you don't use them in the story, even minor characters should have a bio. They should have human traits like chewing on fingernails, or talking to themselves. Give them a personality basis are they cold, caring, obnoxious, good at heart but grim and cold on the outside. This will help you determine a lot of things like their looks, biography, and other things. Feel free to break from stereotypes. Not every hero is handsome or beautiful, not every soldier is grim and uncaring. The best characters don't fit a mould. 4. Make your plot. The plot should start out with an average person but is entranced into the fantasy side of your world. Like Eragon finding Saphira's egg in the Spine, or Frodo receiving Bilbo's ring. These are good examples, and if you can't think of anything then imitate this but don't copy. Like someone stumbles upon a strange necklace in the forest and the character becomes a target of an evil king or evil spirit who has minions to do their bidding. 5. Start on your plot, and gradually rise. It should start out with an Expository, where your character and a day in his average life is told, then the problem is introduced. Then the problem gets worse, like his town is burned. Then serious, as he sets out for revenge. Then you reach a climax like a fight against a minion. Minions are best, because if the main character wins and then the story ends. High fantasy was made to spread into a long series. 6. Have them change. Like Rand Al'Thor is as a stubborn farm boy who comes to change to an iron willed leader against the Shadow. Change shouldn't be quick. Their loss of attachment to the old life should take a book or two. 7. Keep going with your series, and never be afraid to try something.	It gets boring after a while of the main character mindlessly going after the villain and killing minions every now and then. Maybe a friend gets captured, he decides to help defend a village against the villain, he seeks a mentor, or maybe even THEY get captured. That would definitely help with step five.

Await an answer. Once your lawsuit has been filed, the defendant will be required to answer within a set period of time (usually 21-30 days). When the defendant answers your lawsuit, they will be required to admit or deny the allegations in your complaint. In addition, they will be able to make counterclaims and motions in order to move the case forward in their favor. * Read the answer carefully to gain insight about what the defendant is going to say at trial. * If the defendant makes any counterclaims or files certain motions, you will be required to answer them within a certain time period. You will be served with the counterclaims, which will contain direction for how to proceed. 2. Conduct discovery. Discovery gives you and the other party an opportunity to collect and exchange information that could help your case. During discovery, you will collect facts, interview witnesses, get an idea of what the other party will say at trial, and determine how strong your case is. To help you conduct discovery, you will be able to use the following tools: * Informal discovery, which includes interviewing witnesses, collecting publicly accessible documents, and taking photographs. * Interrogatories, which are written questions posed to a party or witness. The party must answer these questions under oath and the answers can be used at trial. * Depositions, which are in-person interviews with other parties or witnesses. The interviews are conducted under oath and the answers can be used in court. * Requests for documents, which are formal requests for documents that are not publicly available. Examples include emails, internal memos, or policies and procedures. * Subpoenas, which are court order requiring someone to do something. 3. Defend against a motion for summary judgment. After discovery, the defendant may try to resolve the case through a motion for summary judgment. In this motion, the defendant is asking the judge to rule in their favor because there is no genuine dispute of material facts and the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. They will do this by submitting evidence and affidavits with the court. If the defendant wins, the lawsuit will end and they will win. * To defend against this motion, you will need to file a motion yourself, along with evidence and affidavits, claiming there are disputed issues of material facts. The judge will view all evidence in a light most favorable to you. If you win, the lawsuit will continue. 4. Attempt to settle. If you are still litigating your case, now may be a good time to try and settle. Settlement talks may start during a settlement conference with your judge. When this happens, you and the other party will meet with the judge to discuss the case and whether it can be settled. The judge will not make any legal determinations but will help nudge both parties toward a settlement. If you need help coming to an agreement, you might use other alternative dispute resolution tools. For example: * You might take part in mediation. During mediation, a neutral third party will sit with both parties and discuss common ground and ways a settlement might be reached. The mediator will not make any conclusions of law and will not tell either party whose case is stronger. Their sole job is to help each party engage with the other and find a way to resolve the dispute. * You might take part in arbitration, if mediation does not work. During arbitration, a neutral third party will act like a judge and cast opinions about your case. Each party will present evidence to the arbitrator in the form of witnesses and other evidence. When done, the arbitrator will write an opinion making conclusions about whose case is stronger, who should get an award, and what amount the award should be. Most arbitration at this point is non-binding, which means neither party will be required to follow or agree to the terms of the arbitrator's opinion. 5. File pretrial motions. Right before trial, a series of pretrial motions may be filed by either party. Pretrial motions are submitted to the court requesting that the judge make a decision on something. If you file a motion the other party will have an opportunity to respond (and vice versa). Some common pretrial motions include: * A motion to dismiss, which asks the judge to dismiss the case because there is not enough evidence or because the facts do not amount to a cause of action. * A motion to suppress, which asks the court to suppress evidence because it does not meet the evidentiary standards of the court. * A motion for change of venue, which asks the court to move the trial somewhere else because of some bias or concern (e.g., a biased jury pool or a highly publicized trial). 6. Go to trial. If all else fails, you will go to trial and attempt to win your case in front of a judge or jury. At the beginning of trial you will choose a jury (if you choose to have one) during a process called ""voire dire."" When the trial begins, you will make an opening statement and so will the other party. You will then have an opportunity to present your case while the other party will have an opportunity to cross-examine your witnesses (and vice versa). At the end of the trial, you and the other party will give final closing statements."	.

Familiarize yourself with the Beck Depression Inventory. There is a lot of information online about the administration and scoring of the Beck Depression Inventory. It's a good idea to do some online research before you begin. Here is some valuable information about the inventory: * It is a 21 item self-report inventory . * It is used to evaluate depression in both clinical and non-clinical patients. * It was developed to be administered on adolescents and adults, so it can be used by anyone 13 and above. * It uses a rating tool where each item is rated on a four point scale from 0-3. * 0 means you are experiencing no symptoms, while 3 means you are experiencing a severe form of the symptoms. * The inventory has been translated into various languages. 2. Read the test items carefully. In order to use this tool for self-administration or to administer it to someone else, you should first read all of the items carefully along with the instructions. A sample item is provided below to give you an idea about what type of questions you can expect: * 0: I do not feel sad * 1: I feel sad some of the time * 2: I am sad all the time * 3: I am so sad or unhappy that I can’t stand. * This is how the items will be displayed. You have to encircle the item (0 to 3) you think depicts your condition the best. 3. Get acquainted with the administration procedure. This is very important for administering the inventory. First of all, you have to rate the items based on your condition during the past two weeks as well as they day you administer the test. * Furthermore, you are required to choose the higher number on the 0-3 scale if you feel that multiple statements depict your condition equally. * For example if you think 2 and 3 are equally representative of your condition, choose statement number 3. * Lastly, item 16 (changes in sleeping pattern ) and item 18 (changes in appetite) have to be rated on 7 point scale instead of the normal four point scale. However, these items are not given any more weight than the others when calculating your results. 4. Try to administer the test in a distraction free environment.	You should give the test your undivided attention. Any needs should be fulfilled before taking the test.

Sooner or later, mammals began to form whose minds were made slightly more complex than their predecessors. They possessed the limbic system, also known as the emotional brain, which is a crucial part of all relationships between different beings. It comprises of hundreds of subtly different emotions ranging from compassion to anger. What we know as fear is predominantly controlled by the amygdale, which triggers the ‘fight or flight’ response, used in order to escape adversity such as a predator. Humans are still suffering from this system to the point that it has been activated to auto-pilot and heavily affecting even the smallest facets of life.	With this new system came our natural aptitude to think deductively and to act with free will. In order to ensure the survival of the human species, the amygdala had to overtake the neo-cortex in certain predicaments to make sure the being knew what they were up against. This now results in conflict between the limbic system and neo-cortex, with the more primitive level of brain having the advantage over our logical thinking.

CBT works to restore the application of the neo-cortex to confront our fears or unnecessary delusions that are the root cause for all the burdens we experience in our lives. 2. Observe your thoughts. The first thing to know is that thinking and consciousness are totally discrete facets of the brain and have no relationship with each other. Your thoughts are simply an incessant voice reverberating around the hollows of your mind, constantly judging or speculating about whatever we encounter. The true self has nothing to do with your compulsive thought processes; it is just an observer of the world and of the immortal concept of being. Our mind often achieves full control over our true selves since we let us get swept away with whatever thoughts or emotions arise. We are like beggars, depending on all the external objects for enjoyment while the joy can be easily discovered within ourselves. This short sense of pleasure often rapidly transforms back into feelings of pain. The only way you can stop this addictive cycle of maintaining the ego is by passively observing that voice or mental array of visual imagery that is usually present within the mind. Throughout your day, inquire about your current thoughts and determine whether they are useful or just the mind trying to receive attention. You will then become connected with a higher level of consciousness, or become one with Being which comprises of everything that exists. It is impossible to be lonely since you consist of the same conscious energy that formed all the matter of the world. The main catalyst of worry is thinking about your future or dwelling upon the past. If you’re tuned into the moment, you will find that there is nothing to be fearful about and it was just an illusion of the mind or ego. About eighty to ninety percent of our thoughts are useless and impede our natural creativity that is achieved through quiet. In all creative work that has ever been accomplished in the world, thinking remained a small fraction of the entire creative process. You may also attract your focus your daily events by applying the full use of all your five senses in the scene. For instance, if you are washing your hands, feel the texture of the water against your skin, smelling the fragrant scents of soap and tuning in to the sound of the television in the other room. Once you have learned to ‘see’ your thoughts as they are happening, they will lose their power over you and a state of pure consciousness, quietude, or elation will follow, temporarily providing relief or authentic joy. With practice, you will be able to lengthen these phases, until you have achieved full authority over your mind rather than the other way around. 3. Look for cognitive distortions. These are just illusions derived from the more primitive levels of the brain that we use all the time, without even consciously realizing the ludicrous nature of these interpretations. It is important to start discerning these negative thoughts that we normally apply unconsciously since the emotional brain is too overpowering to allow us to correctly analyze our current situation. There are ten main types of cognitive distortions to be prepared for that can be easily turned around during the secondary appraisal stages of the mind. This doesn’t cover up the fact that you may feel an intense urge to identify yourself with the compulsive thoughts or emotions of the body; it takes a lot of patience and will power to comprehend the anomalous nature of the occurrences. Once you begin to spot the fluctuating patterns of cognitive distortions, it will eventually become automatic to just dismiss them for what they are. Core beliefs may form when a cognitive distortion is repeatedly enforced upon oneself, most often during childhood, until it becomes their sense of self or who they actually are. Remember, the ego is just an imagined identity derived from past and possible future occurrences. It is not a true part of who you are. The only way you can remove these beliefs is by asking yourself repeatedly whether it is truly useful to your well being in the long run. Will this sustained thought alter your current situation? This is called the cost-benefit technique, and if used properly it should discard any ideas that are ingrained into your sense of self. The term schema refers to any method of thinking that is developed to help one make sense of the world. These can include stereotypes, non-authentic theories or names attached to specific situations. It is a crucial fact that we all experience cognitive distortions or schemas in our lives; it is the way that we become conscious of or treat these thoughts that truly matters in the long run. Unless someone was born with a very calm and amiable disposition, we are all affected by the primitive areas of the brain. If you see people who seem very composed and good at handling stress, they are probably using CBT without even knowing it. If this is not the case, then they are hiding something and are afraid to show their true self. There is no other option since the discrete layers of the brain usually work independently of each other with the same intensity, allowing function in all areas. Anyone can learn this since it is a technique widely used for people with disorders such as OCD, insomnia or generalized anxiety disorder. Even post-traumatic stress disorder, which involves full- fledged core beliefs, can be affectedly treated by exposing them to the illusory part of the brain. You don’t necessarily have to have a current condition to use this affective technique. All that is necessary is some common sense and a willing to put in the work required to be successful. 4. The fourth stage of the technique involves dealing with your cognitive distortions, the most important of all the five steps. Begin by taking your time reading through the various distortions that are identified by leading psychologists. The first distortion is considered all or nothing thinking, or when you wrongly come to the conclusion that you can either be absolutely perfect at something or else you are horrible at the activity. Some people may use overgeneralization, which is when just because an ordeal happens once; it will continue to happen no matter what the previous experiences you have in that field are. The third distortion is the tendency to dwell exclusively on negative details of an event, even when the majority of your experiences have been considered positive. It is as if the positive actions are completely forgotten or blacked out, known as monotropism. This psychological term refers to the inability to see the whole picture, and instead focusing on the individual aspects of a task or situation. In the fifth distortion, people think that they have the supernatural ability to predict the future or analyze a person’s body language, even thought there remains a lack of conclusive evidence to make such a wild assumption. When using the binocular trick, someone may magnify the importance of an event in order to make it seem greater than it actually is. Some individuals make the mistake of thinking that their emotions reflect reality or the way things are. Other people force unattainable tasks upon themselves, personalize a situation or attach labels to themselves as if it reflects who they actually are. All of these assumptions are completely rash or impetuous, due to the falsified ego trying to maintain its full authority over you. To effectively analyze these thoughts, the first step is to identify which of the ten distortions are most applicable to your life. Write down or record a time when you previously experienced one of these thoughts and begin to interpret them. You should specify three main points; the underlying cause of the negative thought or emotion, what the possible side effects of keeping the sustained thought are and how you could rephrase the thought in a totally new way that becomes understandable to the neo-cortex, or your logical mind. The last step is the most crucial factor which can determine your overall detachment to the thought and be the difference between success and failure. You may not be able to escape all of life’s inevitable adversities, but you can modify the way you ‘perceive’ such an event. By gradually altering your thinking habits, you will begin to alter your life for the better. 5. At first the above work may seem like a monotonous task, but if continued you will gradually you’re your logical part of your brain more dominant when it comes to abhorrent situation. Taking a scientific viewpoint, scrutinize the following sentences to learn in more detail what systems are responsible for the stress response. There are two systems of the brain that will play a key role in your goal of diminishing the illusory nature of your mind. The sympathetic nervous system is the structure that brings up the fight or flight stage, making you more alert, focused and prepared for whatever encounters lie ahead. On the other hand, the parasympathetic system slows your brain and body down, gradually restoring you natural heartbeat or rhythmic breathing. This is why deep breathing is often used to calm someone down, in order to activate the second structure. Since the systems work completely independently of one-another, it is not uncommon for the sympathetic parts to go overtime, causing an unnecessary loss of energy and even a higher risk of contracting myriad cancers. Don’t be frightened by this sad reality, because then you are using the same system from the back door. Just learn to calm down after the stressor has passed, during the second appraisal stages. When Neanderthals went hunting for food and saw a possible predator in their midst, the first structure was activated rapidly, causing him to either run away or face the danger head on. Without the use of the parts that counter-act the stress response, he would have ceased to exist because of the exertion of unnecessary action even after the event has passed. This, in turn, would make him more vulnerable to further enemies in the near future that could prevent the evolution of a more sophisticated species of human. Modern day humans dominated the Neanderthals because they could think more clearly about their actions and conservation of energy. The same thing happens in ordinary life; if you ignore the function of the second stage, you will most likely perform poorly since you are not living in the power of now.	.

Observe and inquire within what the lower arrows points to. Emotions are a reflection of the thinking mind in your body, so the lower right arrow points to the involuntary emotions that come in response to internal and external environment and the 'lower left' arrow represents conditioned reactive emotions that come in response to conditioned thinking. Again, don't get attached to any words or images but look inside yourself. In fact, you don't even need to classify the thoughts, emotions, reactions and external or internal stimuli as shown, but simply watch or witness whatever comes and goes. Your awareness is primary and greatest agent for inner transformation. * Reactions in this context means conditioned mental-emotional response to an event (internal or external) or thought or emotion. 2. Watch the emotions. Just like consciousness or attention gets lost in thoughts, similarly it gets lost in emotions. So watch the emotions the same way you watch the thoughts to reclaim trapped consciousness from emotions. When you watch, consciousness is withdrawn from the mind, and light of presence or consciousness grows within and the ego begins to dissolve. There's a possibility that the thinking mind may reflect negative emotions in the form of negative thinking. Such as when pain body gets activated or when you pick up someone else's contagious negative energy, which may make your thinking extremely negative. Whatever the case may be, allow and accept it to be. * Watching also means accepting or allowing it to be, because watching implies you don't react or desire something to be different than it is. You allow and accept the ""is-ness"" or ""suchness"" of the moment. Buddha called it Tathātā. For example: when you totally and unconditionally accept the imperfection of your body, you simply watch and allow the imperfection to be there, without wanting it to be different. * ""Freedom from desire means this: the compulsion to satisfy is absent."" Nisargadatta Maharaj. * More fundamentally, you allow or accept the thoughts and emotions that come in response to the imperfection."	That's when an infinitely more powerful answer comes from deep within. You need to inquire very deeply and be honest with yourself to see any unconscious resistance and desire of not wanting a situation or condition or some thoughts and emotions to be there. Again, you can only go truly deeply when you are rooted in being or the mind will take you over like a wild river.

Be confident in who you are. If you act like you're not sure of your sexual orientation, people will assume your bisexuality is just a phase or you're not sure of your sexual orientation yet. If you beat about the bush, you might come across as ashamed. 2. Consider who you want to tell first. It is usually easiest to tell people who you know will be supportive, like your close friends or parents. This will help build the confidence that you will need to tell the rest of the world. It will get easier the more people you tell. 3. Think about telling your parent(s). If you are fully dependent on your parent(s) and you don't think they will accept you and be supportive, you may want to consider not telling them until you are no longer dependent on them. 4. Consider that many people do not have a clear understanding of what it means to be bisexual. Some people may think that you are just trying to get attention or that you are gay but unwilling to admit it. A good way to counteract this is to say ""I'm attracted to people, not to genders."" Be very clear about who you are, what you mean, and why you are telling them. 5. Be calm and rational; be sure of what you are saying and explain that this is a part of you, and knowing who you are makes you happy. 6. Be proud of who you are; your sexual orientation is never something to be ashamed of, it is only one tiny part of all the character that makes you who you are. *"	People who make that kind of comment usually don't have an intelligent reason for doing so.
Twirl_a_Baton.txt	Begin_Revision	0.902	## Steps	187	But you may discover that when you go quickly , you 'll revert back to the basic hold and steps .	## Tips	238	However , you may discover that when you go quickly , you 'll revert back to the basic hold and steps .	<insert><However><1>|||<replace><But><1><,><2>	True	Steps  1. Hold the baton vertically. Use your index finger and your thumb to grip it loosely in the center. If you are new to twirling, you may want to add your middle finger between your thumb and index finger, on the thumb side, as though you are holding a pencil. 2. Turn your wrist so that the back of it faces up and slightly to the left. (I'm right handed, so if you're left handed, then reverse all the directions.) 3. The baton should be just about horizontal. Turn your wrist so the back of your wrist faces up. Follow through the last turn of the wrist, so that it looks like you are pointing to people in an audience in front of you. It should be smooth. The baton should now be pointing forward. 4. Now that the back of your wrist is facing up, turn your entire forearm so that the inside of your wrist faces up and the tip of the baton that started out pointing up is now pointing forwards and slightly down. Again, make it smooth. Almost all of baton twirling has something to do with making the moves smooth and not awkward. 5. From that position, pull the baton so that the end furthest from you now points towards you. The baton should not be in a vertical position, but rather slanted. 6. Repeat these steps, but instead of starting from a fully vertical position, start from the slanted position you ended up in. Go slowly and build up speed as you go. It should look a little like a helicopter's spinning blades, but with a slight twist in the middle. 7. Develop your own style.	Also, take baton twirling lessons. They really help.

Call the vet if you suspect any of these issues. There are many potential causes of eye problems in horses, from allergy, trauma, debris, as well as other diseases. * Any over the counter eye wash for human or equine use is appropriate for a horse and can make the animal more comfortable. Such washes can be applied liberally and contain no medication. If no sterile eye wash is available water can be used to rinse debris from the eye. * If your horse is older, there are occasionally eye problems that might, for example cause the horse to spook or knock into things."	.

Find out the name of the musical and then either find a script, a movie or a CD to give you a full understanding of the types of characters involved. Try and meet the director and tell them about your interests, your training and desires. 2. Choose two characters you think you could play well. You don't necessarily need to love a character to play them well. 3. Remember not to limit yourself to starring roles. They take more effort and more memorizing, and if you are a beginner, it might be too much for you to handle. Many actresses started small, but were noticed in minor roles by talent scouts. 4. Ask yourself why you chose these two characters or the main one and write your answer in a pad. It might be helpful to you later, if you get either of the parts. 5. Find out the specific date/time of your audition and the scheduled performance dates so that you'll know if you have anything that will interfere with the shows. This will also tell you how long you have to practice. 6. Ask how the audition process will go. Some good questions are: do you need to have a song or monologue prepared? How long will the audition take? What roles are available? Will there be an accompanist or do you have to bring in a karaoke CD. 7. Pick a song that's right for your voice type and show you are auditioning for. Don't sing anything like rap or a rock song because it is a major turnoff for a casting director unless that is what they're looking for. If the show is something energetic such as Legally Blonde the Musical, you'll want to do an upbeat musical theatre song, not a ballad. Usually they'll ask for about 16 measures (they can be whatever 16 measures in a row that show off your range the best). Also though this may sound stupid make sure it fits your range. 8. Other times they'll give you a song. In that case they will probably give it to you before hand. If they don't ask. 9. If a monologue is required, find something that you can connect with. It doesn't have to be well known, and if you mess up don't let the directors know. Make something up and then when you remember the correct lines begin to get back on track. 10. You'll most likely dance. If you aren't the best dancer like me then fake it. Sometimes personality can make up for your terrible dance moves. Always try your best and don't get discouraged if they move really fast. SMILE!!! 11. Often, the director/s will not show much reaction to your performance, but that doesn't mean they aren't paying attention. If they cut you off midway through a song or monologue, it means they have heard enough to judge you on, not that you're bad. Remain confident and friendly no matter what. 12. NEVER apologize, stammer, flinch, prattle, stare into the director's eyes, squeal, try to make conversation, beg, brag, kiss up or compliment, go overboard, scurry out, scurry in, act overly exited or hyper, act sluggish or bored, or exhibit any obnoxious behavior. Ever. 13. Portray yourself always as poised, confident, calm, and happy. think of it as a showcase of your talent or a show you're putting on- that can help. 14. Try not to be disappointed if you are placed in the chorus or ensemble. It's fun! In musicals, the ensemble makes up most of the cast. Extras require less rehearsal time. And they have more dancing, singing, costumes, scenes, and general camaraderie, not to mention they don't have to worry about forgetting a thousand lines. 15. If you get a lead, prepare yourself to be consumed with memorizing lines, singing constantly, attending rehearsals, and generally pushing every other aspect of your life aside including boyfriends or girlfriends, parties, schoolwork (to a point), playing on the computer, relaxing...everything. You will be working constantly. If you want a lead, you had better LOVE the theatre with your whole heart. Its a lot of work. 16. Remember- sometimes, these things are unfair.	But whatever happens, accept it with grace. Never demand another audition. Always be kind and respectful to the directors and the person who got the part you wanted, even if you are cursing at them inside. But try to avoid that too.
Wash_a_Car_by_Hand.txt	Inside_Revision	0.809	## Tips	6188	And do n't use fabric softener .	## Tips	9751	But do n't use fabric softener .	<replace><And><1><But><1>	True	Tips  * Don't keep the water running while you wash your car. The average home wash will use between 80 and 140 gallons of fresh water. Buy a hose sprayer with a lever that shuts off the water when you let go. * Don't use dish-soap to wash your car. It'll strip off the wax. * Make sure you start from the top of the car and work your way to the bottom, cleaner to dirtier. * Wax (or one of the newer polymer products) protects the paint from the sun and prevents fading, and protects it from the road-grit kicked up by the vehicles in front of yours on the highway that would scratch your paint. Polymer products wear longer than wax. And the ones purchased at auto supply stores are just as durable as the ones the car dealers charge $450 to apply. * Don't forget to shut all the doors and windows before washing. * Glass cleaner can get the windows a little clearer than can just car wash soap and water, but drying them with microfiber towels after washing the car can make them sparkle just as much. Clean both the insides and outsides of the windows. * Don't wash or wax your car in direct sunlight. This would evaporate the water too quickly and bake on the soap or wax, leaving a dull residue that would be difficult to remove. * Use vinyl/rubber/plastic conditioner for dark-colored plastic parts and tires. * Microfiber towels work the best on all of a car's surfaces. When you're finished using them, toss them in the washing machine.	It can leach out of the towels and leave a residue on the surface.

Be respectful to your teachers. You may think that it's cool and funny to be mean to your chemistry teacher, but when your midterm grade rolls around and your C+ was not rounded to a B-, you'll have another thing coming. Though you won't love all of your teachers, it greatly benefits you to be polite to them, show up to their classes on time and at least act interested in course material. Sleeping in class is highly unadvised. * When you apply to college, you'll need several teacher recommendations, so it's better to start building your relationships early. 2. Have a solid tailor-made study plan. If you want to succeed in your first year of high school, then you have to know which habits do and don't work well for you when it comes time to study for the big exam. Do you study best during your free periods, right after school, or at night, before you go to bed? Do you like listening to music or snacking while you study, or do you prefer nothing more than silence and a cup of tea? Find a routine that works for you early on and stick to it. * If you work better in groups, then find a study group made up of academically-minded young people so you can motivate each other. Do this only if you think you can really get work done this way. * Become a master note-taker. Taking notes in class will help you study when exam time comes. * And, obviously, avoid all nighters. You will feel panicked and horrible, and too exhausted to do well on the day of the big test. Block out time to study at least several days in advance before a big test. * Try to review a little each day. It's hard to get yourself to review for half an hour two or three weeks before a test...but imagine cramming that many hours the night before. Plus, you'll retain the information much better. 3. Do your homework. This should be obvious, but it isn't. Don't do your homework on the bus on the morning of school, or in homeroom, either. Take the time to diligently do your homework right after school, in study hall, or when you get home after extra-curricular activities. Make sure that you really get it done instead of just doing the bare minimum and forgetting key information. Plus, this practice will help you to study for the test. *	.

Work_Out_in_the_Pool.txt	Begin_Revision	0.943	### Walking in Shallow Water	7817	As you get more accustomed to the movements and the exercise , you can increase your workout time .	### Walking in Shallow Water	7950	Once you get more accustomed to the movements and the exercise , you can increase your workout time .	<replace><As><1><Once><1>	True	Walking in Shallow Water  1. Find a pool with ankle- to knee-deep water. This might be the children's pool, or it could just be the shallow end of a local, regular pool. Start with ankle-deep water and, as you feel more confident, move to water that is knee-deep. * This is ideal for those who are rehabilitating from illness, for pregnant women, and for anyone who feels that exercise might be too strenuous or cause injury after a period of inactivity. 2. Walk through the water. Make sure you are walking heel to toe, rather than just on your toes. The buoyancy of the water can make it harder to complete a normal stride. You may need to focus on foot placement when you first begin. * Try to maintain your normal stride, and notice the resistance that the water provides. Moderate walking on land can burn about 130 calories per half hour, whereas walking in the water, against resistance, burns approximately 260 calories. 3. Start marching laps. Walk through the water and bring your knees up high with each step. Swing your arms to propel your body if the movement seems difficult. Try to bring your legs up as high as they will comfortably go with each step. * Flex your stomach and try to bring your thighs parallel to the surface of the water. This is a great exercise for the abdominal muscles as well as the thighs. 4. Walk sideways for several laps. Turn sideways in the water and move your legs directly sideways against the resistance of the water with each step. After several laps, turn around and lead with the opposite foot. * This activity will help work the inner and outer muscles of your thighs, as well as your abdomen muscles. 5. Do forward lunges. Step forward with one leg and bend your knee to a 90 degree angle. Keep your hands at your sides, straighten your front leg, and then lunge forward with the opposite leg. * Switch it up by doing side lunges. When you are walking sideways, bend your leading knee to a 90 degree angle, lean into the lunge, then raise your body and repeat. Make sure to do the same number of lunges on the opposite side for an even workout. 6. Continue for as long as you feel okay walking in the water. The resistance of the water on your legs strengthens them, burns calories, and helps to build water confidence for harder exercise stages. * Shoot for 30 to 45 minutes sessions each time.	.

Format your document. The owner might have sent you a bid proposal form, which you should use. If not, you can create your own by opening a blank word processing document and setting your font to something that is readable. Usually, Times New Roman 12 point is acceptable. * You can also look for templates or sample construction bids online. Use them as a guide as you draft your own construction bid. 2. Provide identifying information. At the top of the page, you need to include basic information. For example, put the words “Bid Proposal” at the top of the page in bold. Include the following information beneath the title: * Your company’s name, address, and telephone number. * Name of who you are submitting your proposal to. Also include their company name and address. * The date you are making your bid and the date your bid expires. 3. Identify the scope of work. Spend the most time on this section, because most conflicts arise over specification. The client thinks you agreed to do something, which they believe was in your estimate. Be as detailed as possible and strive for no ambiguity. * For example, if you’ve been hired to build a deck, you should just write, “Composite-type decking to be fastened with hidden fasteners.” That’s too vague. * Instead, identify the decking more clearly.	If the owner is selecting the color, then state that as well.

Swim_Freestyle.txt	Begin_Revision	0.967	### Kicking and Rotating	10474	When you rotate your body left and right with your alternating arm strokes , your body should be moving in the water about 30 degrees from the surface on both sides .	### Kicking and Rotating	10548	As you rotate your body left and right with your alternating arm strokes , your body should be moving in the water about 30 degrees from the surface on both sides .	<replace><When><1><As><1>	True	Kicking and Rotating  1. Flutter kick just below the surface of the water. Although kicking accounts for only 10-15% of the power in your stroke, it is still an important part of your freestyle technique. Keep your hips close to the surface of the water and make a series of quick kicks. You want to focus on minimizing drag while you propel yourself forward; therefore, your kicking range of motion should be narrow. Your legs should not kick out of the water and neither should they break below the line of your body. * Kick from the hips and thighs. Do not kick from your knees, this is called a bicycle kick, and it will cause more drag. You may slightly bend your knees while you kick, but this should not be where your power is coming from. 2. Use the two-beat kick. The two-beat kick requires less power and is used by long distance and middle distance swimmers. You kick one leg per stroke cycle. One stroke cycle means the stroke of one arm. Kick one leg in conjunction with the insweep of the opposite arm. (The insweep is when the arm starts pulling water toward the midsection of the body.) If you can think about how your arms and legs sync while you are walking, how your arm moves forward at the same time as the opposite leg, you can imagine how your kicking should be synced with your arm stroke in a similar way. * The six-beat kick requires that you kick three times per arm stroke cycle. The third beat of the kicking cycle will start during the recovery phase. This is a faster kick that is used by faster swimmers. 3. Point your toes while you kick. If your toes aren’t pointed while you kick then there will be extra drag caused by your exposed forefoot. Your toes should face inward, and your big toes should come close to touching as you kick. When you point your toes, you are exercising the flexibility in your ankles. If you are having difficulty with ankle flexibility, consider using mid-length flippers to practice your kick. * You can focus on both your freestyle arm and leg techniques more easily with the extra propulsion that flippers provide. But only use your flippers to help train your feet during drills. 4. Practice kicking drills. Push off the wall with your feet in the torpedo position with your hands and arms extended out in front of you. Keeping your head under water, kick vigorously for as long as your breath will last. You do not want to focus on going fast, instead, try to focus on your technique: * Keep your toes pointed, your feet pointed inward so your toes are almost touching, your hips up, and your kick high. * Keep your legs relaxed, and kick from your thighs. * Repeat this drill 3-4 times. Then swim a lap of freestyle. While you do your freestyle lap do not focus on your kick. Only keep your big toes slightly brushing each other. You should notice that your kick has improved. * If after a while you may feel like need to focus on your kick again, repeat the drills again. 5. Rotate your body in line with your arm stroke. When you are rotating correctly, you are able to put more power into your arm stroke. In addition, when you rotate your body you minimize drag, and it will enable your to breathe properly.	You should be swimming mostly on your stomach instead of your side. Do not rotate your body until you are on your side at a 90 degree angle.

Start at square one. A capital gains tax is a tax on the profits from the sale of an asset. The asset could be virtually anything, such as a home, a piece of land, stocks, bonds, collectibles—even an intangible asset, like a trademark or a patent. * In this sense, capital just means money, and gains mean profit. * Most people’s income comes from wages, and that’s mostly what ordinary income tax covers. So think of income tax as a tax on wages, and capital gains tax as a tax on selling things. 2. Decide if capital gains taxes even apply to you. If you derive all or most of your income from wages—a paycheck from an employer—then capital gains taxes probably don’t apply to you at all.	.

Oftentimes the subject Nerd will disregard eye contact, and avoid any acknowledgement that they are involved in a two-way conversation. 3. If within a few minutes the individual is able to steer clear of a dogmatic desire to talk about a specific topic, you may have a geek on you hand. Or perhaps a dork.	However, for the sake of science I will make a clarifying statement. A dork is a geek with well developed social skills. A geek on the other hand does not have the dogged determination like a nerd to stay on one topic. They are more rounded than nerds.

The 4 mil plastic is an alternative to traditional waterproof sheets. The plastic sheeting you buy from hardware stores is very durable and should last for a long time. Another advantage of buying a roll of plastic sheeting is that you can cut the plastic different lengths. There are a number of other benefits to buying this type of plastic: You can cut off several sheets of plastic to use as bedwetting covers(while one sheet of plastic is drying on the clothesline you can cover the youngster's bed with another sheet) and it's good to have some plastic sheeting on hand because you can put the plastic to good use. (see below) * In addition to cutting off plastic to use to protect the bed from bedwetting there are a number of other uses for this type of material as mentioned earlier. Some of these uses include the following: you can cover outside materials such as firewood,lumber,mulch,plants during the winter time,and patio furniture;you can use it as a drop cloth; the plastic can be used for concrete and masonry work; it can be used as a weed barrier to put under mulch in flower beds,you can use it for raking up leaves,as a cover when doing remodeling work,as a vapor barrier for insulation,as well as many other tasks. With that in mind even if the child or teenager finds the crinkling of the plastic unpleasant and would like you to use another type of material to cover the bed, there are still many other uses for the plastic sheeting. * Some people use all types of waterproof sheets to protect the bed from bedwetting: vinyl shower curtains,table cloths, as well as other types of plastic. For instance Vicki Lansky in her book “Practical Parenting Tips” talks about using plastic garbage bags under the bed and another book on bedwetting said that any type of plastic can be used as a bedwetting cover. Given this, it's not much of a stretch to try the hardware store plastic out.	.

File your initial complaint. As with any civil case, you initiate a class action lawsuit by filing a complaint that lists your allegations against the company you're suing and the injuries or financial losses you've suffered as a result. * Your attorney will collect information from you regarding your injuries or losses and develop a legal theory as to how the company you want to sue is liable for those injuries or losses. He or she will then draft the complaint setting forth the allegations against the defendant and a calculation of the damages to which you and the other plaintiffs are entitled as a result. * You must be able to demonstrate that all the members of your class suffered similar injuries or losses as a result of a common set of facts or legal interests. * Once you and your attorney have filed your complaint, it will be served on the company you're suing so the company has notice of the lawsuit. The company then has between 20 and 30 days to file an answer or other response to the lawsuit. * The defendant's response typically also will include a motion to dismiss. In this situation, you must work with your attorney to respond to the motion and attend the hearing. 2. File a motion to have the class certified. One of the most important parts of class action litigation is having your class certified. If the judge doesn't grant your motion and certify the class, your complaint may be dismissed. * In some states, the court will initiate the certification process for you – all you have to do is check the class action box on the cover sheet you fill out when you file the complaint. * Other states and federal courts require you to file a motion asking the judge to certify your class. 3. Attend the hearing on your motion. Typically the judge will schedule a hearing on your motion to have the class certified. If you are the lead plaintiff, you must show up for the hearing along with your attorney to argue that the judge should certify the class. * If you've opted not to be the lead plaintiff, you typically won't need to attend this hearing unless your attorney intends to call you as a witness. * Since the trial has not yet started, the judge assumes all the allegations in your complaint are true. This hearing concerns whether a class action is the best way to resolve the numbers disputes, not whether the company is liable for any injuries or losses the class of plaintiffs suffered. 4. Prove the class action's efficiency. To win your class certification motion, you must show the judge that a class action is the best and most efficient way of resolving all of the plaintiff's claims. You also must show that your claims are virtually identical to the claims of the other class members. * Your class must meet federal requirements as well as any additional requirements in the state where you've filed your lawsuit, or the judge won't certify the class. * Typically it's easier to have a class certified in a consumer law dispute involving financial losses than it is in mass personal injury lawsuits. Individual injuries may differ substantially, and the size of the class can be all but impossible to determine. * Since you don't have to prove the truth of your allegations, it may be tempting to shrug off the class certification process. However, this often is the most important part of your case – especially given that most class actions never make it to trial. *	This is when you send a message to the company you're suing that you're not going away.

Using Electric Smoke, you will be able to create a very damaging smoke screen that electrifies about a second after deploying. While dangerous, something like an Ogre can just rush through it and only take about 1 bar (if their shields or down). Or, something like a Stryder can just spray through the cloud or dash through very fast, avoiding most damage. 2. To use the Electric Smoke to it's full efficiency, stealth is a very good way. The perfect partner to Electric Smoke is Cluster Missile. While not only deadly independently, it is very good to cause an extremely large amount of damage when paired with Elec. Smoke. 3. Also, a very good way to use Elec. Smoke is to use it as a damage zone. It stops lock on's, and even an Ogre will get all of his shields depleted (half of them if he has Shield Core on) which gives you a fighting chance to kill him or cause heavy damage. 4.	If they try to jump down (backwards), they will be stuck and die. If they jump straight up, you can punch them. All the titans have enough reach to kill the pilot instantly. If they jump to the sides, you will still be able to see them. Just hit the punch button to kill them (Usually, the punch will automatically target them, even if they jump very far to the side).

Perhaps this person will help you speak the way a southern gentlemen would speak. 4. Next, learn to be a gentlemen. It doesn't matter if you are from the south, north, east, west coast side of the United States. You can be a gentlemen any where and at any time. Speak with an older gentlemen and start to learn how a gentlemen conducts himself. 5.	A mixture of being a gentlemen and southern hospitality is perfect. In a way you have mastered by this step how to be a southern gentlemen. You can even try and date a woman from the south and test out what you have learned.

Prepare your betta's home. Here are some points to consider: 1. Choose a home. In the wild, bettas inhabit Thai rice paddies. Hence, they are fitted to living in relatively shallow but spacious environments. However, you should still consider giving your betta a decent sized tank to help prolong its life, since waste can build up very quickly. Naturally, more water is better, but a 5 gallon tank is an acceptable size for your betta fish. If you wish to keep your betta with other fish or aquatic animals, then you will need a tank of at least ten gallons. * If you choose a larger tank you will enhance its quality of life. 2. Decorate your betta's home. One of the betta's distinct features is its ability to breathe oxygen in both the air and the water, so you will not need to supply aeration. You might decorate your betta's home with gravel/colored stones, silk plants, and a small cave-like structure to hide in. A creative home is a happy home! Remember to add a gentle filter and small heater. * Do not use jagged rocks or decorations for your tank, as they tear your betta's fins. * Be wary when buying hard plastic plants, as they can be rough on your betta's fins. A good trick is to use the 'pantyhose test': If a plastic plant will snag a pair of pantyhose when rubbed against it, then it will damage your betta's fins. Be safe and buy silk plants instead. * While live plants aren't necessary, they are a great addition to a betta tank. Their appearance is better than the plastic or silk ones, and bettas love to lounge on leaves and to have a hiding place in which to sleep. 2. Prepare the water. If you use water fresh from the tap, use a water conditioner before you put it in the tank, as the chlorine and chloramines can harm your betta. Older sources may suggest aging the water, letting it stand for a period of time. It is best to use a water conditioner, since aging water will remove chlorine but not chloramine and heavy metals. 3. Fill your tank. If your tank does not have a top cover, then fill it about 80% high. Bettas are very active fish and can jump over three inches when motivated, so this will ensure that it does not jump out of the tank. * If your tank does not have a top cover, you can a mesh cloth over the top to ensure that it does not jump out. It will be much happier if it has access to lots of air as it does breathe at the surface along with in the water. 4. Test the water temperature. Be sure that your tank is maintained at a constant temperature of 78-82 degrees. Purchasing a small heater is a good idea, since the temperature of the water is likely to be much cooler than room temperature and can fluctuate easily. 5. Cycle your tank. This step is important to the health of your fish. 6. Purchase your betta. There are some considerations for choosing your betta. 1. Visit your local pet store or the vet. You should have a general understanding of what to look for before purchasing your betta. 2. Observe the available bettas. There are a few qualities that you should look for when choosing a betta fish: * Color. Is the betta bright and vivid in color, or does it appear very dull and pale? Bettas come in a variety of colors, so don't be surprised by the choices available. Blues and reds (dark colors in general) are the most common. * Receptiveness. Does the betta respond to your movement at all? Does it appear to swim around rapidly at the sight of you, or does it merely sit at the bottom and sulk? You shouldn't repeatedly tap on the container, as you will only agitate the fish, but you should find a way to see if it pays attention to you.	Bettas will generally have many encounters with other people during the day, and may simply be taking a brief rest.

Use less. Less is more as you age so it’s important to use less product on your face. Try using half the amount of foundation you usually do or try mixing your foundation with your favourite moisturizer for a sheerer, more modern look. Be sure and blend your foundation right down your neck so that you look as if you’re wearing no makeup at all 2. Try using foundations that are moisturizing and non drying. As you mature your skin requires more moisture and using a foundation rich in moisture will help you look soft and beautiful 3. When using concealers, use a very small amount and blend well so that the product does not sit right into your lines and wrinkles 4. Take a look at your makeup bag and toss out or give your daughter or granddaughter any eyeshadows that have shimmer, frost or glitter in them. These products look great only on young plump skin but for 40+ skin they get into your fine lines and wrinkles and accentuate them. Instead look into purchasing matte eyeshadows in soft natural colours. 5. Change your lipstick colour. Many women continue to use the same lipstick that looked great on them 20 years ago when most often the colour is no longer suitable for their lip size and skin tone. Opt for colours that brighten your face and compliment your makeup look 6. Learn how to re-apply your makeup every decade. Just as it’s important to initially learn how to apply makeup when you’re a teenager, re-learning the right technique for your age range is vital in looking and feeling age appropriate at all times 7. Be sure and use mascara on all your eyelashes even the little ones as this creates a more youthful look.	Purchase mascara in brown or black-brown and stay away from coloured mascara’s. These are great for 20 year olds but not appropriate for 40+. One or two coats of mascara should be enough to create an opened eye effect

Understand the federal laws regarding wages. The federal government has set minimum wage standards that are applicable throughout the entire country. Although your state or municipality could provide greater benefits, the federal government sets the floor for the entire nation. * Minimum wage. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. The wage applies to all employees except certain employees, such as farmworkers on small farms, employees at seasonal and recreational establishments, and executives or administrative professionals paid on a salary basis. * Overtime pay. Federal law requires that employees be paid “premium pay” at 1.5 their base rate of pay for any hours worked in excess of 40 during a workweek. There are certain exemptions for the overtime rules as well. 2. Find your state laws. Your state has the option of providing a greater minimum wage or increasing the situations in which you must be paid overtime. Your state’s laws can be found by visiting this page from the Department of Labor (DOL) website. * Minimum wage. Some states have set a minimum wage at a higher level than the federal government. For example, Alaska has a minimum wage of $8.75 an hour, while Oregon has a minimum wage of $9.25. * Overtime. Several states, like California and Nevada, require overtime pay for hours worked in excess of eight a day. Accordingly, if you worked 10 hours in one day, then two of those hours must be compensated at premium pay—regardless of whether you worked more than 40 hours in a week. California also requires double pay (200% your base rate) for hours in excess of 12 a day. *	In California, you must be paid time and half (150%) for the first eight hours worked on the seventh day.

Learn what car insurance covers. All states require registered vehicles or drivers to have some liability insurance. This covers bodily injury expenses including medical bills, rehabilitation expenses, and lost wages. It also covers property damage expenses including the repair or replacement of anything belonging to the driver of the other car. * If you are at fault in a car accident, your car insurance pays for the damages that you cause to the other driver through liability insurance. It pays for any damage to your car or yourself through collision insurance. Most people have a plan that includes both liability and collision insurance. 2. Understand the parties involved in the claims process. Usually, after a car accident, two or more insurance companies are involved in the claims process, one company for each driver involved in the accident. Both claims adjusters negotiate with each other to get the best settlement possible for their insurance companies. * Your claims representative will try to shift blame for the accident onto the other party. The representative will also try to reduce the amount of your settlement. So, if the claim will be paid entirely by the other driver’s insurance company, your claims adjuster will probably be much more helpful during the claims process. 3. Realize how insurance companies calculate the value of a claim. The insurance companies first decide the monetary amount of your damages. Then, they decide how much of that cost they will pay. Two things are important to insurance companies when determining how much they will pay you in a settlement: * the strength of your liability claim * the extent of your damages 4. Prove that the other driver was negligent. You can't recover money from an insurance company unless “liability” exists. To show liability, you must prove that the other driver was “negligent,” which means the other driver was careless. Some examples of driver negligence are: * not seeing another vehicle that should have been seen * following too closely * driving too fast for the circumstances (weather, visibility) * making an unsafe turn * disobeying traffic signals or signs * talking on the phone or texting while driving. 5. Consider if you were also negligent. If both you and the other driver contributed to the cause of the accident, your claim may be completely defeated. The insurance company won't have to pay anything, or a reduced amount. * In states that have “contributory negligence laws,” you cannot win a claim if you were the least bit negligent, even as little as 1%. In states that have “comparative negligence laws,” your claim will be reduced in proportion to your fault. 6. Perform a rough estimate to calculate your settlement. Most insurance companies use a software program to determine the amount of damages you'll get.	Here's what the insurance software looks at:

Take your small pet to your veterinarian. Your small pet will be better able to handle the stresses of travel if he is in good health and physical condition. If you are traveling between states with him, you will probably need a certificate of health from your veterinarian as proof that your small pet is disease-free. Even if you are staying within the state, making sure that he is healthy is still a good idea. * Ask your veterinarian for a copy of your small pet’s medical records. * If your small pet is on any medication, make sure that you will have enough to make it through the trip. If not, obtain a refill from your veterinarian. * If your veterinarian determines that your small pet is not healthy enough for travel, consider keeping him at home and making plans for someone to take care of him while you are gone. Keep in mind that most small pets would prefer to stay at home rather than travel. 2. Identify veterinarians at your destination. Make a list of the veterinary hospitals at your destination. Doing this beforehand will help alleviate the stress of finding a veterinarian in case your small pet needs emergency medical care during your trip. Alternatively, you could bookmark the websites of the veterinary hospitals on your phone or laptop. 3. Have identification for your small pet. It will probably not be practical to place a collar and identification tag on your small pet. As an alternative, place an identification tag on your small pet’s travel carrier and regular cage that contains his name and your phone number. 4. Make a hotel reservation at a pet-friendly hotel. Do your research to identify the pet-friendly hotels in the area where you will be traveling. Be mindful that a pet-friendly hotel may not have many rooms in which they accommodate travelers with pets. In addition, you may have to pay a hefty convenience fee to reserve a pet-friendly room. 5. Learn about your airline’s regulations on traveling with pets. Traveling by car is the best way to travel with a small pet. However, if your destination necessitates travel by plane, you will need to familiarize yourself with your airline’s rules and regulations for pet travel.	.

Locate and read your state’s custody law. Each state has a law concerning custody, which lists the factors that the Court will consider in making a custody determination. In order to win a custody hearing, you will need to concentrate on these factors first. To find your state’s laws, use the map or the links on Child Custody Coach’s Child Custody Laws by State webpage. Some of the factors the Court may consider include: * The age and sex of the child. The Court may look at the age and sex of the child because generally the younger the child, the more he or she needs his or her mother, but as the child grows older, he or she may need his or her same sex parent to a greater extent than the other parent. * The physical and mental health of everyone involved. If either of the parents is mentally ill or suffers from a physical condition, which may affect his or her parenting, the Court will take this into consideration. * The wishes of the child (if the child is of a certain age, usually 14). While a child does not get to decide which parent he or she will live with, the Court will consider the child’s wishes. * The child’s adjustment to his or her home, school, and community. When parents live in different communities, the Court may be reluctant to move children who are well adjusted to their current home. * The child’s relationship with each parent and his or her siblings and extended family. The Court may be reluctant to move a child who has bonded with his or her siblings into a home where the siblings will not be living. * Each parent’s work schedule. Work schedules that require a parent to be absent from the home for long hours may not be ideal for a parent seeking custody. * Which parent is more likely to ensure that the child maintains a relationship with the other parent. * Which parent has been the child’s primary caregiver. If one parent has done most of the care giving for the child, the Court may not want to remove the child from that parent’s home. * If there has been a pattern of domestic violence or abuse by one of the parents against the other, or against the child. 2. Think about what other things may help the Court decide to give you sole custody. The Courts do not rely completely on the factors listed in the child custody statutes, and any evidence you can present which tends to show that you should have sole custody should be considered. This may include the other parent’s cleaning skills and fitness of his or her home, parenting skills, drug or alcohol use, ability and willingness to participate in the children’s extracurricular activities, the other parent’s criminal history, or inability to communicate with you in order to co-parent the child with you. 3. Find out what the other parent plans to say at the hearing. In order to be fully prepared, you must know what the child’s other parent intends to say about you at the hearing. To do this, you will need to send him or her a set of Interrogatories. Interrogatories are questions that a party to a lawsuit must answer under oath and return to you with his or her answers. You can use your favorite search engine to locate a form for interrogatories and then modify to fit your needs. Some common questions to ask in custody interrogatories include: * Do you believe that you are the best parent to have custody? If so, why? * Do you believe that [insert your name here] is a bad parent? If so, why? * When was the last time you used illegal narcotics? * List all anticipated exhibits. * List all witnesses you intend to call. Indicate their name, address, and summarize the testimony they will give. * Do you and your child’s other parent communicate well? If not, why? * Do you believe that it is in your child’s best interests for you to have sole custody? If so, why? 4. Gather evidence, which supports you having sole custody. Think about each factor that your state’s Court will consider when making a custody decision and what evidence you have to support your contention that you should have sole custody.	Conversely, if the child currently lives with his or her other parent and has poor grades, you may want to use the report card to show that the child has not adjusted well to the other parent’s home.

College events are lot different from the compulsory events you might have done in high school. Because no one is forced to participate, the people who are there enjoy being there on their own. It's no secret that the real draw of clubs and events is the social aspect. You'll probably meet a lot of people with similar interests, a few people you don't get along with, and a few people with absolutely amazing backgrounds. C'est la vie: it's a cross-section of life. * Take the time to do clubs and events outside your immediate social circle. It's fine to invite your best friends to participate in your club's activities. But what if bringing your friends along means that you wouldn't have met another potential friend? Try to meet as many interesting people as possible during your time in college. Don't make friendship an exclusive right shared only by you and your inner circle. 3. Go to parties. College parties are almost a mythical unicorn: built up so much by Hollywood and expectations that they're almost bound to disappoint. Well, almost. Most college parties look nothing like the kind of parties you see on TV. (Depending on the school you go to, however, there are some pretty tremendous party atmospheres.) Be yourself, put a smile on your face, and get in the mood for meeting new people. Who said ""success"" was just about academics? * Be a gracious party-goer. Don't litter bottles around someone's room, make a mess in someone's kitchen, or use someone's bed without their permission. Bring cups or soda, or if you're old enough, beer or wine. It's never bad being the person that the host takes a liking to because they're generous and well-mannered. * Be careful about drugs. Know which drugs are likely to really harm you and which drugs are milder. (Alcohol and marijuana in moderation aren't likely to put you into the emergency room, but cocaine, meth, hallucinogenics, and painkillers can all be potentially fatal.) Some students find that college is a time to experiment with drugs, but follow your conscience. Don't do anything you're not comfortable doing."	.

Will the coven be able to trace it's lineage back to Gardner? Probably not. Unbroken lineage is rare. Does it matter? No. Wicca is a religion and can be practiced by anyone, just like any other religion. There is no real transfer of power during initiation and initiations and titles mean something to some people but not everyone. So relax if your friend is all caught up with titles and initiations and don't be intimidated by it. There are however, as in all things, people who believe that a strict adherence to one group's methods is the one and only true way. Watch out for this as people can be touchy with it.	If they insist, then run! There is absolutely nothing that you should be asked to do that will make you uncomfortable. There are some groups that have leaders that also use the wiccan religion as a way to lord power over others and puff themselves up by saying they are the High Priestess and they deserve special attention. If this is the case, roll your eyes and walk away. This is not the ONLY way and you can find a group that will suit you where everyone can be treated equally. You know how there is Presbyterian, Baptist, Lutheran, Catholic, etc... for Christianty? Well, in Wicca, there is Gardenarian, Alexandrian, Celtic Reconstructionist, Traditional, Eclectic, etc... How someone begins their religious practice will more than likely be determined by what branch of Wicca they follow.

Write down your desired flextime schedule. Brainstorm several schedules that you would be okay with and write them down before asking to meet with your employer. Think through what your at-home obligations are and what your job at the office requires of you. Write out by hand or on your computer several proposals for a flextime schedule. * For example, maybe you want to be able to pick your child up from school every afternoon at 3 pm. You could propose working from 7 am to 2:30 pm every day. * If you have a long commute, you could write out a plan that allows you to work from home 2 days a week, making sure that you are in the office on the days there are team meetings. * Maybe you would like to work 4 days a week instead of 5. Propose working from 8 am to 6 pm Monday through Friday. * Questions to consider: can the office function without you being physically present during the 9 am to 5 pm work hours? If not, is there someone else who can take over some of your responsibilities? Will you have better productivity if you’re working from home and not interrupted by your coworkers? 2. Schedule an appointment to speak with your employer. Either send an email or ask your employer in person to set a time to get together to discuss your work schedule. An hour would be a reasonable amount of time for you to go over your proposed flextime schedule and talk through any questions or concerns. * Asking for an appointment rather than springing the conversation on your employer gives them time to prepare mentally, too. 3. Address your desires and present potential concerns. Explain why you want to change from a traditional schedule to a flextime schedule. Be honest about your work-life balance and how working a nontraditional schedule will help make you a happier and more productive employee. Try to bring up issues that you believe will be a concern for your employer and the solutions you have discovered. * For example, if your employer counts on you to open up the office everyday, and you want to start working from 10 am to 6 pm, you could propose training another employee to take over that responsibility. 4. Explain your plan for working a flextime schedule. Things to address include: making sure you will still be able to fulfill all of your employee responsibilities, how you plan to communicate with your employer and coworkers, having a plan to measure your productivity, and the actual hours and days you will be working. * The most important thing to remember when proposing your schedule change is to make the benefits to your employer very clear—why is it advantageous to them for you to work a flextime schedule? 5. Overcome objections respectfully. Practice what you can say to common objections so that when they come up in your meeting, you are ready to respond. Be clear and respectful when you speak—be pleasant and inquisitive rather than argumentative or defensive. * For example, if your employer says that they are concerned if you start working flextime that others will want to do the same, you could say something like, “Most employees prefer to work traditional hours, and this flextime schedule would be a good fit for me. Could we give it a try?” Or, “Maybe they will. Working a flextime schedule can make employees happier and more productive. I’d love to help the company figure out if this is something we can implement.” 6. Agree to a trial period of 3-6 months.	This gives you an opportunity to share your growth and productivity, and it creates accountability between you and your employer. If your employer is not on board, suggest a trial period as a reasonable way to see if the flextime schedule is feasible for you and the company.
Write_a_Letter_of_Complaint_to_Human_Resources.txt	Begin_Revision	0.839	### Complaining About Harassment	3479	Instead , the person reading the letter might become angry at you .	### Complaining About Harassment	3580	In fact , the person reading the letter might become angry at you .	<insert><In><1>|||<replace><Instead><1><fact><2>	True	Complaining About Harassment  1. Identify workplace harassment. Sexual harassment is one form of workplace harassment, but it isn’t the only form. You can harassed on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability, age, or genetic information. Consider the following behaviors, which may be harassment: * derogatory remarks or slurs based on the protected characteristic * intimidation * threats and physical assaults * telling offensive jokes 2. Write down details about the harassment. You’ll want to give Human Resources as much information as possible. Accordingly, you should sit down and write down the following: * Who harassed you and their relationship to you. You can be harassed by a supervisor or by a co-worker. Also, the harassment can come from someone as the same sex as you. * When each harassing act occurred—date, time, and location. Also write down what the person said or did, and how you responded. * Who witnessed the harassment. Write down their names and job titles. 3. Format your letter. Set up your letter like a standard business letter. If you know the name of the contact in Human Resources, then include that in the salutation. However, if you don’t know who to address the letter to, then write “ 4. Introduce yourself and your purpose. In the first paragraph, you should give HR some idea why you are writing to them. For example, you should state that you want to lodge a complaint about sexual harassment and identify your harasser.center 5. Lay out the facts of the harassment. Be clear and get to the point. You want to provide enough information that HR can see there is a harassment problem. Explain where and when the harassment occurred, as well as who witnessed it.center * Describe the incidents in chronological order, which is the easiest for people to understand. * In some larger organizations, HR might not know everyone, such as a coworker. You should identify who they are, e.g., “Jason Jones, who works in the cubicle next to me, saw our boss make the obscene gesture.” * Stick to the facts. You shouldn’t make any kind of allegation or charge that you can’t back up with proof, such as your written memories or a witness. For example, don’t speculate about your boss or coworker’s motivation for what they said or did. You don’t know that. 6. Explain how you responded. This is legally important. If you welcomed the harassing behavior, then you haven’t been harassed according to workplace discrimination law. You should state what you did or said in response to the harasser's conduct. * Also explain if you tried to resolve the issue. For example, you might have met with your harasser and asked them to stop making jokes. Tell HR the outcome of your attempted resolution. * Remember to explain how the harassment made you feel. Let them know if you became ill or started missing work to avoid the harasser. 7. Propose a solution. At the end of the letter, you should state what you want from HR. For example, you might want to be transferred to a different department. You can also request that HR investigate and punish your harasser. However, you should probably avoid telling HR to “fire” your harasser. That’s their judgment to make.center * Remember to end the letter by thanking HR for their time. Insert “Best” or “Sincerely,” and then sign the letter. 8. Avoid using offensive language. Although you may be angry, you should try not to show it. Using foul language can only undermine your ability to get help.	.

Create a friendly, low-pressure environment. The child will feel less nervous if they feel that they are in control. If they want to stop, or take a break, or do something else, pay close attention to what they say and do it. * If the child doesn't want to ride the horse, don't pressure them. Ask if they would like to take some time first, or if they would like to leave. Perhaps a quieter hobby would be more suitable. 2. Introduce steps one at a time. Autistic children may have sensory issues that make new experiences seem especially intense or frightening, so it's important to take it slowly. For example, let them try on the helmet and wander around with it to get used to it before putting them on the horse. * Explain how each step works. This will help them anticipate what will happen next, and understand the bigger picture. 3. Choose a small, calm horse for them to ride, and avoid showing them the larger or easily-spooked horses. If they get scared by a horse, they may be resistant to the idea of riding one. 4. Acquaint them with the idea of riding horses first. Give a kid-friendly explanation of what will go on, and let them meet the horse. Answer any questions they might have, and offer to let them feed the horse a carrot or sugar cube. 5. Ask if they are ready to get on the horse before putting them on. This way, the child feels in control of the situation, and will feel proud for being brave and succeeding.	.
Take_Care_of_Lizard_Eggs.txt	Begin_Revision	0.931	## Steps	18	BUT , just because they hatch faster does n't always mean they will hatch better .	### Part 3: Knowing About Types of Eggs	78	However , just because they hatch faster does n't always mean they will hatch better .	<replace><BUT><1><However><1>	True	"Steps  1. The first thing you should do is research the lizard species who laid the eggs. Find out what incubation temperatures you need to incubate the eggs and how long you need to incubate them. Purchase an incubator and set it to the desired temperature. Hovabator incubators are inexpensive and work well for most species of lizard. You can find these at a store that sells farm supplies as these incubators are used for incubating bird eggs as well. If you do not live near a store you can buy them online. If there is no store near you and you can not wait to have an incubator shipped to you, you can make an incubator. 2. To quickly make an incubator you will need a 10 gallon tank, a fish tank heater, a brick or two and plastic wrap. Place the bricks in your tank and fill it with water to just below the top of the bricks. You will place your eggs in a container and sit it on top off these bricks when you are ready to incubate. Next, put the fish tank heater in the water and set it to the temperature you want to incubate the eggs in. Lastly, seal the top with plastic wrap to hold in the heat and humidty. 3. So now you are ready to incubate, but what about a container? And what do you put in the container with the eggs? Depending on the size of your eggs you can use different sized plastic containers. Small eggs you can put in deli cups, medium sized eggs you can put in sandwich containers and large eggs in rubbermaid containers. In your container you will need to fill it halfway with some kind of incubation medium. This can be damp moss, vermiculite,perlite or hatchrite. Each medium should not be wet but damp. After wetting the medium, the best way to judge correct dampness is by squeezing it hard so that there is no more water dripping off. It is now ready to be put in your container. 4. Alright, now you are ready to remove your lizard eggs from the enclosure and put them in the container but first there is something you need to know about reptile eggs. 24 hours after an egg is laid, the embryo inside attaches itself the the wall of the egg and starts growing. If you jiggle or rotate the egg, the embryo will come unattached, drown and die. It is very important that when removing an egg, you keep it in the same position it was laid in when you are picking it up and putting it in your container. Before you pick up your egg make an indentation with your finger in the incubation medium where you want to put your egg. Put your egg in the indentation and take a sharpie or pencil and mark a dot on top of the egg. This will tell you what is rightside up incase the egg accidentally gets shifted. You will be able to put it back into position and hope for the best. Place multiple eggs about a fingers width apart from each other. Tightly close your lid on the container and put it in the incubator. Write down somewhere the date of when the eggs were laid and calculate when they should hatch and mark it on your calendar. 5. Check on your eggs periodically. After a week or so you should check on your eggs and see if they are growing. Buy a small white LED light, take out your container, go in a dark room, open the lid and shine the light as close to the egg as you can but be careful not to press on the egg or move it. The inside of the egg will glow and you should see pink, red or maybe a few blood vessels inside. This means it is alive and growing. If it glows yellow, either the egg is infertile, dead or not enough time has passed to see growth yet. Close up the container and put it back in the incubator for another week or so and then check again. After a month you should see something if it is alive. Eggs that are infertile or dead will turn an off-white or yellowish color and eventually grow mold and/or cave in. Good eggs usually stay bright white and swell over time as they are growing. It is good to check on eggs every one to two weeks during the whole incubation process. Each time you check, you can see how they are developing and the eggs will get fresh air every time you open the container. Do not open the container anymore than this though, they could lose too much humidity if you do. 6. While you wait for your eggs to hatch, set up an enclosure for hatchlings. Make sure you have everything you need including food. Most lizards will need to be put in small cages lined with paper towels in the first few weeks of life. Substrate could be ingested or stuck on babies, this is why paper towels are used. If your species is arboreal, put in a couple branches or fake vines. Add a small water dish or get a misting bottle ready if the species only drinks water droplets(ex. chameleons and tropical geckos). Make sure the cage has the proper heat and humidity for babies. Babies will usually shed their first shed in 24 hours and you need to make sure it all comes off. Having the proper humidity will ensure you don't have shedding issues. Some babies require less heat than adults so you need to research specific heat requirements for babies of the species you have. Baby lizards usually start eating after a couple days of hatching, so be ready with the food and your calcium/vitamin supplements. 7. There are different types of egg layers. Some lizards lay numerous eggs in one clutch and they are usually buried and not stuck together. Some examples are Bearded dragons, monitors and chameleons. Some lizards lay only two eggs at a time, usually buried and not stuck together. Some examples are anoles, crested geckos and leopard geckos. Then you have your egg gluers (ex.Giant Day geckos, Tokay geckos, White-lined geckos and many others). These are geckos that usually lay two eggs that are stuck together and are usually stuck to something inside the cage, most often a branch or the glass of the enclosure. These types of eggs have a hard shell and if you try to separate the eggs or remove them from whatever they are stuck to, they usually break and die. If the eggs are stuck to glass you can try removing them gently with a razor blade. Be VERY careful and slow so you do not break them. If the eggs are on a branch, try to remove the branch and place it in the incubator. Do not try to remove them from the branch or they will break. Try to tape a plastic cup on the branch if it is too big to fit in a container. You don't want baby geckos loose in the incubator after they hatch. If none of this works for you and you are afraid the parents will eat the babies, tape a plastic cup over wherever the eggs are laid in the cage. Some geckos will guard their eggs and babies so you don't have to worry about this (Tokay and White-Lined geckos are two examples). Just keep the cage warm and humid and the eggs should hatch without any issues. If they are Tokay gecko eggs, watch out! Tokays will defend their eggs and babies and will not hesitate to bite you if you try messing with them. 8. There are some lizard species that do not need incubators. For example, most chameleon species, crested geckos (and other Rhacodactylus species) and any other lizard that comes from a mild climate where it isn't hot can be incubated at room temperature. Room temperature means somewhere in the 70's. For these species I put their incubation containers in a dark place inside my house, like in a closet, under the bed or under a table etc. I check them once a week or so to make sure they are growing well and wait till they hatch. Very easy. 9. Some things to consider...some species of lizard are what's called ""temperature sex dependant"" when it comes to incubation. This means if you incubate at a certain temperature you will get either males or females and if you incubate in the middle of these temperatures you will get mixed sexes. Research the species of lizard eggs you have to find out. Also, when you research what temperatures you need to incubate eggs of any species you will see that there is a range of both temperatures and days of incubation. For example let's say 82-87 degrees for 60-90 days would be the range you found for your species. The warmer you set your temperature, the faster your eggs will hatch. So, if you set it for 87 degrees, they will most likely hatch around 60 days."	Many times the longer the eggs are incubated, the stronger the babies are when they hatch. Whatever you decide to choose (in your temperature range) will probably produce good results, but I just thought I'd throw that in there for you all to think about;)

Even if you’re fit, moving suddenly in new ways is tough on the body, to say nothing of the fact that flipping upside-down will make you dizzy if you haven’t warmed up. Be sure to give your wrists extra attention, as you’ll be putting all your weight on them. 3. Learn how to do a handstand. If you haven't already, it's essential that you master this step before moving on. 4. Get a trainer or a knowledgeable friend to spot you. This person’s job will be to stand a safe distance in front of you to catch and then hold your calves while you're in a handstand. They can also stand behind you, but you’ll need to be careful not to kick them on your way into position! 5. Get in the proper stance. Extend your arms straight above your head with your palms facing forward. Keep your elbows fairly straight so that they don’t give beneath you. Then, point one foot in front of the other. Turn the other foot slightly outward for better balance. 6. Look down at where you are going to place your hands. This will help you guide your aim and stay oriented. 7. Get into a handstand. To do this, you will need to perform several actions at once: * Shifting your weight to your pointed foot, lean over at the waist . Your extended arms will swing down towards the ground in front of you. * As you lean downwards, start lifting the leg with no weight on it. Since you’ve shifted your weight to the foot in front, your back leg should left naturally. Simply keep that leg straight and use the momentum of your downward swing to propel it upwards. *	As your hands make contact, your second foot will rise; the momentum of your other leg, which is already almost in place, will help propel this leg upwards.

Also the external antenna needs to be wired back to your GPS console as well and connected to your GPS receiver as well. 2. Familiarize yourself with your GPS device. I can't stress enough how important it is to read the owner's manual of your device and get familiar with the particular model of GPS you own. Since the basic principals of operating a GPS are very similar there are differences between models how they function. Also reading the manual will educate you on the various terminology that you may not understand otherwise. 3. Ensure that the proper map is installed on your device. The map is a n essential component of the GPS device so we can visualize and see where our vessel is located at. There are multiple types of charts or maps out there, however the important part is to select or install the map of the particular region you navigate in. Regional maps provide better details than world maps for example. So you need the detailed map to be able to see in detail where you exactly at. 4. Basic functions of the GPS or Chartplotter device. Once everything is connected and the proper map is loaded on the unit now we are ready to navigate. Usually, the screen will show a boat or a triangle on the map that is your vessel in relation to the map. The device should show your GPS coordinates and a scale of distance as well for your information. So now you can zoom in our out on the map by pushing the zoom in or out button on your device. The more you zoom in the greater details you get but your visibility of your surroundings is reduced so find a happy medium where you have enough details and also you can see a few miles ahead as well. Next move the cursor (boat or triangle) to the desired destination you want to navigate to and mark your destination. Most of todays GPS units will automatically calculate the distance and time based on your speed of your boat to the destination set.	So basically this is the basics of using a marine GPS.

Find PokéStops that are blue. Once you use a PokéStop, it will turn temporarily purple, indicating that you have visited it recently. PokéStops that are purple need time to reset before they will yield you more items, so head back to your map to look for a PokéStop that is blue if you'd like more items. * The time it takes for a PokéStop to reset seems to be five minutes. If there are no other nearby PokéStops, you can wait around the one you're currently at and wait five minutes for it to reset. 3. Level up for better items. As your trainer gains experience, you will gain access to better items at PokéStops.	However, as you level up, you'll have a shot at finding the full selection of items in the game, including:

There is not empirical evidence that indicates someone's star sign affects their personality.	If you're a believer in astrology, you can try letting it dictate how you pursue a Scorpio. Try to get a Scorpio's attention by being driven, mysterious, and interesting. Plan dates around a Scorpio's interest in the mysterious. To maintain the relationship, stay loyal and trustworthy. If you break a Scorpio's trust, it can be difficult to win it back.
Survive_the_First_Month_of_New_Motherhood.txt	Begin_Revision	0.841	## Steps	811	But you still have plenty to do .	## Steps	859	And you still have plenty to do .	<replace><But><1><And><1>	True	Steps  1. Remember to enjoy that baby. The first few days and weeks will be rough, and you might be tempted to forget that you are in the midst of a miraculous and wonderful change. So even though you will be tired and sometimes stressed, do remember to soak in the joyful parts of the day. 2. Make things easy for yourself by keeping materials and supplies close by the places where you will be using them. If you are nursing, move your most comfortable easy chair into the baby's room. Set up a table next to the chair with a bottle of water, your glasses, a clock, maybe some music, and anything else you will routinely need during nursing. You are going to be up in the middle of the night and you might as well be comfortable. If you are bottle feeing, keep everything you need for formula preparation conveniently grouped on the kitchen counter. You don't want to to be searching in the drawers and cupboards in the middle of the night for the lid of the bottle. 3. You may have a perineal incision which will require washing with each trip to the bathroom, which will require certain equipment. There is also a possibility of hemorrhoids. Again, make things easy on yourself by putting all those materials within easy reach of the toilet. It is going to be tempting to run off and see to the baby every minute, but it is important to take care of yourself too. 4. Sleep when the baby sleeps. It's essential to avoid sleep deprivation so that you can remain alert when caring for the baby. Know how much sleep you need per day and get it in bits and pieces, sleeping when your baby sleeps, and napping when your baby naps--avoid the temptation to hover over the crib. Place the baby on his or her back and keep the crib or bassinet near you with no pillows, quilts, or toys (a light blanket can be placed below the baby's arms and tucked in lightly along the bottom half of the crib). If you choose to co-sleep, read up on how to do so safely. 5. Don't expect perfection from either yourself or the baby. The idea is to get through this tricky period of adjustment in the best way that you can. Just keep in mind that ninety percent is an A. If you are managing to keep the baby fed, and in clean diapers, and you are staying alert to any medical necessities, you are doing great. 6. Get yourself and the newborn on a schedule right away, to the extent that you can. Newborns sleep a great deal.	But don't expect to get it all done. Things are different now. You are living in a new world, where it will be difficult even to get your shower in. Try to stick to some semblance of a schedule, but keep your 'extra time' free...this is no time to volunteer to help out at the PTA meeting. Just feel free to concentrate on you and the baby. Try to keep things picked up but don't stress over the dusting and the vacuuming. Some of that kind of thing is just going to have to wait until you get back on your feet.

Treat spasms with over the counter pain relievers. Sometimes muscle spasms can cause extreme pain. Ask your doctor about taking over the counter pain medicine, such as nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDS). These include ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen sodium (Aleve). You may also try acetaminophen (Tylenol). 2. Take muscle relaxers. If you have an injury or a muscle that is causing continuous or repeating spasms, you should see your physician. They can prescribe medicine that will help relax your muscles. * Medications such as anticholinergic agents can help intestinal spasms that do not respond to diet and lifestyle changes. * Talk to your doctor if any medicine you take causes muscle spasms. 3. Talk to your doctor if spasms are chronic. You should be able to treat muscle spasms at home.	The spasm might be an indicator of an underlying problem that needs treatment.
